4	ZSJnW6faaNFQoqq4ALqYg	If you were a fan of the original restaurant (Grand China) when it first opened,  and not in recent years, this place deserves your return business.    Under new management and the original chef, the food is once again really good.  I have enjoyed Pepper Steak and General Tso's Chicken and both were a good portion size, tasty and average price.  I look forward to trying other items on the menu.  Great China does not have a web site so their menu is not yet online.  I just told the friendly lady on the phone what I wanted and she matched it to their menu.
4	Rcbv11hm5AYEwZyqYwAvg	Meeting a friend for lunch, we had a little miscommunication. He went to the wrong one, so I got to see two CFA's for lunch in one day. Like the other, this one was very busy at lunch time. I guess people are thinking that chicken is healthier than the other options in this shopping plaza?  Large seating area, they have a couple of staff wandering around to improve things. The drink lady is a nice touch and she's super friendly. She even refilled the drink I'd brought from the other CFA, though that's probably not the usual deal.  My friend and I took up the table for a good hour and no one troubled us at all!
2	rkRTjhu5szaBggeFVcVJlA	Olive Garden used to be a favorite of the family, recently they cut back the menu extensively and many of our favorites are gone.  I suggest checking the menu online before coming to see what's left.
4	dhmeDsQGUS1FXMLs49SWjQ	This place is rather eclectic for the area it's in (Far West Madison; Middleton?) and really seems out of place. But, that aside their food is quite excellent and the the wait staff are friendly! It's mostly hybrid Mediterranean (Tunisian?) dishes and there are several vegetarian options! Bonus on that. Overall, I'd go back and didn't give it a 5 because the prices are a bit outrageous. C'mon, fellas! We're not in the Upper East Side...
4	z9zfIMYmRRCE4ggfOIieEw	Oh Pupusa, how I love thee.  There's just something about pupusas topped with tomato sauce and curtido. The warm corn masa with the melty goodness inside, paired with the little heat offered from the tomato sauce and the bite of crunchiness &  sour and vinegar from the curtido.  It's the perfect blend of flavors, the perfect bite of soft, to crunchy, to hot and cold all in my mouthful.  This place makes all their stuff fresh, so be sure to not come here when you are on a time constraint.  I don't mind waiting for my food when I know I getting fresh, piping hot goodness.  If you want this for a timed lunch, then it is best to call ahead and pick up your order.   For those that don't know curtido is a picked cabbage slaw. Pupusas are masa stuffed with your filling (bean, cheese, chicharron, squash or whatever your favorite combo). I highly suggest the squash and cheese or chicacharron and cheese).  If you are in need of a good pupusa or looking to try somewhere new this is definitely a must try.   Just a helpful note, I always do better ordering my food when I  bring someone with me that speaks Spanish. I don't know if it is because I look hispanic and people do not believe when I say I don't speak Spanish or what.
2	Xtb3pGSh39bqcozkBECw	I've heard so much about the Waffle House from my husband who was formerly a truck driver, and my friends from the south.  That's it.  No one else raves about it because it's not good.  No offense to my friends with all the melanin, I'm sure if I actually liked waffles or pancakes, I might enjoy this place.  But the idea of liquified sugar on an empty stomach makes me want to gag.  Actually syrup at any time of the day is gross.  And the rest of the food is bland.  Blander than Denny's and way worse than IHOP.  You would think that eggs and hash browns wouldn't be so hard to make, but I've never tasted anything with so little flavor.  That must be why they offer it smothered, covered, etc. because the actual vehicle/food has so little taste that it actually sucks the ability of tasting anything out of your tastebuds.  There are so many decent breakfast joints around, I have no idea why anyone would purposely go here.  Except for the fact that it's in front of the Red Owl and you might be able to go here after you drank way too much and wouldn't know the difference anyways.
2	DOUflAGzxLsXG6xOmR1w	The salad in my sandwich was a great idea.  Lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pepperoncini tossed in balsamic vinegar, oh my, and then piled onto a fresh roll with ham and salami with mayo and mustard.  Not too bad, I must say.  It is, however, too bad the salami was a cheaper kind and not a dry Italian salami.  It kind of made the sandwich a little salty, but doo-able none the less.  I ordered the pasta salad as a side.  I wont make that mistake again.  It's my understanding that pasta salad will be on the acidic side, usually involving vinegar of some kind.  This pasta salad was not acidic at all.  it included cabbage, carrots, sun-flower seeds and a taste that I still cant place.  It looked like it was a "bus-tub" salad.  I took two bites and gave up, no sense in wasting calories.  Overall, I think this place has potential, but my experience was nothing to write home about, sorry mom.  Fortunately for the rest of you . . . . I'm addicted sharing my experiences: be them bad, good or just so-so, lucky you!!
4	0RxCEWURe08CTcZt95F4AQ	Our Las Vegas friend suggested duck tacos after hanging out and having some drinks for a late night/ early morning (around 4am) snack.  All we needed to hear was tacos and we were in.  The small bar area of this place is open 24/7 so we stopped in for some half priced tapas (happy hour from midnight to 8am) and to chat with Dave, our friend's friend and an incredibly cool guy that was working the overnight shift.  It was 4am and I didn't want to be stuffed before going to bed, so I only ordered a few dishes.  I had the steak skewers with teriyaki glaze and the garlic cheese bread.  Both were good, but the garlic cheese bread was really good in its garlicy and cheesy-ness.  I also had one of the duck tacos from one of the others' plates and it was decent, but if I got it again I'd get it without the creamy tomato cilantro sauce.  Overall, I'd say the food is worth 3 or 3.5 stars, but Dave's coolness bumps this location up to a solid 4 stars.
2	MzUg5twEcCyd0X6lBMP2Lg	Okay, so for the most part the food seems edible, however I wouldn't recommend getting the Asian dishes. You don't go to Mexican food place and get a burger, don't go here and get Pad Thai. First of all it was served with a lemon instead of a lime and the eggs were all in one big clump. It was as if I ordered scrambled egg with noodles. I wasn't impressed.  I might go back and try something else . . . if I didn't have any other options.
2	uNlw2D5CYKk0wjNxLtYw	Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.  Not many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating.
4	OtJzdwItIZrDEw7zSsGC9w	The Penguin is a great spot for good cheap eats. I don't get fried pickles but everything else was great. Burgers, fries, good coffee. It gets pretty busy and the service isn't very fast or professional but thats part of the charm. Excellent people watching (NY habit) and an eclectic crowd - blue collar, burners, artists, etc.     The hush puppies are excellent, you need old oil to make them right that's why they are better in the south. Previous bad review said smokey but that's impossible since NC has anti-smoking regulations at least now.
4	OiPjq9laAwR0RrLKzEiBg	I went there again for dinner in a group of 4. We had a group dinner for 4, "Mixed Mazza". It includes: pita --a meager amount. Too dry and too flat. spreads -- hummus, baba ghanouj (good), m'hamara (red pepper spread).  sauces -- yogurt sauce and tahini. appetizers -- falafel, kibbee ball (fried rice + meat), beef sambosia (triangular flaky pastry with beef filling), yalangi (stuffed grape leaves appetizer), olives & pickles. dishes -- Fool (onion & tomato saucy stuff), tabouli, chicken liver, lamb shawarma.   For the price of $57, I think it is pretty worthwhile. Every dish is good but I wish the pita was up to par with the dishes. They could have provided more pita, too.  Hot tea that is complimentary from the house. Similar as before, there was only 1 waiter bustling. Poor guy. I'd like my tea to be refilled a lot more frequently though.
4	Ear2u56nOFhoXpkFc7cAg	This is the best chinese food that I have found in Charlotte so far. It meets the standard of the Chinese food up North.  Of course many places in New York still have them beat but they hold their own here.  Their food is fresh, hot and tastes like good quality Chinese take out.
2	AMxo2frXTlaOqRLstWZOw	BEST of @stationcasinos Buffets @RedRockLV   still boring & bland. Nice decor but it always falls short!  Service was ok this time but a lot of dried up uninviting crap on the buffet.  For $18.88 pp I expect better. Next time Cabo's lesson learned!!:(
2	HqtEtHHDgSM0ctJHehaWaw	I've never been a big fan of BK, I have held pretty true to my Micky Ds however the chicken fries with multiple dipping sauce options are a great snack.  They are always advertising apple fries for the kids but this location never seems to have any in stock.
2	MS4cwENw3pybvd2EbnPc5w	We went there for my daughter's B-Day dinner. The food took forever, I mean forever. It's 8:00 on a Tuesday and there were not alot of people  there, so why the long wait? Who knows? I asked if they sang or gave the b-day person a dessert...the waitress said they don't do anthing but that she will do something. I thought that was nice of her. However, she hardly came around,not even to refill our drinks, and even took forever to give us our check!! The inside and outside was cool-What was up in the bathroom? On all the sinks were hairspray,lotion,towels, deodorant - it looked like a bathroom from an all girls dorm room in college. Oh yeah and there were two ladies just hanging out like they were bathroom attendants or something... The food was alright, nothing special...The house made potato chips topped with cheese and balsamic vinegar was good but came cold. I will give this place another chance one day I guess, I'm not in a hurry though...
2	PFmocUOXp92QWVDaFA	Been here a few times, Decent selections and food is ok. Girls are attractive but man service is not up to par. Took forever to even get served and we were a group of 12 with a not so busy atmosphere at the time. Not really welcoming, but oh well.
2	Wi9nelif4zOl3Vux2tvyXw	I'm a PTS whore. In my opinion, this Sierra Gold rubs me the wrong way. I just don't like the vibe here. There is nothing wrong with the service. The architect was probably smoking weed while designing this place.
2	YHbdCgGuNCKgKFfPawh4MQ	Let me start off by saying, I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.  I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.  Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu "cheeseburger" but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom, lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.    As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness, I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds, the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family, I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.  The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them, they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.  Overall, I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.  Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident.
4	zXIEOzL4NsyFzn5dbZudkQ	I have heard about Broadway Pizzeria for years know from new yorkers. I was in the area so we decided to get a pizza to go. We got a cheese pizza and it was great!!! The place was packed and it was only about 4pm. The staff was very friendly. As i recently became vegetarian and trying to become a vegan i will return about one more time as i am not going to eat dairy anymore. I sure wish i started to go there years ago, as everything looked great. My three year old who is not a big eater ate two giant slices. What more can you say considering most pizza she eats she will only take a couple of bites. I am originally from the philly-new york area and it does rank up to the good pizza places back there.
4	kWHCkWRa4uwNAC2pwcwg	One of the old stand bys in Madtown.  Whether you're looking for a nice meal that doesn't cost a lot or you want to go with some friends for drinks Amy fits both needs.  The salad/soup/baguette combo is something I've eaten 100 times in my life.  Sometimes twice in one day.  The soups, which rotate daily, are all good.  My favorite was the cheesey brocoli.  You gotta get eat veggies in college somehow.  The spicy fried and chicken sandwich also makes a fine meal.  Wash it down with a pint of something off the tap.  No attitude and not too sceney just a good old place for drinks and grub.
2	xOPovcA4LBXS9JbupGObCQ	I guess I should have read the reviews before I took the family for a quick dinner meal here.   Ordered an original chicken piece kids meal and a chicken strip kids meal for my two girls. Specifically asked if the meals had to come with the apple sauce pouch since we don't allow our children to eat from pouches after the whole larva incident. He stated no. You can get an additional side. Great. We ordered two additional sides. We then ordered myself and my husband a meal.   Upon receipt of our order we received two chicken strip meals WITH apple sauce. Great. We didn't receive the original chicken piece meal and we got apple sauce instead of another side for which they then said you get a cookie, a HARD STALE COOKIE at that instead of the apple sauce. Fine. We took the cookie to throw away later. Aside from my girls food, mine and my husband's food wasn't too bad I guess.   Only foul part was later I go back up to the counter, wait 3-4 minutes while the front counter cashier AND the drive thru cashier eat their meals on the line. Yes, the same line they serve our food out of. One of the guys stuffs his last bite into his mouth and walks to the counter and I ask him for ranch sauce. I guess there wasn't any under the front counter because he then walks toward the back counter to look and the original counter cashier says in Spanish, "Dayum, is the B*tch gonna ask for anything else?!" I guess Spanish speaking Belizean trumps him because I understood every word he said. Needless to say we won't be going back.
4	gjWVccNw6kB2UycZAEzyQg	I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesn't matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, you'll pay the price...
4	JemvAfRVgCASkI3uG3Vffg	Been here several times. Hasn't let me down yet. It's easily accessible off Boulder Highway and is open 24/7. This is one of my preferred spots to redeem the BOGO coupon for the Double Del Cheeseburger, $3.00 each, and I don't recall having any issues. They also aren't upselling jerks who pester you about trying a new item or asking 3 times whether you're sure that you've concluded your order.
4	r1HxaW8hCo1FE9wrkchTg	This is a fun place, a little loud but that's the ambience they're shooting for. The food was actually very good and the portions were generous. A plus for me is a dedicated gluten free menu. The salmon was great and I'm told by others in my party, the fish and chips were good also. I tried crawfish for the first time, they actually had experts who come to the table to explain and demonstrate how to remove the meat from the little buggers. The meat had a nice flavor but I left the head sucking for someone else. All in all a pleasant experience.
2	4kkI0UXYIHKxuJb5uo5WYg	So the last couple times I have eaten at Joe's within the last 6 months or so I have been sorely dissapointed.  It used to be my husband's and I's favorite pizza spot around and we went there all the time.  They must have changed ingredients or lowered the quality of them, as their pizza is just not as good as it used to be.  Just regular old mediocre pizza now.
2	XPT5TeBby2ehdpyDLVVu0w	ick. i wanted regular bbq wings with regular bbq sauce and they put hot sauce in the bbq. the vinegar  on hot wings gives me a headache so i can only eat bbq. she kept trying to tell me that i wanted them medium heat.. i dunno.. not going there again i dont think.. at least not to eat
2	oFCYz6HmRqQxrERVC2bn7A	My husband and I ate here for breakfast while downtown on Memorial Day weekend. The food is decent but nothing special. I do appreciate the fact that they had some healthy options on their menu. My husband is more of a steak and eggs type and so he was disappointed by the lack of heartier meals. Both of us thought the service was absolutely horrible. I thought they were just very understaffed that day but my husband had been there on a weekday morning when they were slow and said that it was the same bad service.   All in all, I would not eat there if I had a choice but it is really the only breakfast option downtown besides Matt's which is always a ridiculously long wait.
4	gNiEcoEDgLiQ2XJLqnOFrw	Went with friends before a movie. It's tough to get a seat many nights, but the staff is friendly and we can usually wait at the bar. Our waiter this night was a little more forthright about the wines on the list that he did not like - but he was right. Great pizza and pasta. Best simple pasta dishes for the price anywhere in town. Most dinners around $10. It's a great deal.
4	iwIos1vaQ8d7cWM3X8RZcw	I saw the commercial and thought i would give the $5 box a try. I went at 530pm tonight and took it to go. It was busy because obviously the $5 box is the attraction. I got the breast and drum spicy and my sides were beans and rice and mashed potato (out of cole slaw :( )...biscuit included. I will be honest in saying the drumstick was far more juicy than the breast but was crispy and zesty. The biscuit was fluffy. The beans and rice were well seasoned with a hint of smoky salted pork. You also have the option of having 3 tenders instead of 2 piece. They were very busy both drive thru and walk in. No one was rude but they were VERY busy. After my experience at the glendale location i was hesitant but i do not regret spending $5 on a meal after a full shift at work. The place was clean: floors tables windows and counters. Napkin station and tea station were stocked.  If people had a negative experience before those staff must be gone. There is a sign in the window that says now hiring for ALL locations.
2	IPPY3JMCtT33YVnn4vzg	Ive been here on multiple occasions and I have never been fully satisfied. The wait staff is poor. On one visit, two other couples had been seated and received their drinks before we even saw our waitress. Another time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and still waited 10 minutes before we saw our waitress to ask for the check.   The food: It comes out fast which is kind of scary. It makes me think that they are just popping in the microwave. I watch a lot of kitchen nightmares :-p  The chips and dip served when you arrive is more filling than the food to be honest.   I liked the margaritas...Good pricing!  Finally the best part: The chocolate mini chimis.
2	pe11Rpin6Zto2RlGdZI2g	Hit BK for late lunch with the gf.  just another non-descript chinese restaurant on spring mtn.  as you walk in you see the ducks hanging by the neck under the heat lamp and some pre-made cafeteria style dishes that according to the gf , are appetizer and "to-go" food - one of the items she sees that gets her fired up - chili-infused pork stomach - yummy ?!?!  we order the pork stomach dish, a beef noodle dish, some chinese greens and "chinese"bbq Chicken.  after we order the food is on the table in geez, 3 minutes ?  that actually bothers me - i don't care how hot the wok is in the kitchen, too much of the ingredients must be pre cooked, pre-everything to get the grub to us so quickly.  the beef noodles - boring very, boring and the beef has the smell of  the 1/2 price selections at  the supermarket - not too fresh.  also too much oil used in cooking the dish.  the greens - nothing special.  the bbq chicken - i don't get it.  it was apparently "bbq'd" then flash fried in the wok - the bone to met ratio way too high, decent flavor thoiugh.  the pork stomach - it includes a small l]pile of the  bbq duck - the duck had no seasoning to it, nothing to it.  the pork stomach - reminds me of calamari in texture - some pieces very tender, others, very chewy - but some nice kick from the chili - an ok dish.  total cost w/ tea and rice $33.50
4	NvJajdzohHyEhMBzfzpJMw	I enjoyed my visit to Asadero Toro.  The decor is minimalist, folding chairs and tables in an old Wendy's and a small bar with salsas and pickled vegetables on ice.  You gotta get carne asada at an asadero, I thought, and it was a good choice.  It comes served on a plastic tray much like you'd find at a school cafeteria, I felt special though as the other patrons got styrofoam plates :)  The food was delicious, solid tortillas, and they even gave me a char-grilled onion quarter.
2	Mkptp6T0QPt3g85UYuJA	Nothing against this applebees particularly. The company as a whole has gone to hell. They've gotten rid of all their good beers, appetizers and entres. The boneless wings kept going up in price, the beer went up with less selection, thai chicken pizza GONE, jalapeno poppers GONE, onion peels GONE. It's like the people running the company are completely backwards. As a result I have not been back in over a year. Other places have more beer, better prices, and better food. No reason to go back to applebees.
4	eRIxO4qj4dOLbYYEi2Lgkg	I cannot give it 5 stars because the service isn't always amazing and the wait can be pretty long. But definitely 4 stars worthy because of the delicious garlic bread they start you off with. They have a decent wine and beer list. The salads are good, even better if you add chicken or salmon! I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't worth trying. They do have some great Specials daily. The halibut cheeks are quite a fav! But I do wish they had more of a routine schedule because they have a great broccoli cheese soup (try it if its on that night). Enjoy your meal, just don't fill up on garlic bread!
2	NzQAxxtPLKxrzdfNsNPbcQ	Horrible music and very in-conducive to eating! Bad for digestion. We had that "rushed" feeling due to the music and I actually wanted to finish my meal as soon as possible so we could get out of there.
4	XZXxnDzC4W8p0itQTOGA	Bruegger's is Bruegger's, there no attempt at a high end faccade here.  Their staff is friendly and will know you by name if you become a regular.  The food is always good quality and on par with their pricing.  Their coffee is good and a great value as are their combos.  Hint:  on a pinch for lunch?  For a 'healthier' alternative try they whole wheat bagel & egg sandwhich loaded up with veggies.
4	5O2zENU16a41zgTpgvuYrg	First I must say the service was tops! The waiter was soooo experienced, personable and funny. Food was solid and consistent across the board. Prices were fair according to Scottsdale standards. Overall we would definitely go back again.
4	QcS7p8dGmOxAsPd3K5FnQ	A coworker recommended this place and I'm glad she did. This place offers solid, delicious take out.  I've tried their meatball sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, and calzones. The only disappointments I've had were: no sandwich rolls one night and poor quality chicken on the sandwich. However, it was still delicious.  I can't speak of the actual restaurant (apparently it's full of hunky dudes?), but I've had great experiences with Brioni To Go. Great Italian grub in the desert.
4	9xizfHBru571CnJ5MNCRA	On Tuesdays you can spend a petty sum*  and have pokey sticks for practically every meal until the weekend.  Four stars to that.  *I think it's still buy one size pokey sticks get the next one for 99 cents.
2	zlb4jug6LFygvZmhxmIGYg	If you like boneless wings with a million sauce options this is a Buffalo Wild Wings alternative for you.  The husband and i decided to try out Hurricane's a few weeks ago and meh is all I can really say. My husband appreciated the fact that they were able to make a proper buffalo chicken sandwich (chicken breast is completely tossed in wing sauce) but I was left questioning whether or not the chicken in their chicken chili was really chicken- or pressed chicken pieces with chicken flavoring. The service was ok but like the food, nothing to write home about.  If dragged here again I would probably go with the intention to drink- not eat.
4	AQ9Rvu4VptNY5s3PSMOJw	There needs to be more BYOB's in Pittsburgh, just saying! There is something about going out for a long dinner with friends and finishing (3 big) bottles of wine that warms my antioxidant rich heart!   I have tried to go here a couple times before but couldn't get a reservation.  There are soo many quaint restaurants like this in Philly and I miss them in the burgh (there is even an interactive BYOB map with the closest liquor stores listed).   I went with a man-friend, and the waiter (Matt) was really patient with us because we were taking forever to order.  The menu was interesting but not too over the top so simple palettes aren't overwhelmed.   Friendly, Cute, French, Cozy. Perfect.   We started which the spinach dip. Delish. I ordered the scallops which was a smaller portion but hit the spot! My friend ordered the salmon which was also delicious. I had a bite of that and I might get that next time!   I am going to be honest, We might have drank a huge bottle of wine during the meal and stayed to close.  We left smiling (with purple stained teeth) and full.   Pro: Cozy, Outdoor seating (although it was closed), BYOB! BYOB! Delicious food, friendly service, good noise level, BYOB, open kitchen  Con: Can be tough to get a res (but thats because its awesome), limited indoor seating, stem charge, cash only  Overall: Check it out! Great date spot!
2	AGuqCk2qmwAEH91CBiCkWg	Hom and its many levels are just trying way to be hard to be cool. I was there for a party (and a private VIP thing beforehand) and I was just kind of overwhelmed by how over the top the place is. It confirmed my suspicions. I was in what's called the Bubble Room for much of the time. It was like a creepy dungeon basement with animal heads on the wall. Gross. The Bubble Room is their champagne room and can be rented out. I don't see why anyone would want to hang out in that weird space though.
4	sgT9K9IAcH8X8xJgSypuvA	Great place for affordable dining. Now, just to clarify, the food is super good, but the ambiance is so so... and you are in Little Asiatown, too.  The wait staff is super nice. So, if you are looking for super good food and affordable prices than Dong-A. Still have to giggle at the name.  If you are looking to impress a date or friends from out of town, than Dong-A!!! No need to be shallow with your relationships right? IF you have to be pretentious for others than who are you really?
4	wdnJjV63trYgSh55DASlw	I am rarely voluntarily away from Vegas for long. Sure there are those times that the state wishes I occupy one of their rooms for 3 to 6 years, but we have all had those times.    I came back for my birthday and I visited many of my old haunts. I was longing for nostalgia. I was longing for strong drink. I was longing for weak companionship. I hit many of my favorite places...and the Tap House was one of them.  I longed to play shuffleboard, drink beers and listen to good music. When I am near Summerlin there is only one place I go to. So I swung into the bar around midnight and spend the rest of the night throwing back drinks with friends.   The pizza was half price and that was just right for us. We tried three of the pizzas and they were amazing. I also had to order my favorite Chicken Parmigiana. It was as wonderful as usual.   Right next door used to be a Las Vegas institution called Fellini's.  They have since moved their restaurant to the Sun Coast Casino to ply their trade. The good news is that they still deliver their freshly made sauces and they are amazing as always.  So you basically get to eat the same food for half the price and get reasonable priced drinks.  The bartender knew it was my birthday and comped me drinks and was totally cool. He treated Rex like the way Rex demands to be treated. It is important to treat Rex well...and he knew that. He could see it in the eyes.  I want to address the smoking issue one person brought up...and I will say...grow up!  People smoke in bars...but very rarely do they get to smoke in a place with a great shuffleboard table and amazing food.  I have removed one star because they have a crappy jukebox that plays edited songs. Ridiculous. Good music on there but not all the songs you would want.   Go. Go often. Drink. Drink to Rex. You always should.

We always used to take visitors here and they used to rave about it as much as did.  If i was writing this review back then, I would have easily given it 5 stars.    As for the service, we have always been treated kindly there.  The waiters are always soft spoken and very friendly.  I don't have much to say about the place itself - its not new, but its not dirty or anything.  The prices were also reasonable for what you get.  (And here's the but....) -  But the past couple times we've been, the food quality has changed.  We always get the same thing - the beef satay dinner and pad thai.  Last couple times we went, the meat was bland and missing all the flavor!  It didn't taste like they marinated it at all!  The shrimp in the fried rice was undercooked - we had to send it back.  The pad thai was way too saucy for my liking - it reminded me of the instant pad thai that you can make at home.  The quality of the food has just changed.  Maybe they got a different cook - I'm not sure.  All I know is that its just not what it used to be.  Unfortunately, after two bad experiences in a row, we're going to have to skip Thai BBQ from now on.
2	FfwKNl6dDkql7zNs4t6AfQ	Went this morning for a brunch.  Table ordered the regular omelette (ham and cheddar), french toast and sides of hash browns, bacon and fresh fruit.  Omelette, hash browns and french toast were all tasty.  The bacon "side" was two small, thin strips and the fresh fruit was ordinary.  I'd give the food three stars but with prices at about $9 each for the breakfast entrees, I'm knocking a star off for value.  We choose Harper's because we could make a reservation and my friend needed to catch a plane so we couldn't wait for a table at any other place.  But unless I'm in a similar time crunch, I'm unlikely to choose Harper's again for a Sunday brunch.  I have enjoyed lunch at Harper's previously and would do that again without hesitation.
2	qcYVoRfS5bCJ7WPeDalKg	I really wanted to love this place.  When my husband and I met the owner, we were delighted and couldn't wait to try out their brunch.  However, when we came there to dine, the nice owner wasn't there and our waiter was horrible.  He didn't give us a menu until 20 minutes after we were seated and was grumpy and rude.  I think he was probably hung over.  The food was forgettable, but the bad service wasn't!
2	orQc1Pf45m4yqvelSNb7Q	so i've been verrrrrry skeptical about getting sushi since moving down here, but the other week my boy and i ventured out to get takeout from sushi kame. i still believe this was a big mistake.  i opted to stay fish-free and get the avocado maki, sweet potato maki, edamame and miso soup. the rolls were okay, on the smaller side and not really anything to write about...on the other hand, i don't know if it's because we got takeout, but our portion of edamame was ridiculously small! i'm talking like the container was 1/3 full, and not salted at all. at all! who eats edamame without some salt?!?! geez. and the miso soup was funky...i had one spoonful and that was enough. i still can't put my finger on why it tasted so bad, but i will for sure never ever get that again at sushi kame. come to think about it, i won't ever get anything again from sushi kame because i won't be going back. the boy decided to play it safe as well and simply ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box. he said the panko crust on the tempura was delightful, and that the chicken teriyaki was cooked well and had some flavor, but he threw away the salad and california roll after opening each container. why? the lettuce in the salad was wilted and should have been tossed out weeks before, and he said the california roll looked completely inedible (i didn't get a glance at it).  since he has never simply just tossed out any food by the looks of it (my boy likes to eat!), i took his word for it. so yeah, sushi kame? no thank you. i'll keep looking for a decent sushi place around these parts and hopefully i'll be satisfied soon....
4	Pqnr1S7PXoUqSuGqJqYDlA	A cool 96 degree summer evening in Tempe, 3 delicious ice cold brews and average bar grub made for a splendid way to spend a Saturday night with friends.  If I went to college at ASU I know I would have been a regular at this place.  I love how many places there are to sit outside and I love the lighting.  I can imagine day drinking would be glorious here although I have yet to experience it.  I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and it was great but for some reason the spinach was not cold...maybe that 96 and balmy had something to do with it.  My boyfriend had the burger and my best friend enjoyed her seafood sandwich.  The star of the table was the chocolate cake which I sadly bailed on.  The ambiance makes the place and when in the area, I am sure to return for a casual evening with friends in the future
2	0HopjwSWGVfXeOw5Agadmg	I'm eating what could be a baked potato, but it may be a slab of leather...I'm not quite sure.    My BLT salad was supposed to be grilled chicken with a balsamic vinaigrette, but it's Italian dressing with fried chicken...hmm  at least the girl upfront was nice...
4	oGB8OmAp0SWSmycxhA4NQ	I had a coupon so I figured why not. I ordered an ultimate cheeseburger and it tasted REALLY good. Just the right amount of condiments.   The rootbeer is just always better at jack in the box for some strange reason. At 1 dollar for any size soft drink...why yes I would like a large, thank you.  The order was completed quickly and accurately despite the fact that they were busy. Its located in a weird spot, but if your on the move you can gas up and get a burger then hit the road.
4	eHH28w3VfhM9GNUjgrzrgg	This is just a basic (albeit mini) chain greasy spoon. I had a decent burger with guac and soda. I would give three stars, except for a) good service and b) relatively low prices. I'd probably return if hungry nearby and a Costco meal was not appropriate.
2	G1Yl5jXMA3SI4AAMlYD9rw	SERVICE: So I was staying at the hotel and I called in to order for pick up. The guy said hold on and said "Can we take orders for pick up? She is trying to avoid room service." Wow... just wow. This hotel is in a great location in the middle of the action in Tempe on Mill St. If I cannot order as a hotel guest for pick up then I would rather go pick up next door on Mill St where there are so many restaurants! Sheesh. Get a clue, dude. You have lots of competition being on Mill St and you are questioning whether I can order or not?  If the conference didn't give me a hotel credit I would DEFININTELY NOT be giving you my business because of that. How does he know I'm trying to avoid room service anyways... Wow. When I went to pick up there was not a single person in the restaurant! It was an odd hour though at around 1500. Again, wow...  I just had to get that off my chest... now onto the food....   FOOD: It's mostly bar type food but they also do have other more expensive entrees too.  1. Kobe Burger with provolone on a pretzel bun ($11) - choice of cheese and choice of side. I picked the fruit bowl which included fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, honey dew. Burger patty was huge! The food was actually really good. I enjoyed it but I couldn't swallow the service.  PRICES: Average. CONCLUSION: I will likely avoid this place if I can since I will be criticized for not getting room service. My room is right by the restaurant so of course I'm going to walk! The burger was good but wasn't that good to tolerate that kind of service. Obviously the only reason they got stars is because of the food. Luckily, the hotel does have 2 other restaurant called Cabana Bar and Grill by the pool and Mission Grille. Hopefully the same people do not work at the other restaurants.
2	pCeYha3SCm6dDrWrpuqZQ	Much like Elanor M., me and my friends were drawn into Tigerlily by the promise of sitting out in the sun drinking expensive, but pleasing drinks on George Street.   Inside however, we were greeted by a huge queue of people who had obviously had the smae idea - but who werent getting served by the staff behind the bar, or so it seemed as the queue was moving so slowly. At least that time gave me chance to look around the place - its kind of funky and traditional at the same time, but gives off the impression that it is trying so hard to make you think its not trying at all. Much like the clientel, who have spent hour on thier hair, make up and clothes to make you think they have spent no time at all on thier hair, make up and clothes.   Anyway, once we got our drink (about 6 1/2 years later), I nearly chocked as I paid for my round. Evenm though we sat in the sun drinking them, a cloud certainly hung over our table.
4	qsGzcJoYXfs8dloXKcY27w	We went there last night.  The line was long so we waited a few minutes before paying the cashier. Me and wife paid a total of $15 for the buffet and 2 drinks.  The server was friendly, the food was good.  My favorite is the lemon chicken.  All and all I will come back.
2	HPzDaSpqImBNFqrQnzHTA	The boneless wings were good but bad value. $5 for 5 wings. I can get some spicy nuggets at Wendy's for a $1 and they would be almost better than what I had at hungry howies. They should rethink their pricing.
4	Tt2wr1JUsU5XpUKNXCXzg	Ok, I am not sure why people put down the Stratosphere, yea...yea the casino action kind of sucks....but don't go there to gamble, go there for Lucky's and Fat Tuesday's....But let's get back to Lucky's....we were here with a couple that had never been to the Strat, so we decided to go before having dinner, my honey and I decided to play some penny slot to kill time, and LO and BEHOLD...I saw a sign advertising steak and crab legs for 9.99, well, most people (NOT ME) would be scared off by that, but hell it was a hard night, I lost some moola and was looking for some cheap (but good) grub....I am after all a foodie...haha, only if you count greasy spoons. Anyways, back to Lucky's the dinner was really good, the steak was juicy, the crab legs meaty, tender and were already cut in half for you....shoot people, what more do you want, what more do you need.....Oh, but wait there's a catch, you can only order that between 7p-10p or 6-10, I forgot, but I do know it ends at 10p. Try to catch it, if you are cheap like me. A damn good, dinner, though, damn!
2	nX5vLM62gnpHwRc66RAk3w	Went to NN's today for lunch, ordered the Adelaide 6" with "thinnest crust possible," aka "Skinny Minnie." Had a $10 coupon from Radio Shopping Show, which, all told, took me to about $2.60 out of pocket. Not bad for a pizza made to order. The 'za was tasty, garlic was definitely present. Crust looked like it was made elsewhere and shipped in frozen. Yes, frozen-disc crust. But for pocket change, no complaints. The 6" was definitely enough for a 1-person lunch.  When I concluded my meal, I turned to thank the hostess but she and the cook were nowhere to be found. I literally was alone in the joint. Me and the white bucket of bleach and a rag soaking in it, located next to the drink fountain. That was all kinds of gross and disgusting.   Overall, probably won't be back. I've had much better pizza, better service and no cleaning supplies on public view, in other pizza restos around town. Taste of Chicago is great, Rocco's is great. This place? Won't be around a year from now. I bet you a 6" Adelaide.
2	SeKXTzndnk1PPyrZ8sEXw	I've been here on three separate occasions.  The first time I visited, the place was absolutely marginal.  As I was eating I'm thinking to myself, "Yes, I'm eating a burrito...but I don't know why it doesn't taste as good as, say, Taco Bell."  The second and third visits to this place were work related, and I wasn't the one driving or deciding on lunch, so I didn't have much choice.  And I kept thinking the same thing that I thought on the first visit: Why isn't this as good as Taco Bell?    If I give a place one star, that means I'll pretty much have to be dragged unconscious to the establishment in order for me to step back inside.  Yes, I do think Taco Bell is better than this place (especially when it comes to price), but I'm not going to throw a fit if somebody else is footing the bill.
4	jCQIsQBnt19jjKiinZMmTQ	It's nitty, it's gritty, the food is AWESOME and the clientile & staff is straight hood! It's in the middle of the REAL south side of Phoenix right off of Central & Baseline. It's crazy awesome. At first glance ifs pretty colorful and kind of cool, if it were wiped down with rags dampened with clorox! LOL!   This is TOTALLY my kind of place!! Its straight hood! It's in a strip mall and is between a Chinese food place and a day labor place. It's kind of crazy there. If you're dining after dark I FULLY recommend ordering things to go because there's been shootings there before. Two that I know of, but YO she shouldn't have looked at her like that! GAH! JK!   There are a few retro video games there and a couple of pool tables and there's also a bar in the back! (yay!!) but the bar scene isn't that great. But the booze is cheap! (double yay!)  Like all Long Wongs, this place is known for their hot wings which are made fast, cheap & delicious! their suicide wings are the owner's pride and joy and trust me... they're HOTT!! I once downed an entire pitcher of Margaritas while scarfing on a dozen trying to win a bet. And at the end of the night, I prevailed while holding my head up HIGH before I crashed down to the floor cuz I was trashed!   They have the usual greasy spoon food and it's all at fair prices. They also have bbq and solid dinners. Like speghetti or steak dinners. I'm a huge fan of their fried zucchini.   This place is very rough around the edges but it's still the small neighboor place that it was intended to be. Where those in know which side of the menu to order from. Where drunks get trashed in the back room bar. Where hustlers get gullable rez girls (like me) to bet them $20 a ball at some 8ball. where sometimes fights break out - but it's not a terrible thing. I don't know how to explain it... Its home. It's rough, it's the hood but the people are real. There is NO pretention in this place. It's straight up good food at straight up good prices. You can have a great time here - I have had many... just keep an eye on your purse.
4	9rGCzoB2R9ypcxd3sOWVw	Yes Dairy Queen ,an American Favorite. Everyone loves DQ!  Though over the years the lce Cream has changed, but what has not. It is a cheap place to go , to get some old time fav's! The Dilly bars and Buster Bars are still around and still pretty good. Though I would like a little more fudge on it. The place is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. So very much worth a stop in.
4	PDXHVsj0HpKW0FrPxv9X4Q	If you've read Ryan G's Yelp! about this place, that about sums it up. I'd like to build on that.   First of all, the food here is pretty good. I've had the burritos, tacos, asada fries, carne asada plate, and probably other things I don't recall. Most of the time, I end up there mid-week and get the "Taco Special": you get four tacos, a drink, some chips and beans for 6.50! It's a pretty good deal, and it fills me up pretty good. I also sometimes get the Super Burrito, which is pretty good, too. The food, overall, is good. (It's good, but not as good as Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo)  The place is kinda rundown and isn't in the best part of town. There are definitely some characters there at times, but it's never a situation where I feel "Oh, crap, I'm gonna get beat up." The actual restaurant seems like it's slowly being upgraded (new LCD tv's), but that may just be a false impression.   I've gone to Pepe's Tacos a billion times, mostly late at night, and it's usually got a number of people. Whether that's a testament to the food, value, or the fact that it's open 24 hours... I don't know... or probably all three.  Go to Pepe's, get some food, then let me know how you feel about it.
2	8VgrUvvj6dAZ9PLwUPsHAw	Came in at 1015 they served me lunch even though it didn't start until 1030. However the bathrooms were disgusting, an employee walked out after using the restroom and did nothing about it knowing it was dirty.
4	pUX9YXHyZh8rzaYtuQ7tVQ	I use to think that Honeybaked Ham only sold Ham products so I never bothered because I dont eat beef or pork. When I found out they sell turkey products I was so happy. I actually got a sample when they had a booth in Ballantyne. I take my son here often and they know us. I went alone one day and couldnt remember exactly what he usually gets and the lady says I know what he gets LOL that was pretty awesome on top of the fact that they pile the meat on the sandwich and the slices are thick! They are not cheap and its awesome! Definitely a thumbs up, matter fact Im do for a sandwich soon LOL
2	pwbagO112bPBkWsp2QRqg	I usually love Wendy's but i have had an encounter with the manager and he was straight up rude. And today I went around 950 am to get some food and according to their website Wendy's open at 7 am and I sat in the drive thru for 5 min and no one said that they were closed or asked me if I want anything. There was 4 cars parked out front so I am sure there were people in side. Now i called later in the day to get clarification on when they open, and the phone rang for 2 min... At 130 in the afternoon. I am very disappointed.
4	RTEpdt9YEA64g7qe1FMGSg	I really like the grilled cheese with the green chilies. Great bar food but you WILL smell like fish fry when you leave so not great for a date night unless you are already in that comfortable stage. Oh and the corned beef is stellar too.
4	bXfEWJlxol5sHtH3UuTQ	La pi\u00f1ata and I go back 20+ years. I was faster and leaner and dark family Mexican places with great Sonoran food and Frozen Margaritas with freshly fried chips and chunky salsa was just the ticket on the west side. I'm older and not so lean anymore and so is La Pi\u00f1ata. They still have good "gringo" food and I still like it. It's hard to say whether La Pi\u00f1ata and I are worn out or just comfortable, but I'm going to keep coming
2	O1XRHpdG7yUEeLtzcyCZcA	We have visited Native for the last time... the food has gotten worse in the 2 years I have lived here and the pizza...  not gonna happen to me again.  The wings are just OK but not worth the effort to go back when you can get them everywhere here.   Fuggetbouit Native NY'er we are moving on.
4	Ndd2bxkAC2zgBwQs2T08A	Great stuffed pizza, so good, you may cry tears of joy.  Service is AOK.  The atmosphere is nice, 99% of the time.  I say this because the last time we went we sat at an indoor table close to the bar area.  About half way into our meal a homeless man walked in and started screaming at the owner, who happened to be sitting at the bar by himself eating a salad.    He immediately got up and went behind the bar.  The homeless man sat down at the bar and began eating fistfuls of the salad and smearing his messy hands all over the bar top.  The owner quietly asked him to leave several times, but this guy was on a mission.  A mission to spread the word that the owner of Gino's had gone "shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota!!!!!"  He screamed it over and over again, and when the owner dude grabbed homeless dudes arm in an effort to usher him out the door things escalated.  The homeless guy screamed, "don't touch me man!!  You been shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota!!!"  This must mean that shopping at Macy's in Minnesota has big time cooties, but I don't know for sure.  That's when the owner informed him that he was going to call the police.  With that homeless man came over to our table, and without saying a word, leaned over dangerously close to our beloved pizza pie and stared omniously at it.  (He may have been receiving an intergalactic message.)  My dining partner and myself sat there silently shocked like we were watching a movie we weren't a part of.    Moments later I heard the owner say, "please don't bother my customers."  To my surprise, homeless man decided not to help himself to our pizza, and cut short his transmission to the mother ship.  He instead headed back out to the bar area.  Just then a thoroughly bored looking copper showed up and escorted homeless man out.    My dining companion looked at me and said, "I told you we shouldn't have sat up front".    The food here is awesome.  Just don't sit up front, unless you be shoppin' at Macy's in Minnesota YO!!
2	RW7ymWqzpkON4SnNFHSAw	Not entirely sure how a place like this can survive, even on a college campus. They literally take anything that can be deep-fried, put it in a sandwich and then cover it in greasy french fries. I had what I thought was one of the healthier sandwiches, the Fat Luigi. It was a meatball sub with marinara, mozzarella sticks and fries. The upside, beer is cheap. $1.50 for a 312 bottle. Very surprised about that. And $1.25 for can of bud light. They actually ask for tips, which is strange and uncomfortable. Meh.  Probably won't go here again.
2	3NqYNudoidsaxKhQxmJpJA	We stopped in here before my pilgrimage to the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Walking in, I was immediately taken by the smell of smoke. Living in Los Angeles, I'm not used to walking into public places and smelling that.  It wasn't overpowering, just unexpected.  Right when you enter, there is a large rectangular bar with video gaming built into the bar.  To the right is the dining area.  Think Elk's Lodge style chairs and veneered tables that have been wiped down so many times that the wood finish is turning white.    Jeff ordered the sliders and I got the taco basket.  Jeff's sliders came with 4 small burgers and a mountain of fresh and hot french fries.  Under the fries there was a buried pickle.   The small buns were actually kinda fancy. They had been grilled and the burger meat wasn't dry.  There were some delicious grilled onions on the burgers, too.  It was a huge meal, despite being an appetizer special.  I got taco basket.  Three ground beef tacos.  There was a bit of lettuce, a bit of tomato and a pound of cheese.  I was in heaven with the cheese.  I dumped the lettuce, tomatoes and ate them with the cheese.  There was a small container of salsa, but it really had no flavor.  The tacos were actually smaller than I had expected, but they were tasty and not greasy.    The food was much better than I had anticipated.  It was reasonably priced, too.  Our server was obviously tired.  We went in during the early afternoon, after the lunch rush, on a Saturday.  I think the poor thing was just beat.  When she was around, she was great, but it was hard to find her.  We almost left because no one came to take our order for several minutes.    I would give this place 3 stars for the food, but the darkness, the smoke and the slower service brings it down to a 2.  However, the next time that I am the Pinball Hall of Fame, I might consider getting something to eat here.
4	l52vf2hq0H1T9pLGBuiqQ	Q: Where do all the hipster-vegans go when they get fed up with Quiet Storm's brunch? A: Zenith  The food was good, all vegetarian, the coffee was pretty okay for a breakfast joint. The wait wasn't extremely long and the hostess was nice enough to ask us beforehand if we minded being sat with other people and/or children neither of which bothered us. It's a family set-up, so it's more like a huge dining room with a big buffet table than anything else. I can understand the appeal of this sort of place, but in the end it's just not for me. A little too much noise for my mornings. If you can deal with that many people talking that early in the morning, then this place is for you. Also, now that I think about it, this may be the only thing I've enjoyed in the South Side.
2	hUPkxsTf9wsjAeng9upgQ	Food was just ok...and I might just be very picky when it comes to BBQ.  I might try it one more time...but as of right now...I'll probably not bother.  Also...they are using part of the dining area as an office.  a very messy/cluttered office.  Sends me the idea that they might not be that organized in the kitchen?
4	rlff8Vm5FEiOGinkzwWYg	This food was so good, I'm not even mad that Persia no longer exists. Persian Garden Cafe is enough for me.   First off, there's plenty of meat and seafood on the menu - but - everything can be made vegan. That's right. You can all come out of hiding now. You're safe here.  I shared the dolmeh and falafel plate with a friend and was satisfied, but still found room for dessert. Yeah, I've got my priorities straight. It came with four big, crisp, spiced falafel and three FRESH, steamed domlehs. (To anyone who has only had the displeasure of trying a canned dolmeh: now is your time. Feed.) That may appear to be enough to serve one person, but with the heaps of saffron rice, brown lentil-currant-other-tasty-things rice, tahini, tomatoes, and huge basket of flat bread it came with, it was more than enough for two.  For dessert, we ordered a slice of carrot cake and chocolate cheesecake. They're both vegan, along with the saffron rice pudding and pumpkin pie on the dessert menu... both of which I'll probably review in the near future. The carrot cake was huge, super sweet, heavily spiced, studded with raisins and walnuts and topped with a dollop of magical cream un-cheese frosting. The chocolate cheesecake was my favorite, probably because it was doused with dark chocolate chips, had a chewy, creamy center, and a crunchy, cookie crust. Last I checked, those are the only things I want from a dessert, ever.  Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap, but the ambiance is warm and pleasant (not to mention, great for groups), the food is fresh, homemade and delicious, and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake. If that doesn't make this place worth a shot, I don't know what does.
4	wjPK0stv7c4JdRXo57SKA	So divey.  So homey.  I really miss this place.  Big Jim's is the kind of place you want to go when you've had a rough day at work.  The beer is very cold and comes to the table fast, and the food is fried, delicious, and cheap.  Some of the appetizers taste like they were pre-frozen (like the mozzarella sticks and the jalapeno poppers), but the marinara sauce tastes like it's been cooking for days.  The best deal on the menu is the veal parm hoagie, which is enough for a hearty meal for two people and costs less than $10.  The burger is also delicious, and the fries (thin and skin-on) are awesome if you get them fresh out of the fryer.  Service is friendly; they call you "hon."  They also leave you alone when you don't need anything.  Basically, Big Jim's is nothing fancy, but it's a great place to eat and drink away your headache at the end of a long day.  The only downside is that there isn't a non-smoking section.
4	rfRUo11E86KmNBg6lJFOfg	Every once in a while you just need some good Indian food to spice things up... on those days we always go to Jewel of Crown.  When you walk in you get hit hard by the lovely aromas of Indian spices... reminds you why you came!  We've probably been there 5-6 times this year and it has never been busy. It's kind of sad actually. They have a nice vegetarian selection; my favorite is Malai Kofta... which is veggie meatballs in Masala sauce!  I have also tried Saag Paneer and Bharta Makhni which were also excellent.  My Bf is also in love with the Chicken Masala... and Raita.   We typically order our food with medium spice because we like a bit of kick to the palate!  If you aren't used to Indian or spicy food, I would order medium-mild so you can enjoy the flavors before you decide to kick it up a notch.   Please give Jewel of Crown a try, it's my favorite Indian restaurant and I'm afraid it will go under if business doesn't pick up.... Oh yeah, and you'll enjoy it!
2	BKO574v4MH4AQK6IN15TXw	It's a Wendy's. The reason I gave two stars was the cashier or "service" I received.  Maybe I happened to come on an "off" day but nonetheless, I step to order after she says "next" and she stares at me with no hello or smile or expression in her face.  Moral of the story? I'd rather go to a vending machine where I'd get a friendlier transaction.
4	tgPIyJ87iE7YXk7O7ltdA	I stumbled upon Henry's when I moved to the area a few years back.  I kept driving past and thought I've got to go in there one day.  Well, one day I did and I've never stopped.  Though I haven't sampled much of their menu, the burgers are the best I've had in town.  Maybe I'm boring because I always order the same thing, but when something is that good you stick with it.  I don't want to forget to mention St. Patrick's Day, where their corned beef and cabbage is out of this world.  Yum.  Yum.  The beers are priced right, especially during football season.  Oh - a big shout out to Shelley who is the best waitress in Henderson!
4	4QPO78MiuIgzpSUhkLzBZQ	This place was what started my ramen craze!  Their udon dish and fried rice was so delicous, actually everything is!  Not only that, this is the only sushi spot that I know of... opening until 2a.m. and the food is authentic japanese cuisine, since the staff is literally only japanese.  The tables maybe small and everything, and the size of the restaurant isn't all that big... but the service is great.     If we had a restuarant that was similar to this place in the area, I think it would be banking in hella money and on top of that, its not very often that you go to a restuarant and order ramen noodle.  *Still thinking about*..... gawd..... I'm hungry for ramen.
2	akjKTPZCtA91dI3q3cyRXw	I dunno. I thought the bread was a little too thick and there was a little too much wet dripping out of the back end as I held the sandwich. I got the italian sub... thought it was going to be a cold sandwich, but the cheese was melted on top of the meat. Salami was a bit thin and the ham had just a little too much of that fake smoke flavor.   But Yelp is for my opinion, right?
2	b4VJro0kbeTmn7ndhVKRuA	I think I've ordered like cheesesteaks and other sandwiches from this place and they were okay, but I ordered a stromboli from there today. I order delivery a lot, so I try to kinda mix it up on grub hub. Well, I forgot that I had actually ordered stromboli from these guys once before and it was terrible. As soon as I bit into my stromboli tonight, I immediately remembered how bad it was the last time and knew I was out $20 again. Before I get into the specifics of the food, let me state that this place is 1.4 miles from my house according to grubhub and it still takes them 55 minutes to get here (which would be "whatever" if the food was cooked, more on that in a second). I do want to say the delivery guy is super nice, always thanks me when I include a tip online. Really nice kid. That's pretty much the last positive thing I'm going to say in this review.   So, back to the food. The stromboli was EXTREMELY undercooked, like, still doughy undercooked, and the taste, I can only equate to being a ridiculously high amount of yeast in the crust, or just flat out mold on one of the ingredients. I think it was the former, which is the lesser of two evils, but still left me doubled over praying to the toilet within 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even JUST the crust that had that flavor. After a few bites of that, I tried just ripping it apart and eating the meat out of the middle and just everything had that taste: the cheese, the meat. It was literally inedible. I threw it away after forcing down about 5 bites. Then proceeded to get sick. I still have the taste in my mouth.   Check your dough recipe's guys, and if the crust is still white and mushy that means you didn't cook it long enough! I'll stick to sandwiches if I order from them again, and that's a big if.
4	6Xjwdfm8fWlcIA39QUyMQ	I can see why people eat at Joe's late night - I'll have to remember to do that next late night I'm out and craving pizza... Joe's reminds me of a place I used to go for late night slices when I was in college.  (Go Blue by the way and if anyone reading this remembers that awesome late night pizza place in Ann Arbor, please let me know).  OK, back to reality and fast forward 12 years... I went to Joe's for lunch today.  I had their chopped salad and my dining companion had a slice.  I was kind of wishing I had a slice too, but I have to admit that the salad was pretty good!  It had lettuce, tomato, salami, and swiss cheese and a balsamic dressing on the side.  I would totally get it again.  Quick, cheap, friendly, and satisfying - how can you say no to that?!  I'll be back to Joe's for sure!
4	YNlIluNBGUw8nTGJJVZ6g	Awesome locally owned mom-and-pop type diner.  My wife and I went there for breakfast last night (breakfast served all day!).  I got the pancakes, my wife got the biscuits and gravy.  We were both very happy with the food, the portions, and the price.  The service was a little slow, but we also came during the dinner rush (which, with the number of retired folks in the area, is pretty early).  I'll be back, no question.
4	QYRavwhAQkjgYVOHUWcig	Believe it or not, the best thing about Cestone's is their ice cream, which like Darren said, resembles a mousse in taste and texture. It's really thick and holds up well in the heat. The pizza was pretty good. My burger was a little dry, though. The regulars are "nebby" as Pittsburghers say but are nice.
4	DdKOmGS5tcdaWKnhClghBw	I love this place!  Service is always friendly, food is always fresh and the papusas are mighty fine.  Esmeraldas has been around since the mid 90s which means that they were around in Las Vegas before many of the existing Salvadorean restaurants today.  Check them out and you will not be disappointed.
2	2KlP7Y0rGF6vlLDzjveA	Not to thrilled with this McDonald's today. They got the order wrong, I hate pickles, did not give us our drinks, I had to go back up twice, and I had to clean the table I understand that it was in the playground area, but the ice cream that was on the table had been there awhile. Oh yeah two apple pies means two Apple pies not one.
4	N3UMc0c6qUu5tsjkiv0gpQ	I am very picky about my asian food, being asian myself. But this place is actually one of best chinese food restaurant in las vegas. Hubby ad i always go here when we are craving chinese. The portions are good for the prices they charge. Since we always do take out, customer service isn't bad. Of course whenever we do place take out they tell us it'll only be 15 minutes but they are pretty busy so it's usually an additional 10 minutes from what they actually tell you.    I love won ton soup, but im quite picky about it however i will say that hands down this place seems to be the only place that makes really delicious wonton soup.   Great for the wallet and the tummy!
2	2sfx3Ii3rWKoV4kl4rRkw	Regardless of this review there is an obvious lack of options in the area and it will continue to be a busy business.  But perhaps someone will consider there is still a whole lot of room for improvement and do something about it!  I have yet to come to this location and leave feeling like I had great service.  I feel forgotten at my table and my drink is always empty.  Tonight's dinner was no different.  I ordered the Never Ending bowl of pasta with chicken.  *The chicken was very fatty and I had to spit out chunks of fat a few times. *My pasta was runny and mushy.   *I hardly finished any of the first bowl to even want a second.  I asked for the check 3 times and it took the server close to 15 min to get a manager to bring it over.  When he asked about my meal and I told him he didn't seem to care one bit about my reply.  Why he asked I have no idea.  Overall I feel like this franchise location needs some serious work from the "big guys".
4	2usW1uFIlRM3Pr9ptomI9g	I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.
4	4lnqQIQGwgcMgO2JUuPF6w	I like this place.  I haven't eaten recently, but I remember their food being very good.  Never had a complaint about the drinks.  It's a fun place to hang out with a group of friends and do a little dancing while watching the band.  It's more chill than a "club" and more fun that a normal restaurant.    Which band is playing makes a big difference.  I saw that Easton Ashe recently, they are very good and not too hard on the eyes either, which is always an added bonus!    As for being an OPH crowd.....I mostly go here to hang with friends and I'll admit that since I'm not looking to pick anyone up I don't really pay attention.  But we're in our 20s... So.... Not sure about the cougar theory?
2	qkyNXcLjSIUEVLRaTehP4Q	I went to the buffet when it first opened and was very disappointed. So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality.  I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all.  Our server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away.
2	BZPppzSkzRd2bFC71xu0g	Basic run of the mill Chinese that seems to be geared for the Sun City crowd. Bland and ordinary on most dishes. Family Tofu, Sweet and Sour, Lemon Chicken, gloopy and way to much corn starch in the sauce. Just over all unimpressed. We did ask them to make Chow Fun with beef and green peppers which was very good but "seasonal".. WTF? Seasonal? It's noodles, beef and bell peppers.. what's so seasonal about that?   If in a real pinch and are dying for some Chinese this is probably one of the better Chinese choices in Surprise. At least its not a chain or a buffet!
4	IkMtbjK5ihnt48tUKquyMA	Mmm mmm!  I love to hit Razzoo's when I'm in Concord and fill up on the endless catfish & shrimp.  The hushpuppies are very good, too!  I'd heard good things about the deep-fried pickles but while I found the flavor to be ok, I thought they were too dried out to thoroughly enjoy.  I will say that I think my daughter had a hard time finding something she could enjoy (the kids menu was pretty lame).  They should incorporate some smaller portioned entrees for the kids and tone the seasoning down some because she can get canned spaghetti or frozen chicken strips anywhere.
2	xq57HvBC2Rl8RdzF33t3vg	Absolutely LOVE the food. They get 2 stars for this.Service and cost are rediculous though. Owner: You  are going to lose your business if you don't start working on this.  We used to come often then quit when the service was soo slow and bad. Just bad. Didn't get coffee right away, everyone looks stressed out and disorganized. They nickle and dime you with 3 slices of bacon (really small too) for 4 bucks! and extra for bread too. Then the service got better. They hired different people. Damage control people. Now its back to the way it was. 2 weeks ago we ate outside and after someone else brought us our food, we NEVER saw our waitress again. This weekend it took an hr to get our food and our waitress had lost someones change and she was throwing things behind the counter and looked ready to cry. I was so stressed out when I left there, I said no, not again. Besides that, they said the toast would now come with the Crazy Cowboy (it did 2 weeks ago)b and last week they charged 3 dollars for it and gave my husband his 3 bacon strips and one was a half a piece. For 4 dollars. I know customers can be a pain but we aren't. We know what we want and I will even get up and get my own coffee. Tip: Give everyone their own coffee and water for the table and get organized. And smile like you are happy to be here! We do have choices of other places to go. Especially when breakfast costs us 40 dollars every time my husband and I  come here! And we aren't ordering anything special!
4	it7nhOve3lkjSWpiZg7TwA	I was in Scottsdale for a week for business and was yelping restaurants for lunch and this little place came up.  I've eaten here twice:  once to go, and once dine-in - both for lunch.    I was very busy the first time so I took back some Kung Pao.  It was pretty good, but possibly the least spicy I've ever had.  The second time I went with 3 other coworkers that same week because I wanted to give some appetizers and other dishes a try.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap (aka "Sugar Cane Chicken") for appetizers, tried the hot & sour soup, and ordered the Beef Pad Kee Mow.    The chicken lettuce wraps were very good and also fun to make.  They bring in a miniature grill with flames and all, where you can warm your chicken, before putting it in the lettuce, mint, noodles, cucumber and cilantro.  Very tasty too!  The soup was nothing to write home about, but I didn't really expect it to be.   The Pad Kee Mow was actually very good.  I ordered it spicy, and again was surprised at how little spice was in it.  It was great but could have been more spicy.  They need to utilize a different rating system: Medium, Spicy, and Extra Spicy.  I go to Thai places in OC where the "medium" spice blows away Tottie's "spicy."  This doesn't mean I didn't like it, it's just that I love the spice, baby.  I highly recommend going here for lunch.
2	Ivn5n8cv3fUQrm1BN18cYQ	A year ago, this place was AMAZING. Now, a year later :( not so much. Ordered a #1 with no lettuce and no onion.  Got a soggy cold bun with lettuce and a piece of cold cheese.  Plus neither beverage had the lid on all the way. Thankfully it is 1030pm, and on my way to my mums...otherwise I would be furious having blue colored sprite all over me. Doubtful I will return to this location, based on the down slide.
2	ynAIF3MtgdX5ksKzVNuDw	Been to this subway a few times. The place is clean. And the service is good.  But the issues I have with this location is that they do not offer a restroom at all.   Most subways I been to offer a restroom. The issue I had was the lettuce for the last two times I been there looked a little brown.
2	9Y4tVmtpFCm9uaGtvbBAuA	Potatoes and coffees were good. Carne Adovada was highly anticipated coming to the table but was little more than pork slow cooked in a lot of  sauce covered in a white quest sauce. My GF got the ajo wrap said it was very greasy. I must say the toast was excellent with homemade bread but I was little dazzled by the rest of the meal.  Recommendation: get coffee and some challah and be done with it.
2	CB6fMlHA2byooi5nc9aA	The workers at this location suck. The tall dark-skinned dude that takes your order doesn't say a word. Doesn't greet you, doesn't ask what you'd like, doesn't tell me my total, just stares at me until I hand him my payment. Doesn't say thanks, won't even tell you if your foods ready. I once sat there for 10 minutes waiting for my food, while it had been sitting there the whole time because no one told me it was ready.  Then there's the 'manager' guy that looks like he should be working at a Game-Stop, with the attitude to boot. Arrogant and a little rude...you work at a Jimmy John's, man. Chill it with the attitude. The only ones that seem decent are the girls and the guy running around in the background, not taking orders. The only reason I have to deal with these goons is because they won't deliver to my house, 3-MILES AWAY.  Needless to say, I'm over this location and it workers. I'll be going to the location down Harris Blvd, closer to Northlake from now on.  I gave the extra star because it's Jimmy John's and the foods good.
4	eYQffqMIJIFUeZr8b2D0yA	Woot! Love this little place and am super happy to see a non-chain pizza joint nearby. Well, relatively nearby.  I can't speak for the subs and salads yet but the pizza is awesome. If you like a sweet tomato sauce w/ some basil in it to flavor things up... this is your place. Super good flavor. Salami for topping! Yay!   The place is pretty small and every time I've gone there's been a decent amount of people eating. Staff has always been friendly and helpful. The decor is done up with donkeys everywhere and has that unique, independent charm that I miss from my old Austin haunts.  I seriously must try the ice cream place that sits at the side!
4	AIB5HueYDZ1zJT4mJ4qF7Q	This is the place for hot and sour soup! I always order it when I go there and it is always awesome. It comes with large shrimp and pieces of chicken so it makes a great lunch on a cold day. It is also something I like to eat when I am not feeling well.  The rest of the food there is good also and not very expensive. I take a friend sometimes and we split a bowl of soup and a lunch entree. Plenty of food for both of us and for around $10-$13 it's a great deal for lunch! This place has been around for a very long time and I hope it stays around for alot longer..
4	8Tk6AFKUBREz4XwtpF9Q	Solid 3-1/2+ stars. 'Cheers' kind of feeling in this place. Friendly service. Great for watching UFC fights! Nice beer selection. Good people watching. Check-in offer is great except for the fact that you REALLY have to hate AC/DC. (wink wink) Food has its ons & offs but they get creative with the Specials menu & offer some good food. Clean environment. We are regulars on fight nights.
2	Mg2dJXG1yeHL1wmnjpFoVw	I live about a block away from here. Could've been my "corner bar" but I have expanded my horizons across the street to Cafe Milano's. The bartenders are not friendly. They kind of just stand there, hand out mediocre drinks, and rake in tips. They don't make any effort to make your visit memorable. The food is okay. Usual bar food. Nothing really stands out.  The drink prices are a little high, and they have crappy specials. Needless to say they don't "hook you up" no matter how much you tip. And it's almost always hot and stuffy. I'm serious, I don't think they turned on the A/C for the entire summer!!! There are better choices within a block, try Salonika's next door or Cafe Milano across the street.
2	Y19BcxJpyMN1EExLekxaqQ	I've never been to an In-N-Out, I've only seen instagram pics and etc so since I was starving and wanted some fries and decided to expand my beef taste buds (I don't eat beef,but when I do it's only Taco Bell and Five guys) so I went through the drive through since inside was packed. I got my meal and sat in my car and ate thinking with such amazing great reviews I'd have the same experience, but no.   When I got my food it smelled like fish, the fries were okay, not what I was expecting and the burger was okay. The only good thing about the food was you can taste how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes. Also the girl at the drive through was nice, that's about as all the good things I can say. I'm so disappointed, I was really wanting an awesome meal since I didn't feel like driving to a restaurant in old Scottsdale and waiting for my food and being even more hungry. Either way I will not eat In-N-Out ever again, just not my cup of tea lol. I only give two stars to places I will never eat again.
4	0luIj22eUYe0PvmGqPuT3Q	I am a fan of this dive.  Once again, I lived in this neighborhood, but I had a blast.  We used to come to this establishment with a huge lacrosse team full of dudes after games, and they would put up with all of our BS.  We would sing karaoke, act like idiots, and make fulls of ourselves.  21 year old athletes would be dancing with 50+ year old regulars of this dive.  This is a great spot to go when you have a group of friends that doesn't want to be seen.  A dive bar that isn't a Scottsdale "dive" bar (you know what I am talking about ahhhheeemmm Coach House).  It truly is a local watering hole.  If you are in the market for some food, this is not the establishment for you.  I am pretty sure that the pizza we ordered once was simply a tostinos frozen pizza that they had to run to the 7-11 next door to pick up.  Whatever.  I wasn't expecting much.  Cheap beer.  Great shots.  I think they even have a picture of us up on their website.  Very enjoyable.  I wish I was the first to review!!
2	fZwBiZtS71pziq5L5LAs9w	After eating some of the worst Mexican food ever at F-berto's nearby, I decided to try Poliberto's after work....While it was overall better than my traumatic experience, I can't say this was that much better.   I made a huge mistake ordering the Carne Asada Torta...everything fell apart and the meat tasted really bad.  I'm used to a good, fulfilling, crunchy big torta like they make them in SF for the same exact price.  Unfortunately, this torta failed miserably in comparison.  I seriously have no clue where to get good Mexican food in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale, but I won't give up without a fight.
4	ocWTLghWWFW4wgfUX1aupQ	Pretty tasty wings. If you have a rental and have some time get an order for your hotel room and munch on them when you get home from the club or casino. They also have a tasty philly and yes..it does come with chesse whiz.  Can't speak for the pizza but I'll have to give it a try when I go back.  BTW..you can eat in too but the AC is pretty weak and it gets stuffy in here but they do have beer!
2	ssy3XWMG12swsL8GE9vtg	We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good.  I had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops.  My wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing.  She also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it.
2	oIQEQjYTpneKIj65998mzg	Ugh, that's all I can say. I'm current staring at the nearly full chow mein box on my kitchen table from No.1. I had a forkfull and I was done.  The food just tastes bland, inside each noodle there is a hint of flavour but its encased in a 2mm thick layer of grease. Seriously disappointed. I agree with Fiona about the amount of time they take, even though it was Saturday night, they still took like 25 minutes.  I don't know what I should do with this tub, there is enough oil in here to solve our global energy problem. Might give Saudi Arabia a wee phone...
2	NR6A1fd0aI22048r7CWgyw	While working in the area I decided I would give Franks NY Deli a try. Pulling up I had to double check the address as Franks is located in a small neighborhood market.   The food is not deserving of the ratings here on Yelp as it is lower end processed meats and the menu is very limited with maybe 10 sandwich options.  I got the NY combo which is simply salami, ham, and choice of cheese. The sandwich is on a 10" roll and you get the basic toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressings.  The sandwich and a 16.9oz beverage was $6.45 which is a fair price for what you get.
2	8QesJI2h9NadQ9G0oR4b9g	The wife and I have been longtime customers, but we have both noticed a distinct reduction in quality the last couple of times in. The next to last time we were there, the time it took to get our order was very long--two tables nearby, seated well after us, received their food long before we did. More to the point, the preparation wasn't comparable to past visits.  The first time this happened, we chalked it up to a possible new staff in the kitchen and the inevitable growing pains that come with breaking in new cooks. Things happen, and we didn't hold it against the restaurant.  But we didn't go back as quickly as we had in the past, and when we returned last (about 8 weeks after the previous visit), the serving staff seemed to be completely different and the service was still extra slow. We even asked for a simple side substitution (one vegetable which was priced on the menu at the same price as the item the dish was normally served with) and were told we could get that item as a side at extra charge, but not as a substitution. When the food arrived (after about 30 minutes), they did do the substitution after all, but my food was barely warm, as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for the last 10 minutes--and the restaurant was 3/4 empty at the time, not busy at all.  I think this visit might have broken the spell. After a few years of what would have been 3-star to 4-star meals, our last couple of trips have been 2-star--and I am not certain when, or if, we'll return.
2	i1QApSQt8a1PD65qMy4jw	I really want to like this place, and I will continue to go (due to lack of other sports bar options in the area), but this place just is not that great though it has the potential.    The few times I have been there, there have always been problems with the food - and I mean service issues, not quality issues - which leads me to believe the management could use a little makeover.  I have had cold wings served (I mean cold, not just not hot).  Wings take over 30 minutes (at which point they were canceled).  The food is fairly decent though, for bar food.  Nothing I crave, but something that will get me by during a big game.  Last night I went in to watch the ASU/UA football game and they had the sound on for the Cleveland/Heat game.  Really??  Do you know what state your bar is in?  Did you happen to notice that half the people there were wearing ASU or UA gear?  Apparently the manager wanted to hear the starting lineup.  I can kind of get that - I had curiosity around the game too - but if you want to see that, then tune into Sportscenter AFTER the ASU/UA game.  After the starting lineup was announced, and about 15 minutes in the football game, they changed the sound which was greeted by loud applause in the bar.  Little things like that make me believe the management is not in tune with the wants of their patrons.  They do have PLENTY of TV's to watch games and accommodate requests for game changes.
2	t9shce4Ut9BMYND9Eif8g	Not so very good, and definitely not better than any big chain fast food. The fries had no flavor, O rings were strangely sweet (cornmealy?), burger was just "meh". Won't go back unless I need some frozen slushy high fructose.
4	VYw2afIpmuLY9aUcjXZRA	Did more searching for Best Burgers in Vegas and found this place to be on LVRJ's ("Las Vegas Review Journal") 1st of 10 burgers mentioned in their article "Meet The Top 10 Burgers In Las Vegas" back in 2009. Since I've been on a Burger Binge, I had to try this place!  Fat Charlie's Burger and Fries: comes with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Server even asked me how I wanted my egg.. I got it over easy (over medium may have been a good choice as well). Yes, egg with burger has been done before, "Fat Burger" was the first rendition I've ever had a burger with egg. But this place does it BIG!! Quality of the patty was good overall, juicy enough and lightly seasoned. Buns were proportioned well with the steriod pumped patty. May want to jog around the block before and after a Beast like this! Fries were the fat potatoey delicioius ones! Went hand in hand with the burger.   Interesting enough, everything else in this place was Super sized! They had a Huge wrap around bar filled with character - bikini tops/bottoms hung from the metal bar roof, super high warehouse type ceilings (you could stick a freakin' palm tree in there!), Jumbo sized decorations hung from the ceiling - A Huge Marlin or Swordfish, Cowboy Riding a Shrimp.. Weird but Fun!    Sweet service, Great burger for a Great price, Unusual and Interesting Decor! It was like eating outside a ranch but inside a building.. Dive Bar Gone Wild??!!
2	3ht5RE0RZsrQJ8Oopee0sA	I had hoped for more.  The service was OK. Not great. The food was also OK, not great. This got a 28 Zagat rating and I have no idea how. I would try it one more time and my wife would not. So we are not going back. Even the bread was bad. Blah.
4	aOOzT3CNAzPSMXLTE7p0LA	The server had an awesome attitude (a little awkward - may not always match the customer but he tries!). The food is typical for a Perkins...filling but nothing special.   My tip: make sure your definition of over medium matches the cooks. My eggs weren't even fully over easy. Can you say "slimy"?
2	26RVMCBt8xKGxCIBUaHvg	We came here for a quick bite and the especially feminine male cashier forgot our curly fries like three times. He was like "Omigawwwd I totally forgoooot." Then five minutes later, he screamed and jumped away from the frier-- "Omigawwwd I'm like, so scared it's gonna burn me!"  It took literally fifteen minutes from when we ordered our food to get our stupid plastic trays full of crap. I thought this joint was supposed to have "fast" food. We sat in the dining room, which might have been our first mistake. Oh well.  Also, our tacos had way too much lettuce and not enough meat. Boo, Jack in the Box.
2	ji0deI5TEFsnaDl7e5Fg	Not sure why everyone keeps raving about this place....  After much insistence, I gave up and went to see what all the hoopla was about.  Going during the dinner rush, I was immediately crushed both in front and back with families of 6 to 8.  No one ever brought bread to our table even though all the tables around us were served at least two or three times.  We requested bread four times and had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  Still no bread, and I ran out of water so consistently that I had to swallow the food dry.  The roast was cut with the grain, making it inedible.  Veggies were overcooked.  The famous steaks people are always talking about were nowhere to be seen since they closed the grill.  As we left, the manager must have seen the unhappy look on our faces and asked if there was anything he could do.  We explained what happened to which he apologized and said that if we sat back down, he would make sure bread came to us.  Yeah, cuz the bread is SO good we want to go sit back down and wait for possibly forever again.  GUH!  Thanks, but no thanks...ever again.
2	LENWXoobfRTaTtwMGf37w	I don't know why I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's the atmosphere, the lighting, the service or the 9 hour wait, but something always keeps me craving it.   The food here, as has been my experience at most other Cheesecake Factory locations, is right around mediocre. I can't quite put my finger on it; it's pretty good, never bad or not fresh, but it almost ALWAYS has me running home right after to take care of some, er, business. I heard once that they don't change their cooking oil very frequently. Whatever it is, it always gets my stomach, and the same holds true for everyone I go with. We actually coined a name for it, you usually get the "6 o'clock sweats" - you go to bed okay but then wake up around 5 or 6 am with your stomach turning.   The service at this location was great and we dined outside, which was nice (large seating area out there). Skip the sangria and stick with the martinis or margaritas, or just plain beer or wine.

Piper's Pub came up and friends gave it good reviews so we headed there after my flight arrived. The game was on and there was a great crowd as well. Draft choices were excellent and food was delicious as well. I ordered the shrimp something...I thought it was going to be battered shrimp but it wasn't but still tasted excellent. Definitely would go back next time I'm in town!
2	7B5FWGfF6firtoylA8Zg	I'll start off by saying it looks great inside.  Plenty of room, friendly service, even a Terminator 2: The Arcade Game in the back, but the Pizza was really lacking.  Not enough sauce (and it wasn't very good sauce), a bit too much cheese, too much oregano, I dunno, it was just lackluster.  Although I was surprised by the crust, which was actually decent.  I don't know what it is about Arizona, I can't really find a decent slice out here.  I'll just try to avoid pizza as much as possible until I got back east, which is a shame, because I love pizza.  Also $2.50 for a slice!?!  If it was huge I would understand but c'mon.  Check out Lorenzo's in Philly for what $2.50 SHOULD buy you.
2	lIaqtik8DDEOzEeyQ	This restaurant has very good service, and is an extension of the Cabo's franchise when Station Casinos bought Santa Fe Casino and turned it into Santa Fe Station. It is, indeed, located in Palace Station on Sahara and Rancho.  I rate this restaurant 2-stars because: *) Medium Rare steak was delivered Medium. *) Fried Ice Cream came straight out of the freezer...not fried at all. I used to work in a 3rd Generation Mexican restaurant as a line cook...fried ice cream is supposed to be...uh...fried. Yes, fried. You know? In a deep fat fryer?  The reason this restaurant earns 2 stars is because of the wonderful service I've predictably gotten every time I've eaten there (about once a month for several months running) and the tortilla chips served with three kinds of salsa and bean dip.  I would really like to rate-up this restaurant but I'm afraid I can't. Maybe in an update, but listen: Medium Rare is a very common, well-taught serving of ribeye and if you can't serve it correctly...pfft.  Open for dinner only, too. Whats up with that?
2	z9B36uuuCJuRX3bECKFzQ	I know it's just a Denny's, but I have always appreciated a tasty Grand Slam any day of the week and, after I had just lost over $300 on (what I still believe to this day was rigged) Blackjack, I needed something on the cheap.    We popped in at a not-so-prime time (there were probaby only 5 other tables filled in the whole place) and our waiter failed to deliver prompt refills - one of us made it through the whole meal with no refill.  Food came out pretty quick, but even though I expected everything to be cooked into one greasy mess, the GrandSlam-wiches had a hint of some kind of cinnamon ingredient that, according to the menu, should not have been there.  Add on the Kenny G and Michael McDonald on the radio the whole time and it was a complete buzz kill.  Sorry Las Vegas Denny's.  But I expected more/average.
4	n3PPM8YkzIoSNiKulyQA	I tried this place based on the review I found on Yelp!  I also love the bi bim bop.  Yum! This is a great place for a quick, casual lunch. Lunch was $10 incl. soda (not incl. tip) today.    Staff is pretty attentive and easy to flag down. The food came quick, and I was probably in and out of there in 10-15 min.
4	pfpuorLNG77iZDS3qLbnw	Honestly the food is great, although their single burger prices makes one have to buy a meal ($5 for a burger).... I enjoyed the food better than Mickey D's- I wish there was one in the Chicagoland area
4	TIU97wIv0r4dsq8orxAg	Have been at this location many times over the past 10 months mostly during the AM hours on Saturday.  Service was fairly quick. The fill up on the coffee could be quicker.  Food was good and sometimes very good for breakfast items.  Look for a generous coupon in local mailers and you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal for what IHOP can deliver.
2	eYAgHw5cAcX4hnghvnQ	I can't resist Fish and Chips when I go to an Irish restaurant. So this is what I measure good Irish food with. Very forgettable Fish and Chips at O'Donoghue's. It's a damn shame, really. It would have been nice to have more competitive Irish restaurants in my area. Rula Bula is still #1 in my books.
2	1bEljbe12FkuHQD90a2MlQ	I used to go to this place mainly for my oldest son's birthday back in the days. I always enjoyed it. But you can tell when things are on the down swing and they are cutting corners. I always remembered their chicken wings. But they were good and nice size. No more!!! I was looking for something healthy on the menu and I struggled. Really struggles so I ordered the Chick magnet, Was small which was fine with me with a large salad but both pretty tasteless.  I must say service was excellent. And really put my daughter on the spot singing to her "Happy Birthday". Decor has been the same for ever. We sat in the Elvis shrine. lol....
2	UzXP43LdEJMVvDlDQjOrg	I really, really, really want to like this place. Why? Because it's on the first floor of my office building, making it the perfect location for those days I've been too rushed to eat breakfast or when I'm too caught up in work to leave for lunch. Unfortunately, the location (and friendly service) are about all this place has to offer.   The espresso drinks aren't half bad - in fact, my Americano was comparable to that at most other coffee places - but the veggie sandwich I had was atrocious. First of all, it had random veggies like black olives and shredded carrots that don't usually appear on veggie sandwiches. At least in 2008, vegetarian items are expected to be as interesting and tasty as meat-based dishes, and someone ordering a veggie sandwich is expecting hearty vegetables like asparagus, mushrooms, or artichokes not the toppings from a house salad. As if the veggie selection weren't bad enough, everything was absolutely drowning in mayo and the bread was dry. Not good. Not good at all.  Dagwood's definitely has convenience going for it, but I'd rather drive 2-3 minutes and get a great sandwich at Wildflower, the Vig, or Bertha's.
2	FMzRzutyJMrMm1vkK2qrg	I had a flight going out of D terminal, and Burke in the Box "on the fly" looked to be the best option.  It might have been, but the spouse & I were put over a barrel to figure that out.  I had an Arizona Iced Tea - $4!  Spouse's 20 oz Diet Coke - $3The sandwich & pizza prices weren't much better, price to quantity wise.  The food was decent.  My tuna slider's were tasty, but were better once I took off the pickle (too much dill).  They also would have been better if they'd given me one larger sandwich, rather than 3 mini sandwiches.  I don't need that much bread!  The fries were fine - nothing special, other than the fact that they didn't screw them up.  But 1 pizza, 2 drinks, and the tuna sliders came out to $33.  That's *way* too much.  Next time I'm at this terminal, I'll just stick with Baja Fresh.
4	lEQZSgNRaR0m4jtFiLcaw	I always wonder whether I should bother writing up fast food places.  But in this case, I decided I should.  This is for two reasons.  One is because Jack has a great menu.  It just sounds so good - all those things on the menu just make the mouth water.  No "double cheeseburger" here (or McDouble as it's called now).  Instead you get a BBQ Bacon Sirloin Burger.  With curly fries.  I love curly fries.  Anyway - the other reason is the staff.  At least one member of the staff.  I think her name was Shelia.  She was just a bundle of joy, and this was at a fast food place, during the lunch hour, when she was absolutely slammed (and the people behind her were a bit on the slow side).  She would make a note of people's names, rather than calling them by number, and as people left - at least as we left - she would even remember their name.  How impressive is that?
2	POpmmIYmXORiQxd7jLTriw	Believe it or not, I am ONLY giving this place two stars for the fabulous company I was with and the decent food however the service left alot to be desired. Otherwise it gets a ZERO!   So after arriving (albeit I was a little late by like 10 mins) my party had already been seated and we had been chatting for about 13 mins before anyone had acknowledged us since everyone had sat down. Why do I know it was 13 mins? Because one of the ladies in my party happened to notice the time and made a comment about it.   We were finally able to flag down a waitress, who in turned flagged down another waitress, who in turned flagged down yet another waitress to take care of us. Geez?! Finally one waitress seem to take pity on us and we were able to order our food just 10 mins shy of happy hour which ends at 7pm. What happened to the initial waitress that got water for us before I arrived and gave us bread, we will never know as she was never seen again. ( and no she was not the busgirl)   Now we each ordered appetizers and pizza. Nothing too complicated right? Que 25 mins later, (now I was timing it) and only one person had received their appetizer. I finally flagged down the manager and asked him if it was normal practice to take 25 mins to wait to have appetizers served and even longer for our pizzas to be served? We didn't want them to come out at the same time as that defeats the point of an appetizer right? He was friendly enough and apologized profusely and then proceed to the kitchen where ta-da our appetizers were just finishing up and double ta-da, our pizzas showed up about 10 mins later. (SMH = Shaking my head)   The calamari was ok but there wasn't enough of it. It had more fried zucchini than calamari which was funny as I ordered a calamari appetizer. The roasted chicken pizza which has gorgonzola, onions and apricots I believe was really good, but I only at one piece as I had eaten most of the calamari/zucchini appetizer and frankly after waiting so long, I had lost my appetite some.   Will I go back? Probably not. The funny thing about this entire situation is that everyone was really looking forward to eating here and it wasn't even busy!! You would swear it was a Friday night with the service we had. Oh well, everyone can have an off night and apparently tonight was theirs.
2	b86Kgjy1qgiUDAhWpVWBSg	Have gone a few times over the years, mainly because its a convenient place to pop in while strolling in Little Italy, and I've always left feeling like something was missing...or off... from the dining experience.   A lunch time pit stop with a girl friend left us staring at our bill in amazement (2 panninis and 2 lemonades rang in at over 50$ with tax and tip!) We both had the prosciutto-mozzarella-red pepper pannini which wasn't bad but certainly not worth the price. It was stingy on prosciutto and the mozzarella was a little rubbery. Its fine quality for a quick, cheap bite but at that price, I expect better.   Service wasn't terrible and certainly courteous but not particularly attentive. Although our waitresswas suddenly much more attentive when our very attractive male friend stopped by our table!  Pet peeve - our waitress replied in French when we attempted to speak English.   A quick dinner stop last Friday wasn't much different. We had the margherita pizza and sausage pizza and neither were showstoppers. The crust was very thin and well cooked(plus!) but both the cheese and sausage tasted very pre-packaged and neither pizza arrived particularly hot.   Service was better - our waitress was bilingual and took time taking our orders and offering up clarifications (maybe because we were joined by abovementioned attractive male friend?) Although when I asked for San Pellegrino lemonade, I was brought a random brand of sparkling water...  Restaurant itself is clean and spacious with comfortable seating and large screens which permitted us to watch hockey highlights.
4	ZekL4kigL1yg0GqqetSyA	Really enjoyed my first trip to this store! The cashier was welcoming and kind. I am enjoying my red bean paste pastries more than I had imagined. I wish they had more options for their milk teas but I will certainly be back!
4	xuDMKWxrwppi7f9ReTXQ	OK, I have had my eye critically on this location for some time now. Verdict: MUCH IMPROVED over former staff. Managers on duty are always actually on-duty and working. Cleanliness has gone way up since my last review. Staff is always friendly and customer service is quite a bit above average in my experiences with other locations. They are definitely on the right track. This location could certainly use a renovation, but overall I have been well pleased as of late.
4	HzeU53SmLyzluGzOveFhdg	We stopped here based on a recommendation from close friends and I can say that any negative review is emphatically incorrect.  We ordered Chicken and broccoli, Wonton soup, General Tso's Chicken and an egg roll.  The egg roll was fantastic.  The General Tso's Chicken had just the right amount of spice.  The Wonton soup was immensely flavorful.  All in all this place has a style of Chinese food as close to "New York" style as you are going to get out here in Las Vegas.  It's a total "hole in the wall" kind of place, so don't come expecting fine dining. They have a drive thru and picking food up seems easy enough. I totally recommend this place wholeheartedly and will return many times to sample the rest they have to offer.
4	heenITfZxjozPuYwkGNvg	Any restaurant with a daily meat-and-two is my kind of place! Sweet tea and cornbread- what's not to love?  Only the locals seem to know about Tryon House. It's location a block off Woodlawn probably doesn't help, but they don't seem to be hurting.  This is another of CLT's many Greek-owned establishments. A lot of the menu is similar to a dozen others in town. That said, as a group these guys seem to have completely figured out the comfort food biz. After a rough day/week/month, this is the first place we head.  Meals come with complementary soup. More than once I've found myself wishing I hadn't ordered a meal at all and just gotten a bucket of that stuff.  Personally, I'm a fan of the chicken parmesan. Enough food to feed a linebacker and right tasty. My wife's favorite is the pasta with garlic and grilled chicken. She always manages to get a lunch out of the leftovers, too.  They'll ask if you want bread or cornbread. Get the cornbread. It's some of the best you'll get in this kind of place.  This is our place for family gatherings. They've got a big room and the staff seems to take groups with squirming kids in stride. It can get noisy if you're near the room, but not to the point of distraction.  The staff is old-school diner friendly. Good chance you'll get called "sweetie" at least once.  About the only problem I have with this place is the cost. More than once I've had an OMG! moment at checkout. That's mostly our fault (the chicken parm I love is about the most expensive thing on the menu), but the 7.95's and 8.95's on the specials menu do seem to add up awfully fast when there are three or four of you.
4	0dleRuSoRtOkEKBK0B7PQ	Nice Italian restaurant with a good menu. A bit pricey compared to other restaurants in the immediate area, but a better restaurant. A nice place to take the family for a special occasion.  They also offer take-out, and have a separate take-out counter. I like their pizza.
2	v9j7ogtVNJ0UrmPsJc7Miw	Was really excited to try this place as the west side has so little to offer outside of chain restaurants.  This place is a far drive from anything else but thought it was worth it if we liked it.  The bartender didn't show up this particular night so the staff was overloaded.  When we asked about the event posted on the website and their sign posted outside, the owner said "we don't do that anymore".   Other than the paninis, everything is overpriced.  The $19 cheese/meat plate had cheese crumbles rather than chunks of cheese (difficult to eat), thinly sliced meat, 3 grapes, 2 dried apricots and a few italian toasts....very disappointing.  We'll likely not return or recommend this place to anyone.
4	lBiX1RRFhht3tjlNVD9Q	Since there is no other Indonesian restaurant in Madison, there is no competition. Still the food is really good. Make sure to get the desserts there as well. I like the ambiance there as well - cool artwork.
4	a9YdRnMzStEZUmgYOxw	Absolutely love village pub. Great bartenders, great food, good crowd. Happy hour specials on appetizers.....best bargain I've come across yet. This is my spot when I'm in town visiting my family.  The staff at this establishment are A+
4	pyODwaaI7Ee9HxyL5rgzA	Wed afternoon, 3PM - Fantastic sushi and service.  Employee synergy was so good I had to ask the sushi chef (not the owner) whether or not it was a family owned restaurant.  My internal SushiBar\u2122 was set by a once amazing Japanese sushi bar in Hollywood, a family run (in its heyday) bar I've frequented since I was a child.  Only today have I run into anything comparable.  Service was great - neither the chef nor server were overly talkative, but both were really pleasant, polite and attentive (I was waiting a moment as I'd ordered 2 of the most elaborate rolls I saw).  Despite my having ordered my sushi to-go, the chef served me a cucumber salad and the waitress brought water, which was kind.  I ordered three rolls, one of which was the Touchdown roll on the recommendation of an earlier reviewer - NICE!  I've forgotten the names of the other two rolls but, at the moment, I'm calling them all delicious.  The fish tasted fresh and I thought I could taste everything used in the rolls.  Impressive.
2	D5hIMG02NuAxG7PYNPgOwA	It was rather slow for a friday and I thought i would order the turkey and cranberry sandwich with a drink. the only thing good from my purchase was the cookie and the drink.  for not having such a long line that they normally have they should have been able to put a little more love into making my sandwich.  The girl went overboard with the cranberry spread and when i took the toothpick from my sandwich  it broke so i am not sure if i ate some wood chips...lol, on top of that i had cranberry all over the place i was better off just getting a cranberry sandwich cause there was hardly any turkey. for a place that charges 7 dollars a sandwich they should make it look like it is worth 7 dollars.   If i want a messy sandwich i will go and get myself a 5 dollar footlong.
2	oRGMWakN4JhpS309Hylg	This place is an A&W/ Long John Silver's combo store so all your french fries taste like fish. They do have root beer on ice cold tap. Some of the items on the menu are ok, but most of time I leave disappointed. They do have a jukebox and lots of comfy boothes but its still fast food & its fish & burgers. Not the best but if your intoxicated it'll do.
4	s6r40vC0unK97QjcjYKyQ	Village Tavern is one of my favorite places to go for lunch in Charlotte. They basically cater to all, so you can always find something for everyone here - and they've got a great selection of salads and sandwiches. It's a good place to meet friends for lunch and catch up, and getting a booth seat makes the experience more intimate.
2	i7uFkdWyIms49pMRMPY5Q	This is one of many "sports" bars near the stadium.... and near my home.    I usually end up here not for the sports aspect, but for the near-home aspect.  My meterology roommate is to blame;  he drags me here for tempting reasons such as "one beer!"  or "It's weather-man appreciation day."  How can I say no?   (He fancies the bar because there is always one television showing the weather channel).  It's easy enough to carve away some space, if no where else than at the sidewalk-window.  I can get by.  .. and enjoy some great conversation about what precipitation probability means.  Anyway, I'm getting at a point here.  The point is, while the conversation is pretty geekishly delicious, the beer never is.  It's always off.  I coulda sworn the Stella Artoise was switched for bud light.  The next visit the Newcastle was weak and smelled like sour socks.    Is lucky's getting old kegs or treating them in the sun?  I don't like their funk beer.  2 stars.
2	c9p4ECkuL2EhllcnNKBGpQ	The staff was very friendly and I received fast service, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the food.  Most pieces of the steak were too fatty to eat.  I'm willing to try them again - hopefully will see an improvement.
2	p6dyClGZaeRm6pg7ifz9dQ	So the service was bad. I must admit I really liked what I ordered however my boyfriend was extremely displeased with the quality of his meal. First time we've been to this place, probably won't be back. From what I've read the only thing that sounds good is their bar.
4	WRs3KFY5P10VmvaJLGEig	This was a great find. I had a yummy carne asada burrito for only $4.95. I am stuffed. Good food, clean and friendly staff. I talked to them in Spanish, which was fun for me.   I was here for a conference at the M Resort and so I just found this place on Yelp and came here because it had good reviews.
2	u4ZW8VRed1d9lkctNBmUrA	I like Chick-Fil-A but it's too expensive for fast food. There isn't anything about their food that makes me think a single chicken sandwich should be that price. Their fries need a ton of salt for me to enjoy them. I'd be lying if I said that their chicken wasn't good but I rarely come here unless I have one of those GET A FREE SANDWICH coupons. Otherwise I always feel like I'm getting ripped off.  Also   PS: Chick-Fil-A, being closed on Sunday does not make this Utah. You're still in Arizona where employees usually don't mind working on Sundays and customers get frustrated if a place is closed all day.
4	mfjCRcD22kkfFGm6Exx1pg	There's something about hoagies from pizza places.  What makes 'em so good?  I've hit a lot of local pizza joints including Aiello's, Conicella, Italian Village, Mineo's, Monte   Cellos, etc. They all have uniformly great hoagies.    So when I stopped here after doing a site visit for work, I ordered the half-sized Italian sub--ham, salami & capicollo with provolone cheese.  This hoagie ranked up there with the best of 'em.  Even though it was only a half, I could barely finish it.  Good thing I didn't order any sides.
4	w2G7joBrNuwN1iuTnpMLtQ	Come for lunch while window/regular shopping on State St.  Crossing the street from Art Gecko to grab a bite as I didn't feel like cooking at home I get an order of spring rolls, chicken teriyaki and a juice.  It's Simple. It's Amer-"asian" food.  We all know it's not authentic.  You're not crossing the Great Wall after battle for a great meal.  It's a good filling meal when you've been walking around for a couple hours and want to sit inside (upstairs when available/open) and chow down with a great view of State St.
2	PNojrK8j5mRrw9ZRK4kmYQ	These other reviewers are CRAZY....   Average at best.  Sushi was good but the other food left something to be desired.   Sushi rolls were more rice than anything.  Decent selection of sashimi.    Went for dinner - $50 with drinks - not bad but as stated, the sushi was the only think worth going back for.   They did have crab/crab legs that were good - how can you really screw up crab legs?   I would recommend the spicy beef & teriyaki chicken sticks but didn't really like any of the other dishes. General Tsos Chicken tasted more like sweet and sour sauce with hot peppers thrown in.    I will say that we went during the week at about 8:00 (2 hours before close).  Maybe they "step-up their game" during the weekend.   Also - its not the cleanest place.  Tables were clean but the rest of the place could use a good scrub down.  I guess I may have expected too much from a buffet place.    All that said - doubt I would go back.
2	8iNpR7XnEWYxeOpZSc3Aw	Needing one last drink on a Friday night, we grabbed a table...and waited, and waited.  For fifteen minutes we were completely ignored.  We saw waitresses walk back and forth, but by that time (11:30 PM), they were more interested in hanging at tables talking with friends than picking up any new business, even though they were supposed to be open til 2 AM.    Not all was lost - I was still able to enjoy some semi decent tunes before we got the picture and left.  But not early enough to avoid the x rated entertainment.  Apparently some drunk chick mistook a table and chairs as a mattress and some pillows and thought the thing to do was dry hump and try to undress her date.  And she wasn't cute.  Ick.
2	qHM2s7VMVZ04V6FMg5zoQ	I thought this place was so so.  I went this past Wednesday. I was greeted and led to a nice place by the window.   The service was better than okay - although I do think my server spent quite a bit of time chatting with a favorite customer.  I think that's great, but pay attention to your other customers especially when there is hardly anyone in the resturant. I just didn't think the food was good.  I ordered an iceberg lettuce salad - as it was so hot outside I thought a nice crisp salad would be great.  Well, it was not that cold and it was almost wilted.  The dressing was abundant - unpleasantly so - with garlic.  I had envisioned chopped candied pecans - they were sort of placed on the plate to the side along with a cold strip of bacon.  Not too much effort went into this salad.   I also wanted the weekly selection of ravioli - but they were out of it - even though it didn't seem as though they had a rush at dinner (this was about 7 pm).  I had some meatball dish with a five minute poached egg on it which was again, okay.  The crostini was the best part of the meal.  The hostess was very nice.
2	Ssj1MQTWJKvm3xfwXmQ	Been to a number of Jack Astor;s before.  Great experiences good food, reasonable prices. Took the family include grandkids. Service was normal, perky waitress tell us her name takes orders disappears. Food handlers deliver food. I ordered beef fajitas. I hear sizzling plate but onions and beef must have been sitting as they were lukewarm.  Guacamole looks dried out and dull like a green mashed potato No one asked us if our meals were good. On the way out sought to get a comment card, Fellow at front desk appeared too busy chatting up hostess and inattentive. Looked at us like we were from another planet. Looks like the kids were running the show without adult supervision.  No asking if we were happy with our meal. Very unlike other Jack Astor's including this one which we have visited before.
4	oHQRmNmoCDT3zdfsgjTrEw	Viva El Taco has been my late night stop since before I met my husband. Now that we live in Henderson I seldom get the chance to stop. So last week when we were on the way to my Dad's we stopped by. Wow! They have not changed a bit! Still yummy as ever!   This was my husbands first time trying Viva El Taco. He ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I got the Carne Asada burrito. Both were loaded with meat, guacamole and pico! Mmmmm soooo tasty! They also have a killer fish taco. My husband has been craving that burrito ever since!  Not only is the food awesome, but the prices are great too. If your on the east side make sure you swing by for some tacos.
4	wRe8ORmePFY8J10TO6cCFw	Drew's has become our go-to breakfast place.  My husband & i used to try to go to the Square Cafe on weekend mornings, but upon seeing the hoards on the sidewalk waiting to get a table, we just kept going down the hill to the Parkway, go one exit to Ardmore Blvd. and have a terrific meal at Drew's.  We'd been turned off at the Square by high cost ($4 for a pancake? Really?!?!), cramped space, long waits but Drew's is comfortable, the waitresses are pros and food unpretentious.  I docked them 1 star because their coffee always tastes a bit stale, like they need a new Bunn.
4	FXMO3cfSxVtQv88uqSYlmg	Sigh, why can't Jack in the Box actually finally open up a few locations in the Chicago area, like they did until(from what I've heard) 25-30 years ago? I think they'd do great, if they ever came back.  Anyway, just got a quick bite since I couldn't decide on something to eat while inside Stratosphere, and it was good as usual. Love that you can get breakfast items all day, and that it's disappointing it took McD's until this year to finally test a (partial, unfortunately) breakfast all day menu in some San Diego locations. Ranting aside, I got 2 breakfast sandwiches that were great. Customer service from the employees was friendly, and I didn't encounter too many weirdos walking up to here during the late afternoon. I suspect it might be a different story at night, and possibly not so good to walk to at night.
4	J3rJUuNGzYopJMA4JRJf3A	It's 3am on a Wednesday morning, and you can't walk straight. With a stomach that's only known a liquid diet for the last six hours, you tell your DD this will be much better than Jack in the Box. The night's been full of questionable decisions...one more couldn't hurt, right?  La Salsita has a nice array of different meats and veggies all ready to be loaded into a tortilla. If you want something quick like a burrito, it's like Chipotle for people who aren't afraid of Mexicans.
2	txVOIQEbJ2oLbR2QBl4eEA	Bland & Boring BUT Cheap. $9.99 per person.  Smallest buffet I have ever seen. Very limited selection,dessert selection is the WORST.  Nothing special-the pictures tell it ALL.  Service was fast & friendly but didn't make up for the food.  I won't be back unless it's FREE.
4	ChYM6YThKEzhmiLEQo12Kw	Yup, I like what I see and what I like seeing is real homemade corn tortillas on a parilla! Parilla Suiza keep it goin' you're doing something right! I haven't been disappointed yet.  I enjoy the tacos with carne asada, the parillada was huge and that arroz & beans... mmm... rico.  So the only thing I noted changed on my last trip was a re-vamp o the menu... Originally I was a bit disappointed that they now have a burger and ribs on their menu... nothing about that is Mexican but HEY we are in AMERICA baby and in America we enjoy a good burger or ribs now and then, so... why not!? Although I haven't given them a whirl... nor will I because my trip to La Parilla is strictly about the Comida Mexicana!  Thumbs up Parilla keep those corn tortillas coming!
4	n6H71vI6Ive0kgwqjDgIPA	A rare occasion when i disagree with one of my fav Vegas foodies , Ms. Blair B.   Now granted, I'm in a desperate state trying to find some variety on the Eastside for my lunch fix.  Luckily, i'm only out and about 2 times / week so i  usually hit catfish alley,  Pho Thanh, las pupusa and a few others.  I think this place comes close to  Capriotti's - darn close.  And come on, at a run down gas station ? Now granted, i'm not a cheesesteak expert, though i've eaten at geno's and Pat's ( i prefer Pat's )  but on one of my visits i brought along a PA born cheesesteak "expert" - he gave the place a thumbs up      I tried the Cheeseburger my last visit - $3.95 for a 1/2 pounder with cheese and grilled onions ...ehhh ok.   I noticed a south philly cheesesteak place at trop and pecos near the BofA - I'm thinking a two hour lunch - hit them up and then off to play me  some pinball !
4	oSmMztqmxe6ciyXqtn2Ww	While I'm a fan, we don't eat here very often. That said, it's a lovely venue, if you can sit outside on the lake; and the food's goth good and imaginative, though pricey. Don't take your kids here -- they annoy me in upper in restaurants.
2	dqD0X0A8GB3a77sOY1SZJw	I feel bad bashing what is obviously an old, well respected fixture of the Park Road shopping center. But I gotta do it.   The decor is so great, so checkered, so old school diner. Lingering smoke, very intense. Mirrors and bored hostesses. Awesome.  For a vegetarian, this place is optionless after 11 am (an no, they won't fix you an omelette if it's 11:10 - them's the breaks) other than the veg plate and an amazingly, insanely bland egg salad sammich. So that's what we got : egg salad on white (there was no mayo, no herbs, no nothin going on here) with a pile of diner fries, good fries, and a veg plate - 3 slices of tomato, 4 banana-tasting slices of fried to liquid zucchini, three broccoli florets with a somewhat creepy "hollandaise" dripping into a pool at the bottom of the bowl. For 6 bucks.    There's so much better food to be had in this area (hell, even this shopping center) for the same price or cheaper.
4	sGlMlJEWx6eV9an9E4WiYg	Eaten here 50 or more times.  Food is very good, always clean. Hot and sour soup is always great.  Serves canned soda but I don't see that as a drawback unless you expect free refills.  Jenny - the owner is really sweet but gets lost with big tables and it has helped that she always has help now with the table service.
2	0KEY9BvW8j18U86liRu4Yg	I truly wanted to like the counter. A burger joint within minutes of home that didn't have a clown as its mascot? Sounded good to me. Sadly though the reality of the counter is that in 4 visits they screwed up our orders 3 times out of 4. Fairly incredible when you consider that the kitchen is working from customer filled-out checklists.  Once when we were in we were one of 3 occupied tables. The food took almost 30 minutes to arrive once ordered. Another time one of the management was at the entrance and was angrily trying to either get the attention of or berate a member of the staff. He did so by raising his hand in the air and repeatedly snapping his fingers at the staffer in full view of the entire restaurant. that sort of thing should be kept behind the scenes. It just made the manager look like an imbecile.  On my fourth and final visit I had to send back a burger that I had ordered medium-well that arrived on the rare side of medium. The waiter looked at the burger and said "Our medium well is like that." Their medium-well? I was sort of flabbergasted  and simultaneously amused by the thought of arbitrary meat temperatures, it would save restaurants having to re-cook items. "No ma'am, OUR chicken, unlike other establishments birds, are fully cooked when pink, not to worry."   I won;t be going back, when I get a jones for a really good burger I'll drive the extra 8 minutes to Big Daddy's Burger Bar on East Blvd.
2	xaJzCxAbGHYhy7MTZ6zmQ	I came here with a large, and it was kinda of tight sitting against a wall with no way out. For an Italian restaurant that service sushi. The food was not that bad. I had the cannelloni, and they weren't that good, they were dry and tasted artificial. The Sushi was good, however to a "Sushi Shop" quality.   Entres were less then desirable, and didn't taste like they should. I felt something was missing. Like the Love italians put into making food.
4	Ples3Xdg5sUrGV3caCwew	I don't venture down to Henderson much...by choice...but I am glad I met this girl in a coffee shop.  If I hadn't I would have missed a great Italian Restaurant.  The atmosphere is top notch.  Every place setting was perfectly laid out, and the tables were close enough to be intimate but not so close that you were rubbing elbows with strangers.  The calamari was tender and breaded to perfection.  The 75 dollar tasting menu with matching wines is exactly what all tasting menus should be.  Lots of food, thoughtfully prepared with exceptional ingredients.  The wines were exceptional and complimented the food to a tee.  Great for dates, romantic without being TOO romantic.  I say this is an excellent place for a group of adults, a first date or a married couple out for a nice meal but don't want to spend 150 a person.  The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing and they answered every question my date had.  Highly recommended.
4	8lkeLLBVVqryVfW1DMTLBw	Guedo's (Hwed-ohs, not Gweed-ohs) has been a long standing favorite for many years. It remains up near the top of my list for lunch or dinner.  First of all, remember it's a taco shop. Do not order the filet mignon there, unless it's rolled into a taco. They also have burros and cheese crisps, but it's all basically the same stuff. There are plenty of veggie items as well as excellent fish and shrimp tacos.  The ordering of meat tacos is pretty basic: you say taco, you say beef, pork, chicken or combo (the combo is best, it is spiced differently from the rest), you say if you want cheese or not, and you can order some add-ins like guacamole. The rest of it you build over at the fixin's bar.  Pay for your stuff and take a seat until you are called. There is limited inside seating, but there is also tull outdoor seating as well as an enclosed patio. The recently added cantina features a full bar.  If you are trying an Atkins diet, tell when when you are ordering, they have a few non-menu options for you. I have ordered off of the catering menu and gotten a pound of their beenj with fixins for $10.  It's good, basic Mexican food served by nice people. If you want something fancy, try El Zocalo just to the west. I'll take Guedo's 8 out of 10 times.
4	ADSEWvklW89aXKnPcy0lQ	Visiting from CA & arrived at the hotel on a sunday night (yesterday). I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich & jalape\u00f1o poppers for delivery. The food took a while & when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost & went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back & the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt & I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious.
2	21TBW5Bwg4FflkFt3XB7wQ	Disappointed. Getting our meals after ordering took too long and the last of seven meals came 8 minutes after the rest. I had the calamari marinara, the sauce was NOT homemade and fresh. It was served on linguini NOT the angel hair pasta I requested. The person ordering the pizza said it was only average. The Caesar salad I had was only OK. We would not return here.
4	mlhPcEQQ4JPmzN6CRAo4Q	I have been here several times and always enjoy myself. The menu and the specials are exciting, the staff go out of their way to please you, they have a tremendous wine selection for you winos, and the food is excellent for the price.  Nice and dark, with a modern, upscale feel...
4	Wz5zWQZN8Dn2iz14gPTBJA	The last remaining Farm Basket in Las Vegas. SO SAD about that. FB is a unique but very delicious fast food shop that specalizes in chicken and turkey items. Best on their menu is the Great Gobbler sandwich, a deep fried half turkey breast sandwich with Miracle Whip.There's something so great about this! Perhaps that it's cooked to order and fresh helps. It could also be their delish fries (if they are cooked in turkey fat/oil it explains ALOT of why they are so great) that are served with a Lawry's seasoning salt. Simple, but oh-so good.  For me, it's on the other side town, but when i'm in the area, I have to get some. When this one closes, it will be a very sad day for me.
2	EpC2ZWhPBBNWaoIOM5cHA	I feel I can't be 100% fair since I did not order the pizza or a regular entree but what I did order was a disappointment so that is what I am judging here.    The minestrone cup of soup was not bad but nothing special and my side salad was inedible due to the ocean of balsamic vinegar that was poured onto it.  The croutons were so soaked they were black.  I had to ask the waitress to please take it off our bill.  My parents were satisfied with their eggplant parm plate and chicken parm hero but I wouldn't think a bowl of soup and a salad would be that difficult to get right.  From what I saw the pizza looked like pizza hut or dominoes style not real pizza...  I don't think I would go back here.
2	ENfFCPUBlbdPIB8iqa38MA	I was so happy to find a boba place right around the corner so I wouldn't have to drive several miles to Lee Lee's or Asiana if I didn't feel like making my own.  I requested an iced soy latte boba (like I used to get from my old fave Eba Cafe) but they couldn't make a latte.  I settled for an iced green tea with boba (brewed, not powder).   The boba had a nice, chewy texture but was totally flavorless.  They were also skimpy on the amount of boba that went in the cup.  The tea itself was bitter (my guess is that they let it brew too long).  All in all, I wasted my five bucks on that and won't be going back again.
4	T0vnvzijRhypVqYECRJJTA	No Yorkshire pudding...NO YORKSHIRE PUDDING?!?!?!  Other than this one serious omission from the menu, the British Open's menu is chock full of great English fare as well as a few tastes from around the world. I've been to B.O. twice now and have had great service and food both times. This last trip I had a nasty head cold so I got a bowl of Green Chile Stew (not something you'd normally expect to find at a British Pub, but I was most glad I did). Well, that green chile did a fantastic job of burning all the crap out of my sinuses and I was able to breath for a good hour afterward (one of many great uses for green chile). We also had the Sausage Rolls which we proceeded to drench with HP Sauce and devour. B.O. also has a great Bread Pudding!  The atmosphere is great, but I did notice one small problem. The place isn't very handicap accessible. There was a woman who came in while we were there who had just had hip-replacement surgery. There was no place she could sit at which she did not have to climb a step and it was obviously very difficult for her. After witnessing this I looked around and realized that there were no tables that would be accessible to someone in a wheelchair.
4	od1FMjOQq1ASWTsOcLQZA	At first glance you might not look at Gino's and think "Let's go there for lunch!." But think again. Gino's serves up some of the best on-the-go sandwiches I've found in Madison. I love the veggie sandwich--it is packed with loads of flavorful ingredients like olives and artichoke hearts and a zingy vinaigrette, all delicious wheaty bread. Very reasonably priced!  The market is noteworthy as well, offering all you authentic Italian culinary needs. Plus, there is a great selection of prepared foods (fresh and frozen) that will jump out an you and call "dinner." I've tried the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. It came with a huge portion of french bread.   The staff at Gino's is always friendly and helpful.
4	Hq5jYx1aYC4XwJwVyp9s6A	Went there for breakfast this last Sunday morning and it was great ! Food was great service was great and the atmosphere was great watched the planes come and go from our table and they have an upper deck to sip your coffee from if you want to after your done eating. A little hot but fun with the grandkids! Family place. totally recommend it. Will go back for the lunch soon.
2	bu8grxktqpeK8LxfiskgYQ	The prices are reasonable, and the option to get a 16 inch sub is certainly attractive after working up an appetite (or forgetting a meal), but the pizza here simply isn't that great.  There's not much a pizza parlor can do if the pizza isn't good.
4	RLL94Wn9qX7cnIoCfrIL4A	Decent, fast Chinese food.  Can't really go wrong with a dinner that costs less than $10 and leaves you with enough food for another full meal the next evening.  The Kung Pao Chicken was pretty good, a little heavy on the sauce perhaps and the egg drop soup was basically broth only, with some egg thrown in, guess I didn't really know what I expected.   Definitely a good place for takeout, not much in the way of ambiance...
2	JNONHQnjA9dgn1ndrhntJg	Went to Porte Grecque again reluctantly, it was my sister's birthday. This place was  good about fifteen year ago especially when there were no Greek restaurants in the west island, somehow their food has lost its taste over the years.. The food was just too greasy, service was kind of slow. We started with the over fried vegetables zesty pikilia platter, made me feel queasy later.  The Calamari was also too greasy and soggy. I had the lamb chops, scallops covered in bacon and scampi, with a salad that looked like it came out of  bag and I barely touched it. Lamb chops were okay, so were the scampi and scallops, but I would no go to this restaurant on my own free will. My nephew loves this place, as he says you get a good bang for your buck. This is an average Greek place kind of on par with Casa Grecque, if that's your thing, go ahead and enjoy. One more thing they seated us upstairs, but on Feb 18, 2012 it was 25\u00b0 outside and it was boiling up there however in winter it is pretty cosy.
4	9Kua2tBCieJnXT9BpfM9EA	Furio's is fabulous on Monday nights for Martini's & Mani's.  I absolutely loved having my nails done while sippin on a cosmo.  We were scheduled for 5PM enabling us to be the first nail customers.  Then we had a few more martinis while gabbing & waiting for our nails to dry.  We didn't dine there but heard they have great food.  An added plus was the flat screen over the bar that allowed us to keep an eye on the MNF game.  Would definitely return if I get the chance!
2	Lb5hONkVtLcPGTAUfD7ciw	Lunch early afternoon cook and waitress are less than stellar as well as the food during this time.  Our Cabernet burgers were overcooked when we asked for medium well.  This is the second time as of recently that we have have been there and have been unhappy with the wait staff and cook. When the owners are cooking the food is amazing.
4	ryrRQzNyHoC1FP5X2jsTg	I was road tripping through Phoenix on my way to Sedona and was craving some breakfast like foods on the cheap and quick.  Lo and behold a burrito place in the strip mall where I  as grabbing some groceries.  Sold.  They have lots of Mexican food options but I went with a chorizo and papas burrito and it was large, cheap and didn't give me gut rot.  That is three stars right there.  I also got some horchata and it was ok, but nothing to rave about.  The place had the feel of a local chain, but I wasn't really there for atmosphere so I don't really have anything more to say about that.  All in all this place did right by me and that makes me a fan.
2	6B4RhvG9vaFLFhaunKlQ2Q	I get to little Caesars i tell them what i want i got a large pepperoni and a pretzel pizza on the signs it says hot and ready between  4 and 8. They didnt have any ready, they said 8 minutes okay 15 minutes later then its finally ready. Dont advertise if your not gonna have it
4	MWenLM5v6PuuNu3e4SvMGA	I used to come here many many years ago when I lived in the area... it was one of my favorite places go for sandwiches.  And I made it here for lunch finally once again.  It was as good as I remember.  This time I wasn't very hungry so I settled on the Harvest Picnic which was very good.  It had roasted red peppers, avocado spread, mushrooms, tomato, cucumber, romaine lettuce, alfalfa sprouts and hot honey mustard on on 9 grain bread.  I will definitely be back since I am in the area now I can't wait to try their huge menu of sandwiches, soups, salads and even shakes!
2	1VCLQfPZtiUprNU3wOQSCg	Had the worst sandwich I've ever eaten and the soup was ok.  How do you serve a sandwich with soggy bread when it was just made? Why put quarter chunks of avocado on a sandwich?  Slice it over the sandwich....  The steak and blue cheese salads was horrible too. My daughter barely ate it and she usually can eat the whole small bowl. The tomato soup was ok. It's the only reason it has 2 stars,  otherwise it would be a 1 star.  And then to think I spent that much money on so a horrible meal. Never going back!
4	rFsEKxxykp44fqHlt0NTA	Never have a problem here at all. We normally go for lunch getting 5 dollar deals, or the go meal. They always get it correct and are friendly about it.   The cashier is normally prepping something, but as soon as you are ready to order they get right to the register. Really good customer service for the past year or so!
4	nLI0UYI9ONXTif1NrsZSQ	Maharaja's lunch buffet is very good - offering a lot of options at a great price. I have been a couple of times when the food was not as good as at other times, but all in all a good place to eat.  And you have to have their chai tea. I've never been to India or had chai tea other than at American places, but this tasted authentic and very yummy.
4	vdBynLicrQMcfjnzNOXz1w	Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from... everytime I've been here, I've had great service. I go in the evening, and it's usually the woman waiting on me, and she's polite and helpful if you have any questions.  The food is awesome, best kung po chicken for the money in this area. Everything else I've tried has been good also. Ridiculously quick preparation, almost like fast food.
2	Qb8y1uAbryDrrFuCQYNsg	Fearing salmonella from the chicken in a place like this, Monkey opted for the "lost all respect for the word steak" grilled with half an onion on a naked, please no diarrhea-baked potato. Long day down and on the standby bubble, I was hungry. Flavorless cheese sauce on the side, I felt safe. Time will tell.   Why this isn't rolled in pancake batter and deep fried, is beyond me. Dunking it in a bowl of nacho cheese sauce and sprinkle with crushed cool ranch Doritos and whalah!  Obesity. PepsiCo may invest in this idea and sell it at Taco Bell soon.   Probably will not return, though hunger has subsided. $7 for naked baked potato with some meat & onions. Safe, right?
2	g4fyFZZsDcOSHYUpDyTag	I can only give this place 2 stars simply because it just isn't nearly as fun as the one I remember from when I was younger.  This one only has some fairly lame video games, and a small tunnel system for kids to climb through.  Everything here is overly expensive.  Tokens themselves cost at least .30 cents per token, and kids win tickets playing games but unfortunately you have to spend about $500 dollars to get enough tickets for anything remotely cool.  The kids do like coming here, but kids are pretty easy to please when you throw some games and pizza in front of them.  I could get way better value taking my kid to the arcade museums we have here in the Las Vegas area.  The pizza is better than it was a few years ago, but it's still nto very good, not very big and cost about $20 for one pizza and 2 drinks.  There were several machines not working at all, with kids losing tokens because the games don't have any indication they won't work.  I came here for my son becaus the school was having some special school night here, but otherwise I would rather take my child to something more fun and more productive than this.  I have also been to kids parties here.  The parties always feel somewhat rushed by the young staff and is crazy expensive for what they actually give you.  2 stars because kids like it, bot nothing more because it's dirty, expensive, and the food isn't very good.    NOTE:  Parents do not seem to know how to watch their kids when here.  I always see kids stealing tokens off tables they don't belong too, and just kids in general runnning crazy with no supervision.  If you bring your kids here, I would hope you at least keep them being respectful and at least be aware of what thet are doing.
4	hcN0Lzl8HWlgq97Ft3D4EQ	This place was a lifesaver - was in Phoenix on a road trip when all three children got sick.  Must have been from all the candy and Thanksgiving food etc. at grandmas the day before.  They were in need of some good "home-style" chicken soup.  Well, in the area we were staying there was a CVS and Circle K on every corner yet no possible place for soup.  I also stopped into three separate Subways who all had only broccoli cheese soup... weird ...  then I turned a corner and there it was Boston Market, place was empty as if they were waiting for me.  I got two dinner plates and a huge family size chicken soup, great great service, extra bowls and plates etc, Rushed it back to the hotel.  Kids ate, tummys felt better and they went to sleep.  Mission accomplished!  The food is fresh and has that home made feel/taste...  What a welcome thing on a long road trip.
4	4sl51OafknDDbl0kxLDsbg	This is the only place that my Japanese BIL will go for Chinese, outside of his own kitchen. The food is quite amazing, but the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired (explaining the four stars).  Their menu is HUGE and they don't just have your run of the mill Chinese. Although I've never been bold enough to try some of the more authentic dishes, I have seen some of the most amazing things come out of the kitchen! Whole fish flash fried and served up like filleted works of art, ducks with their heads on (ala A Christmas Story), vegetables that I don't know the names of, and platters of sizzling noodles topped with exotic sauces. Most dishes can be made to your liking if you are put off by spicy, but my preference is for the full flavored versions.  The dining area is one large room and is sometimes a little on the warm side. Take out can solve this, but I think you actually get more when you eat in, so I generally stay and take home the leftovers. Service is typically fast and always friendly as it is a family run establishment that even the kids are involved in. Portions are family style and although you can easily get away with a meal under 10$ per person, 12$ to 15$ will guarantee you a veritable feast!  I typically base my reviews of ethnic establishments on the percentage of patrons that share the same background and Big Wong's is a mainstay for the Asian community here in Phoenix. Next time you are in the area, stop in, order a poo poo platter (he he I said poo poo) and prepare for a feast of the sensations.
4	o1qLwaRzoKdDwBFTixfSg	I went to Biaggi's for the first time last week (Nov), and I had a very pleasant experience.  There were only a few people in the restaurant (we went for a late dinner), so I can't tell you if they get busy or not, but they seemed to have plenty of space.  The environment and service seems to be in line with other franchise restaurants, that is to say nothing special, but I did enjoy the Frank Sinatra music playing and the soft lighting.  The booth we sat at was comfortable as well and our waiter was very nice.  Onto the food though.  The first thing we were treated to was a hefty bread basket which included 2-3 different kinds of bread and our waiter prepared a plate with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Parmesan cheese which was extremely delicious.  The combination of those three mixed together was enough to make my Italian genes satisfied, but then we were promptly brought out our main courses, both of which were also succulent.  I had the Ravioli Quattro Formaggi and my girlfriend had the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni.  The Ravioli had an appetizing cream sauce, and the crab had a refined sweet taste.  We both were completely satisfied.  If you're a big Italian food fan, I highly recommend.  My only knocks were that the prices were a little steep for what was offered and the franchise feel of the place, but otherwise the food and service was great which is really what counts.
4	93adwuQm7FbtUP8WnpZRnw	Very small eating space in the middle of a small fish market.  Very friendly staff, gets very busy for lunch!  You may end up standing and eating! :)   I am in love with a fish? sandwich?  BEST fried fish sandwiches!  I am not usually a fish sandwich type, and this was very good. Very simple looking, but great bread, very fresh fish, good crunchy coating, nice, piping hot and flaky fish inside. No fishy aftertaste either. I used tartar sauce on mine....MMMMMMmmm.....I will never be able to eat a filet-o-fish again. :)  Fries were run of the mill, and room temperature. I will let this slide bc the fish sandwich was sooooo GOOOOD!   We also had the creamy crab chowder which was delicious! It doesn't look like much, and there isn't a lot of chunky goodness in it, but it sure does have a ton of chowder flavor and creaminess, without being so heavy and thick.  Nothing beats a hot bowl of soup when it's 10 degrees and snowing out either!   We also ordered the fried shrimp, and it was just okay, nothing special, could not compete with the sandwich.
4	HymY1CWx3LLbDcSlUHCxkg	I have been pleased with my last few trips to Burger King. In both the drive thru and inside dining,  the staff have been very pleasant, helpful, and provide great customer service. The food was cooked well, tasted good, and presentation of food was good (for a fast food restaurant. ) It is difficult for me to give a fast food restaurant five stars (needs to go beyond my expectations), but this location is pretty close.
4	DeLzHeCD8DInwiTLVLIdw	I happen to really like this place for breakfeast. I have been going to this location  and the other location for years and always happy with my meal. I used to get the Bubbas Benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. But now they make it with turkey sausage so I dont get it anymore. Now I get the eggs benidict. Its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it. Im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise. The waffles and french toast here are good as well. This place has burgers, salads, and sandwiches to. Prices are good. $5-10. I dont think they have anything over $10 on the menu.
2	sYQCaZ6eeAIWplrN85Z7g	Service was friendly, but slow.  Food was mediocre in quality.  Everything overpriced (by about 35%) and small portions (2 pasta dishes, plus chipotle chicken sandwich with fries).  Not worth it, in my humble opinion.
2	11ocB5F9TyDEiS7JxMXw	This place definitely needs some work.   The service was great, the one thing I really had an issue with was the quality of the food.  I ordered a sandwich from this Ihop location and what I got was a soggy mess.  I couldn't even finish it since there it was literally unappetizing.  Worst $10 I've ever spent.
4	jklXB0xA6rNNl6CGbhAHQ	I called one night for a take-out order, and the person on the phone informed me that after 10, they have 2 for 1 pizzas. I paused for a moment, wondering if I heard correctly, then for some reason said "No, thank you." I don't know why, either, I was confused! I have since filed it away in my brain, and have taken advantage of this many times.  The pizza is always good, cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients. My favorites are the Rustica or the Artichoke. I am also a fan of their sandwiches. Whenever I've gone in to get my pizza, it's always full of fellow pizza fans.  Look, some have said that it's not the best pizza, and maybe if you're expecting a typical American-style pizza you might find at Fuel or Hawthorne's, it's not as big or as greasy. But if you think of it more of a flatbread, or perhaps deliciousness in a box that they give you 2 of for no reason at all, it is perfect for me.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of the teeny parking lot. It's not their fault, and I don't really know where they would expand, but it sure is awkward to get in and out, especially if it's full.
2	4IvTsG48kFrnikDyoqVZxA	The dining room and ambience is fantastic. The service is second to none. The food however left way to much to be desired. Every dish was just average a few were below average. Had to send one entree back, the steak was a tough as a goodyear tire. Not one of the 6+ courses was a stand out or even worth remembering. I did not expect every course to be fantastic but their reputation did not live up to what was served at the table.
4	E7gAemH6KVBTWGJMAWP0MA	We have been going to May Graden for quite some time. They do not have a big selection but what they do have is very delicious. The lo mein is amazing as are the cream puffs. The orange chicken, sesame chicken and fried rice are very good as well. The staff is always attentive certainly not friendly. We love this place and will continue to go back. The one knock I will say is the restrooms are disgusting and the interior is very run down. Not dirty just run down. I understand the location is kind of in a poorer neighborhood but that should be no excuse for upkeep.
2	8iIVG41NiMT0ESmU2YC3tg	I have been to many a deli my friend and this is not a very good deli. The kosher style corned beef they attempted was fatty, some of it was chewy and parts of it had been exposed to the air too long and gotten a bit hard.   I also suggest more training on the deli equipment before someone is in need of stitches from the slicing wheel. The girl making my sandwich was having a hard time as a result of the previously mentioned hard portion and nearly pushed her finger into the wheel before deciding to shut it off while she fussed over the meat.   I like to watch someone fussing over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger.  The potato salad was very bland.  Rather than leaving me with a fond memory of deli's I have been to in NYC, Boston, Cleveland, etc it left me wishing I had skipped it and wanting the real deal even more.
4	hGNcNKcSo56F5moiSZGA	Here is the deal with Falbo's  Don''t expect any, and I mean any, customer service. Expect to call and have the person on the other end of the phone be rude and inattentive. Also, always have exact change if you get it delivered, Falbo's drivers are known to not carry change.   That being said, their pizza and salads are boss. This is a working mans pizza (food not price) and damn it is good. The salads are also amazing and generously portioned.   If you can put up with the attitude, falbo's is worth every penny.
2	dc9zk4Dgg123DLi7jg	It was ok. Service not the best. I love the color scheme and general design but it was pretty awkward to be in fashion square mall. i was not very impressed. i thought it was over priced and not enough food, i also had a disgusting house martini that the waiter said was like a mojito- bad description.
4	MYor82Xl8IHRuHGqBHf0A	Tried Lims for the first time. The fried rice was great. The pepper steak was good but could have used a little more flavor. The portions were good size. The crab puffs were also nice and big. The average dish is $7 - $8 which is great for the amount of food you get. We will be back.
2	6mWQBGJ3fuOBB8ENQedUZw	The calamari was rubbery, over cooked.  The salad was good... (Chopped wedge). Decent bar selection, beers were okay, some fun choices.  The grilled rib eye was not tasty at all.  I wish I would've got some fish instead..  I won't be back.
2	jBQOcCl2GStRoNogjUg8sw	This place looks the business but it's a shame about the service. Like Johnathan, I had to sit and wait at least 15 minutes to get our drinks. When I did decided on what I wanted, my chicken came out stone cold, and looked a little pink.  I kindly informed the waiter that I didn't order the food poisoning and he took it back and got me a new one (which was still cold, but not pink). Very sketchy...
2	3F3SgC4WOcdJpvfVqbbvpA	So...I've driven by this place a million times and always wanted to try it. What a disappointment! My family is Italian and this place is as Americanized as it gets! I got the vodka tortellini dish. Was NOT good. If you are looking for an awesome vodka sauce, check out Maggiano's in Scottsdale. It's the best I've had here in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is really odd almost slightly creepy. We went for dinner and sitting in an office dinning room having dinner is somewhat strange. It is on the first floor of and office building so I can understand but still. Maybe this place makes more sense at lunch time but for dinner, weird. Check out their website and you will notice no pictures of the dining room.  www.alexisgrillphx.com  Our server was homophobic. There were three of us, myself and my two friends. He was cold and unfriendly. Being in the "gayborhood" I was pretty surprised. We all felt awkward and uninvited.  Bad food, strange atmosphere for dinner, unfriendly server.  I won't be coming back.
2	CgQpDxQQUflCxjTQxrLiQ	I don't go to the Suncoast. Ever.   I had only been in there on one occasion before yesterday and that was to see Paranormal Activity with some friends. That was almost 3 years ago, and even back then I could see that I definitely wasn't missing much.   Yesterday, I just so happened to be at Tivoli Village for the first time (I also see I wasn't missing a whole lot there either, but that's a different review), and since none of the restaurants in there appealed to me and the friend I was with, we decided to just drive across the street to the Suncoast. Turns out this was a bad idea.  The whole place just felt very......empty. There was no line for the buffet whatsoever, and when is someone NOT happy about that? That's the gift. What lies within the buffet is the curse.   Not having to wait in line was nice. The price wasn't bad either, $8.99 to be exact. The service: so-so. Our waitress always had a smile, but she wasn't the most attentive either. The ambiance was quiet. Way too quiet. The place also had this creepy, medieval dungeon like feel to it. *shivers* As for the food? Oh dear.  To begin, let me tell you something funny: the section that was labeled seafood had none whatsoever. It was used for cold cuts and bread. (Yes, you read that right. This is a buffet that has cold cuts.) The stromboli and taquitos were so dry. Quite possibly the blandest sweet potato fries I've ever had. The best part had to be the waffle fries and the spring rolls unfortunately. As for my friend, she claimed her food (which included some of those cold cuts from the "seafood" section) smelled funny and had to stop eating because the smell was making her sick.   Why 2 stars and not 1? Pumpkin Cheesecake in the dessert section, that's why. Ironically the only buffet I have ever been to which serves it.   The Final Verdict:  Pros:  Cheap. Pumpkin Cheesecake.  Cons: Generally gross. Slightly creepy interior.  Severely lacking in variety.   Suggestions: Just go to another buffet.  Return factor: Nada, not even for the pumpkin cheesecake.
4	cWIkmAz9seJ7b7n942JdQ	Sounds cheesy maybe but Subway is my favorite place to eat for a quick, healthy under $ 10 meal. They are always efficient and their sandwiches are consistently good and taste fresh. I always get the same when I go: turkey on honey oat bread...   I kind of blow the healthy equation every time I go there since I add two cookies to the sandwich and considering they are worth 210 calories each, yikes to the belly!  The staff is always friendly and eager to please. Some have more attitude than others (you know who you are) but that makes the visits interesting and lively!  If you are pressed for time and don't want to break the bank and yet want to eat healthy, it's hard to beat Subway....not even a burger joint can come close!
4	SOYUx1MkFHxZwS4LyFg	The cashier was very friendly. The wings are awesome, they're not the small wimpy ones, these wings are big and have a lot of meat on them. They're not stingy with their wing sauce, or ranch. Having a paper towels on every table is very convenient. Place is a little too small, so it gets crowded easily.
2	ePlh7iHWeC9rT5kxJi6J8A	The service was very good and quick. Ordered a Octoberfest burger and guest a cheeseburger.  The amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed. Can't say either of us was impressed with the burgers. Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler (though that's doubtful). Don't mind spending $10 for a burger, but IMO this one was not worth it.
4	kkrTilptgFCW2xDby4o3SA	The Seafarer, like all Southern "Fish Camps", serves up all sorts of seafood and accouterment, with the majority of the items being fried.  The restaurant is owned by the same family that owns South 21 curb service on Independence Blvd, which has been there since you could cross Independence blvd at numerous intersections, even on foot (way long y'all).  That being said, its quality junk-food at its best.  Its by no means healthy, but its a lot better than any fast food you could put in your body.  The tartar sauce is famous and for good reason...its the best I've ever had and cannot be replicated (the recipe is super secret).  They have two types of cole slaw, either mayo or vinegar based, both of which are delish.  I like to go during the week to beat the crowds, as on the weekend it is out of control (you can tell by the size of their parking lot).
4	SuJ0lPgYvuR8ahUxIoNsSg	Who would guess an outstanding pizza place would be found within "the walls" of sun city west?  Don't be fooled by its ordinary looks... The owners are friendly, the dough is outstanding, great crust. And the sauce is fresh tasting not the usual placid tomato paste found in most other pizza joints. The owner and I had a nice discussion about deep dish dough...
4	VOHKdym9kQuC7etKBtXZvQ	I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back..
4	OsuO6001Gaesc1wesXZ4wg	The customer service is phenomenal at this Jack-In-the-Box. Anita who works drive-thru along with a few others is always ready to please and friendly. I eat here only around twice a month because it is fast food and I am not a huge fan of putting fried grub in my belly. I have had the breakfast Jack sandwich which is always hot and fresh. I normally stop in for lunch once or twice a month and get the jumbo Jack with cheese which is good. Their milkshakes are also good but too filling to have with any other item on the menu. Make sure to ask for a Jack card. It earns you free food off the menu over time. If you enjoy JIB often it pays to get hooked up with a Jack card!
2	oFZME3UJ2nZRRxnEO6dmnQ	I actually really didn't like this place. I expected way more because it seemed like it would be really great but the food tasted bland to me...  I might be convinced to give it another shot but for the most part I really just doubt I'd ever go back when there's so much great food to be had around here.
2	qCieMFS4oEZpaeBsD26fw	The food was fine, but my problem was with the service.   Our waiter was hard to catch, and I ended up having to get help from the sommelier twice because he was the only one who checked on us.   The sauce that came with my steak had cilantro in it, which I dislike.  I asked if they could make it without the cilantro, and the waiter was pretty rude and told me that they don't make the sauce fresh, so they can't make it without any ingredients.  I would think an expensive restaurant like this would make their sauces fresh and would accommodate patrons. I agree with everyone else-- the music was too loud.  I couldn't carry on a conversation with my guests at all.   If you're looking for a good steakhouse, try the one at Circus Circus.  If you want to spend a bunch of money on a mediocre dinner so you can brag to your friends, try Jean-Georges.
2	LTx67hxZqx9Q3aKblc1UZQ	Beers are mediocre here.  They got rid of their best beer last year, the Bavarian style Hefe-Weizen and replaced it with a watered down American wheat.  Appetizers are above average and an exceptional value during happy hour.  Pizza is very average.  If you're a beer enthusiast then don't bother, but if you like fried appetizers, cheesy breadsticks (Oggi stix), then this place will work for you.
4	wTbTZ0cX9vYGA7ZBz0uA	Food Express is one of the restaurants that we always go to whenever we are in Vegas. Unfortunately, Food Express is still under renovation. There is, however, a Food Express II located in Palace Station. I haven't tried the second location yet, but I did notice that there were fewer choices on the menu. The prices were also a bit higher.  On a side note, we drove by Cathay House (another restaurant we always go to) and the Chinese name of the restaurant changed (new management?). Anyways, we took a look at the menu and they seemed to have a lot of new items that used to be on the menu at Food Express. Maybe one of the chefs from Food Express went over there? Too bad I didn't have time to go to either restaurant.
4	1W00BPCNu5i8GfOcQcDa3w	What can I say about my favorite restaurant in America?   I was used to eating almost weekly at a Cracker Barrel when living in Florida. They don't have them in California so I was willing to drive quite a bit while visiting a friend in AZ just to eat at one.   I was not disappointed. I got biscuits and gravy - a cracker barrel staple.   This place was amazing. Service was excellent, and the manager even came to check on our group of eight.
2	WUEJe0gS8Svdutf1MdYFw	I had my hopes of trying PINK's hot dogs for the longest time, and I finally tried it here at Planet Hollywood's Race & Sports book.   OOooOoo... What a disappointment!  It was just a small little stand with one worker who looked like he didn't want to be there!  I ordered a regular hot dog combo, which came with chips, that cost $5.95. The chili dog combo was $6.95. It just tasted like a regular hot dog, except that it had a nice "snap" to it (which made me give the place an extra star!). Other than that, nothing special about it. The chili tasted like crap on it, probably because it was old and in the container all day! Ewww! Actually, I bet all the food they served there was old! EKKKK! =O  I had asked the guy working there when they will be opening the actual official stand, and he said he wasn't sure. However, they will be opening one near the Hawaiian Tropic entrance of Planet Hollywood. SOOO..LOOK OUT! Hopefully by that time, the dogs will be better...
2	QRW2iSHkMSWv6cPf44VIuA	Last time I ate here was when Carl's Jr 1st introduced their $6 burger probably 5 or 6 years ago.  In no way did I wanna eat here but I only have a 30 minute lunch break and I work in Chinatown on Spring Mountain so outside of eating something Asain it's either Church's Chicken or this Carl's Jr. and theres always a line over at Churchs so........  I'm a sucker for NEW so I ordered the from the display advertising Steak sandwich with onion rings on it.  Just a sandwich & a drink $8 no wonder I haven't been back in awhile.  The thing was covered heavy in mayo and had lettuce & tomato-NO onion on a roll with a very thin not so tender piece of meat.  Reminded me of bad bar food.
2	XSfZDA2CPBvGhgOzKcxqg	I probably go here every 6 mos. or so if I'm with a meat eater that is and they have to have In N Out the grilled cheese is consistently good and my kid likes em too, along with the fries that sometimes come w/ a fish taste at no extra charge!! Chocolate shakes are always fun though and most everyone I go with regrets eating the burgers afterwards though they say "Dude that was a good call you had a grilled cheese huhuhuhuuuh I dont feel too great." I'm not big on onions so the animal style stuff doesnt do it for me either sorry folks.   I remember when In N Out came to town GOOD WORD you couldnt even get into the damn place they would have cones up in the parking lot with cops directing traffic. I think its way overrated but they pay the kids that work here more than minimum wage and well the meat eaters need to eat still right!?!
2	WAF32Uyf0vQLJMmWHDMEw	Came here for a birthday dinner and I wasn't impressed with the food. The atmosphere was typical, clean and the staff were friendly. I looked under the hoods (as advised from previous posts) and there were still a couple mildew spots. Tried a smidgen of everything and nothing tasted fresh. Safe to say I didn't go back for seconds on anything and I'm probably not going to be returning unless of course another free meal is being offered. But even then I'll have to really like the person I'm going for!
2	a0ghoYQNDBTJjn1ttuM5Iw	Sorry if this offends anyone.  I can't stand the place.  The only good thing I order is the meatball sub.  Even that could be better but it's filling.  The pizza is really not good at all.  I've ordered there twice thinking maybe the first time was a fluke.  Well, it wasn't.  The pizza turns out soggy even if it's burned.  Yes, they gave me a burned pizza!  The cheese that they use is super cheap and oily.  Good cheese should string if it's fresh and of good quality.  No, not the case at all!  I say, 'don't waste your money!'  Go elsewhere even if it means going to Pizza Hut.
2	4xuhITkzvRCzRfpJU234vg	I had a pretty strange experience at Sababa.  A friend and I arrived around 2pm, so it was after the lunch crowd was gone.  There was one woman eating on a table and there was just one guy running the place (at least that was visible) and he was in front of the counter.  He was a nice guy and gave us each a sample falafel to try.  It was good and we ordered our food.  The food was mediocre and I was really surprised to see that my part of the bill was $17!  I found the place to be overpriced and a little on the bland side.  It made me a little nervous that there was only one guy there and he was taking orders, preparing the food AND handling cash.  I just got a weird vibe from the place in general.
2	tBgIq5QTuT03nBHl64r3g	Why would a local go to a TGI Friday's inside the Orleans... good question.. that was definitely a lapse of judement! Fiance and I were looking for somewhere generic to eat lunch that was inbetween our offices.. I expected reliable, pretty good food  I ordered the turkey burger with cheese. Burger came out without cheese and then the guy proceeded to bring me a cold slice of cheese on a plate when I noticed it had no cheese. The burger was so cold the cheese wouldn't melt.. eww. seriously, throw it on the grill for a minute, how lazy are you? Oh and the bun was stale.. and kept breaking off as I ate it.. and the burger sucked. Nothing good about it. Service was obviously bad too.
2	shV2lz9wYTXPFmNkAMEjlQ	One of the few fast food chains that offers a veggie burger option. They use the Boca patty which is not my favorite.   Pros -Staff is friendly -Offer a veggie burger, turkey burger -Skinny Fries (not diet food but they are cut thinner than steak fries)  Cons -Burgers don't taste that good. My veggie burger was very very lackluster and my friend's beef patty was apparently not a home run either - Price : 11 dollars for a fast food  meal (burger, fries, coke) - Not really fast food if it takes 10 min to get the food  It's going to be a long time before I go to FatBurger again. Not impressive but edible.
4	tP74c37GQkj7tFS3Obw	I was hungry, and Judit was running late, so I ran across E Carson to try out the Real McCoy. What a fantastic little hole in the wall! If you're looking for good, cheap eats, come here. Half (at least 6in, seemed bigger) hoagies start at $3. Three dollars! I think the most expensive one was still less than $4. The menu is limited, but, really, how many sandwich options do you need? The lady running the joint is really sweet, and the whole place has a very home-cooked feel to it. I went with the polish ham and provolone and a side of potato salad, and it cost less than $5. Best part? It actually tasted good. Fresh bread, plenty of ham, sour pickles--yum!  Cash only, and take-out only. No tables or chairs to enjoy your cheap eats.
2	buuhj6g1OtR0EC9rC64aQ	Don't go there. The food is not bad, but it is waaaayy overpriced and the menu doesn't have much selection. You can spend  more than $35 on average Japanese food here and not even be full. For example, the crab cake is $7 and only comes with two small patties.
2	4fybWxcjjJMgGLlKgKZw	Woooooooooo. The fact that Schwartz's in the #1 Montr\u00e9al restaurant on Yelp in horrifying. C'mon guys. You might enjoy to wait 30 minutes for the taste of delicious fat smoked meat, dry rye bread and cherry cola, but Montr\u00e9al has much more to offer than Schwartz's!!! We also have poutine. Just kidding.  I would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day.   I might get killed for saying that.  For a full discussion on the topic: Is Schwartz's overrated?  http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/526634
2	YfXrroTVKvIH0qtDFrpNlg	Everytime I go to Majerle's I leave wondering why I ever went in the 1st place.  The service is BAD most of the time, the bartenders have attitudes & the beer selection is sub par.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because for some reason I wind up going  back, usually to meet friends.  Im never impressed by any part of their service, menu or price structure.   How can up consistently mess up sliders? Yes EVERY TIME. I ran into Thunder Dan once, thats got to be worth somthing right?
4	7l7SF8AirwN6btJFU7LNEw	If you have any experience with Panera, this one is a nice example. No problems with the service or the food, and it's easy to get the nutritional information. I have had a few issues trying to get the wifi to work. One time I left something behind there, and they kept it safe until I returned an hour later. So praise for them on that rare but valued service.
4	gigZ1xJ74pQkiejpNZ4Cw	I heart the King Wah!   Its your typical Chinese take out. Its always consistently good. Its not over the top the best I have ever had, but it is far from the worst.   We always order the sweet and sour chicken (all white meat) and the vegetable low mien with a side of crab puffs and fried wontons.   I have never had one complaint about the food. Its always delivered hot and fast. While I am not huge fan of the crab puffs (I am super picky about my puffs) The Hubs lurvs them!   We are so glad we found out about the Wah, its right down the street and good for those nights you don't feel like cooking.   Tuki gives the SS chicken 4 tails!
2	Zmy1IPGyH9WyFB9XTDr3iA	Originally me and a friend were going next door to eat at Genghis Grill really quick before hitting up a movie, but the buffet line was incredibly long due to a couple of little league teams and we were pressed for time.  We both were in the mood for something asian-y so we decided to try this place out (right next door)  We had both the chicken and beef teriyaki....no taste at all.  Required a lot of soy sauce and chili sauce to get anything out of it.  If I hadn't watched the dude make it, I would've thought he forgot to put any sauce in it.  The meat seemed pretty low quality as well.  The only thing they had going was that the veggies were really fresh, but that's about it.    I agree with Kevin C...it felt and tasted like we were in the food court at Fiesta.  We were the only people there, while Genghis next door was packed...not sure how this place will stay in business with something so similar and way more popular next door.
2	FCSMXA6bPmsOVXYw1vlNw	I don't like Sushi, so I was doomed from the minute I walked through the door here.  I asked the waiter what is the best thing to have for a first-time sushi experience,... he laughed in my face and told me I was in the wrong place. How rude!!  My brothers loved the sushi, they actually like it, I hated it. I left feeling hungry and cheated. It's a nice place, but just not my cup of tea.
4	uRU8qXdNamgz6fmhFL8ZA	AWESOME HANG OVER FOOD.   good drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices.  The service is cool.    Note that there is smoking inside so you'll either a. love that information or b. hate that information.
4	g8w132zgUuTKPiDtIsfS6A	Shortly after arriving at our hotel after a 7 hour drive, the Wife and I decided to go grab a quick bit for dinner.  The deli was only a mile away and gave the opportunity to get something simple and quick.    Now, the area that it was in is not that great, and the strip mall seems to be dying a slow death.  And the place looked like a dive.  But you know what, the Ham and cheese pita I got tasted great.  And it came with a side of fries for $4.50  And it's not like they skimped on the meat or anything.  There was a good inch of ham in that pita.    If you're in the mood for a quick lunch sandwich, you can't go wrong with this place.  Just don't go after dark.
4	mldH1yIFkZx5Wi8zloBSuw	I always feel like I'm back in school b/c it looks and feels like a cafeteria when you first walk in.  You actually get a tray and stand in line while picking out food that servers place on plates for you.  They have a wide selection of southern comfort food though.  The usual fried chicken, fried pork chops, fried fish (catching the trend), collared greens, cabbage, macaroni and cheese, etc.  They do have about three or four selection of salad to choose from (Cesar, Spinach, Garden).  I always end of looking over everything, holding up the line, and then end of getting what I usually get...Baked Spaghetti w/ yams or Sweet Potato Souffle. Theirs a lot more sides to choose from (can't mention them all) and they usually change up every other day.  At the end of the line is a choice of desserts and beverages.  Between the two of us we end up spending about $13 - $16 together for everything (I guess it just depends on how hungry you are b/c everything is individually prices)
2	7UBudywlZnuheVmYoE4LwA	Ladies and Drag Queens beware, the "sandbar" actually has sand outside. Not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels. I work very close to the Sandbar on friday nights after work alot (10-15) of people from my work go there. I have been there quite a few times but not somewhere I would encourage someone to go. I have had some of the food, minichimis are ok, tasty when you are drunk but it's no substitute for Jack in The Box tacos at 2 in the morning.  There are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins't one of them.
2	kIfVdmWDWAHos3l7QyIpA	I've been to Black Bears throughout California and this one was not nearly as good as the others.    The biscuits were hard and dry and I just was not that happy with our breakfast here.   The portions are still crazy big but the quality of food and what you pay more just aren't what I had expected.    If you are going to be a chain restaurant of sorts, everything should be consistent and this location is definitely not compared to others....
4	hjGh8Bb4bej3jSThD0dbVA	Sweet and Sour pork and Beef with Broccoli is outstanding.  The Garlic chicken is good too.  Had to up the stars because two was really unfair after one dish.  Service is super fast and you won't find a much better price!  I'll keep ordering for a long, long time!
2	j8hrNttZpxekt9KCMvFuoQ	Here's the deal - I live nearby and often walk over with my young son for breakfast...he loves the planes and I get some exercise. Now I have read all of these reviews and know exactly what and who each person is commenting on - it's funny because I have felt the same way on a few occasions!   Go there for a breakfast special of 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast - all for under 5.00 bucks - order water & watch the planes! That is it!! By all means DO NOT order anything else on that menu!! DO NOT eat the numerous buffets, fish frys, prime rib, or any other coupons specials they entice you with - YOU WILL REGRET IT! Nasty!  Again, the best and only value is the cheap two egg special and watch the planes with the kids (I'm lucky because my boy like the special too) ...anything else here is a punishment.  PS - The service seems to have gotten a little better lately .... however, it was so bad before, just stopping by your table now seems like a blessing...It's a shame - this place could be soooo cool if they just tried a little...
4	LxSvH1WlAqFlNBs2do9Ew	Been coming here for YEARS (close to a decade).... still not sick of it.  I stick with the steak tacos, although burritos are good.    Definitely "authentic mexicans" working here, without a doubt.  A lot of them don't speak the best english, so it's good to make sure you either a) tell them what you want in Spanish or b) repeat your order SEVERAL TIMES.  I had issues with them always putting onions on my tacos/burritos but now have it down to a science the best way to prevent this.  They tend to be a little forgetful and don't have fancy taco-bell-style video screens showing each order, so you gotta have a strategy if you're picky about your toppings.  Definitely not the best, and not really cheap either, but ... I'm hooked.  Open ridiculously late every night, too.
2	LPkiCXieeLWEd9hYIWG50Q	Pizza was good but expensive. ...small Chicago style for $15...filling for sure...not much service...pizza took 30 minutes but came out not very hot....no one came out to even see if i needed anything else......no beer served here....sodas came out in cans. No atmosphere. I wont be back.
2	AQ9PSdSDkrPqdG44oyBUA	We'd heard good things about Symposium but ended up leaving quite underwhelmed. The service was extremely slow -- we waited almost an hour for our food to arrive (even though the place was far from packed), and then ended up waiting another 30 minutes after we got our bills for the waitress to bring the card machine over.   One of the other servers was quite rude when we first arrived as well.   The food itself was okay -- it tasted good, but was definitely not worth an hours wait.
2	tWvu4cJgWSpvXaLtNVQA	Really not great. Went with 3 other people and none of us really liked any of the dishes. It was like all of the dishes lacked any depth to the flavors to make them interesting. I thought a long time about just ignoring this place and not reviewing it because its independently owned and others seem to like it so much however I just wanted to put it out there what we ate was blah.
4	BibXVDVJLyJeVP9GOJTf1Q	This place is surprisingly cozy and inviting, and the Middle Eastern food is delicious.   It's located in the strip of shops next to the Harris Teeter at Kenilworth Commons so don't miss it when you drive by.  The veggie platter/combo entree is my favorite thing to order- it's huge and it comes with about 8 different items and pita bread.  My boyfriend really likes the pita wraps and the potato harra.  The only negative I have about this place is that it isn't cheap- entrees are mainly $10 or more and the sandwiches are $6, but they don't come with a side.  If you are willing to spend a little bit of money this place is a refreshing change of pace.  Oh, and they have a belly dancer on Friday night.
4	JL9CywEDsbH2vZ7R1CKXA	I've been to Mimi's numerous times and the meals and service often have been mediocre. However, I give this particular Mimi's four stars because of the excellent service my family received on our recent visit. Our waitress was perfectly attentive -- not too bothersome, with just the right amount of "popping-in" time to make sure we were happy and content. What sealed the four-star deal was when we left and my sister and I forgot our take-out boxes, our waitress ran out to us to bring them to us.  I was so impressed!  That has NEVER happened.  I give hundreds of kudos to good service, and this was definitely one of those cases.  Oh, and the other great thing about Mimi's: their to-die-for French onion soup.  It's AWESOME!
2	Rg4wZ7Q0OADiQcv5jdLeWQ	i am definitely not a fan of orient express. the food is just ok and the boba is disgusting. the tapioca balls served as this place are hard as rock. i might have to add that i am an asian originally from southern ca, where asian food (or generally, food) is just better overall- but i am definitely not impressed with this place. i would rather go to lulu's anyday. however, the review below mine should concentrate more on the specifics of orient express, rather than an attack on asian culture.
4	sjxgQ5LDFxD4tky4dBnpg	Met up with friends before dinner, got talked into one if their famous Long Island iced teas. Not usually a fan, but these were remarkable! Dangerous really in that you can't taste the alcohol.  So good I had 2!  They had a small selection of WI beers too.  Only take cash..looked like there was a fryer and grill for food, but we didn't have any.
2	SFpdsBAfxriDR3gS8I3Xw	I agree with most of the other reviews about this place.  The food is ok at best and the service is a complete cluster fuq.  The value of the food is ok because they give you a decent amount for the price.  It is all just a bit dry and bland.  The service is very helpful and apologetic when something goes wrong, but it really doesn't help because everything was slow.  You almost feel bad because they are very nice, but really don't know what is going on.  The absolute best part of going here was that the establishment was an old 5 & Diner that went out of business.  It was a trip seeing all of the 5 & Diner decor but now with Mediterranean music being played in the background and people eating hummus at the milk shake counter.  All-in-all I'm glad I went there to try it out, but probably won't go back.
2	1IHkXTBrfdxh39FAjWBEg	We walked into Creelers late evening on Easter Sunday because it was one of the few restaurants in the area still serving food at that hour. The place has a tiny, cozy bistro-ish feel to it which was nice.  The prices are pretty expensive, though; but to be fair the more expensive entrees appeared to be more complex. I got the pate (which is a starter on the menu) and a side of ratatouille, which came out to about 10 pounds total. The pate and ratatouille were really delicious, but tiny in portion. Luckily, I wasn't that hungry. For the food and price, I'd say it was an average experience.
2	kfbgtNxtuwIyLumkF2xwDg	Greasy food, just like you'd expect a diner to be.  I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich and had to keep wiping my hands as I ate it.  For a dollar more instead of fries I got onion rings - onions with heavy batter similar to those you get frozen at the grocery store. Cute diner atmosphere, but when the jukebox plays, watch out - it is LOUD.
2	xFD1MMlYbX3XXQuVLf2TCQ	Crazy decor!  Felt like I was in the mushroom level from Mario Sunshine.  Service was quick, but the food is very blah.  Entrees were about $15-20 each - For the price you pay, you can get much better food elsewhere, considering the availability of Asian restaurants throughout all the Vegas hotels.  We ordered two noodle dishes and the fishcake small plate - all were quite oily and lacking in flavor.  Would not go back - did not satiate my Asian food fix nor my hunger.
2	9Qb9r7tA4w2KvSinRzvDw	I adore, love, crave, & dream about good Greek food.  That being said, I just don't enjoy My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. (And I really hate when people just call it My Big Fat..how appetizing is that??)  My biggest problem is with the pita. I mean, really, you're a Greek restaurant, you should at the VERY least have good pitas. They taste straight out of the store-bought bag. After that, there really is no redemption.  The menu is very chain standard, and is good for families with kids and big groups. It's definitely good for people with big appetites because their portion sizes are out of control.  There are better restaurants in the area for sure, even better restaurants right there in the AZ Center.
4	HkAVcUU0FK4aUm5uHPbp9g	Yes, the food is good.  Excellent.  5 stars  But I have to say the atmosphere is a little underwhelming, hence the knock down a star.  I really prefer Harvest next door better. But I understand a real foodie would love this place more.
2	YsXFGpKKJpNdv700wLVEg	Meh, is right on this review. Girl and I ordered pizza from here for delivery.  We asked for marinara on the side. We received cold tomato sauce from a can. Cheese Pizza was just average. I am thankful they were 24hrs. and close but I would not recommend this place at this time based on "MY" quality taste test. Villa's rocks!
4	vTF42GlC49lRPlaMSADitA	This was a great first experience staff was friendly. Got great service, and the food was good.  The burger I had was nice and fresh and was a great value for the price. And to make it even more awesome,  is they give you a cookie with your bill. Oh and it may look like a dive, but it is very nice and clean inside.
4	s2rH85zoZ3cXVUTwqYIJnw	Hey, it's your basic small-town bar, just outside the city.  One plus is they have a solid selection of bottled beers, more than a typical dive.  The menu is very simple and basic, but the food is done well and very cheap.  You get your basics like burgers and grilled ham sandwiches (served on a big Coney, weird but good).  The only sides are bagged basic chips.  Service is quick but not overtly friendly, not rude either.  Typical burger/sandwich with chips is only $4.50.  So overall it lives up to everything a dive should do--cheap good basic food.  I'd go again.  Oh, but CASH only!  No cards accepted.
4	5x9revyoKZvnFJbmbmmTDg	We've been visiting MIL in Apache Junction for 15+ years and I wish I would have known about this place before.  It's family style dining and all you can eat.  Great for large groups.  The ribs are awesome, the ham is very tasty, the chicken and stuffing is OK.  The gift shop is big enough to spend a little time walking off some of the dinner and you might find some little Western do-dad to add to your collection of do-dads.
4	SOjgjWKnI8F1IlrXic0Lw	Food tasted fine, service was good.  Lindos doesn't have a fancy bone it's body even my coffee cup was scratched but I liked it.   I got the breakfast sampler for $7.99 :two eggs , home fries, pancakes and french toast, and bacon.  The french toast was very good fluffy and sweet.  I would have really liked if they cooked the homefries with green pepper and onions but they were tender and I ate them all.  You can have both french toast and pancakes but I opted for french toast only.   I learned that Lindos does a breakfast buffet on Sundays from 8pm-1pm.  There was a Steeler pride omelet on the menu too.   I also saw a special  for 10 wing dings and fries for $6.50.    Great place for cheap eats.   This would be a great place to fill up before a Steeler game.
4	QvtHevpCaEqWe0xzBgWoQ	Surprised by the negative reviews, as we live in the neighborhood and have eaten here for ten years.  And we are not bluehairs.  :)  I will admit that breakfast is their strength, the rest of the food is pretty basic diner fare, but good portions, nice homemade soups, decent prices, and we find it to be consistently tasty.  Any out of town guests don't consider their weekend a success without a trip here for pancakes.  Give it a try, don't expect gourmet, organic, or fancy and you shouldn't be disappointed.
2	UoaXFgPjjFZUGGsARd79Zw	The restaurant is located on the second floor of Pacific Asian Plaza, almost adjacent to Hue's Sandwiches.  There were only 6 customers on this Thursday evening which had me a bit concerned, but we are operating under strict orders to seek out new restaurants so we made do.  We shared orders of roti canai (Malaysian/Indian bread served with curry chicken as a dipping sauce),  Penang satay (marinated and grilled chicken skewers with peanut sauce), nasi lemak (coconut rice flavored with cloves and screwpine leaves served with chili anchovy curry chicken and hard boiled egg) and kari ayam (chicken and potatoes with red curry in coconut mild curry).  The roti, satay and nasi lemak were all very good, but the curries were largely indistinguishable.
2	tu0IJSoA9BWl25Up3icA	While Dunn's smoked meat is definitely good - i really hate this particular location. The service is awful. The french fries are often cold. You're stuck either ordering a platter (which is way too much for lunch and given this location lunch is their main meal) or a sandwich without the fries/coleslaw/pickle.  Why are onion rings over $6? I want a SMALL portion  with my sandwich. It's really nice that you leave the ketchup and mustard bottles on the table, i have to ask for mayonnaise (and we're in Quebec - this is pretty standard) and the mustard is cheap.  So - have Dunn's at another location where the service is better. Wait, go to Schwartz's.
4	0ORHZBT1Q2guUYlsVK23nA	Many people don't know it, but even though Barro's is a chain you'll see in various locations, it's a LOCAL chain, family owned and operated.  They established here in Phoenix circa 1984 (i think it was) and have grown and expanded all over AZ quite successfully ever since.  The best pizza in town, even if service is a little inconsistent.
2	kDlrnf14ld85w64WysqQ9g	Not bad, but not great either. Their pizzas are NY style and quite large, but the one we ordered came cut strangely (into a bunch of tiny square pieces? very odd). Wasn't terribly impressed with the toppings either- their mushrooms are the canned variety and it was light on the meat.  Ultimately I'd prefer it to chain delivery, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving a pizza. There are better places around.
2	KS0QiYTfYO5oTZ5cl762g	I really wanted Tropical Smoothie but the line was out the door and since they're pretty slow normally and I'm short on time I decided to pop into the empty Pizza Hut two doors down. BAD IDEA!  It was $10 for a medium hand tossed cheese only pizza. They can't do small unless it's the deep dish crust. Here's the kicker, it was a 20 minute wait! I would have been better off waiting in the line at Tropical Smoothie for a cheaper, healthier, quicker bite to eat. NEVER AGAIN!
2	WvRY3GbYOxdZXFJUWOLQ	You know, every once in a while I go to an establishment where I have conflicting feelings from 2 of my personalities. Overall, I feel that I'm a pretty laid back guy who isn't incredibly sophisticated and doesn't sweat the small stuff. However, I feel that I definitely draw the line at a certain point- and that point today was that I prefer not to enter an establishment whose baristas serve tea and goodies barefoot. I'm going to set the stage here. I've wanted to stop in this place for quite a while. I was enjoying the beautiful weather today and I got my bike out and decided to head over there. I walked in and immediately enjoyed the place: it was very anti-establishment, a nice and cozy non-profit shop (I think it's run by volunteers)- and sat down to enjoy a great cup of lavender tea. I even walked around and perused a couple sections of the small library of books. It wasn't until I sat down that I noticed that the guy behind the counter was barefoot. At first I simply tilted my head out of curiosity, but the more I thought about it the more it bothered me. I wouldn't say I'm a stickler for the rules, but this has to be breaking some health code. At one point this guy even walked to the bathroom and back. As much as I want for this not to be a big deal to me, I just can't get past it. Just as I was about to write a glowing 4-star review of this place, the horror and image of the bare feet and all of the amazingly intricate battles my two selves were having came to mind (and they involved communities of bacteria from the toilet seat rearing their ugly heads into my cup of tea). Sorry guys, maybe anarchism wasn't as cool (or clean) as I originally thought.
4	Ow05Qnjlqf4aUtixjSXVQ	Several years ago I was a regular at Taylor's Chowder House, then moved away. I remember the food being quite good which was why we kept coming back.   I had the extreme pleasure to drop by for lunch 2 days before Christmas. I was greeted with the odor of cigarette smoke, likely from the American Legion. Don't those folks know that smoking can be hazardous to your health? Anyway, Taylor's offered their annual  Holiday Chowder. This is one of the most rich and delectable chowders I have ever consumed. It consisted of their regular New England with just a few extras, cod, salmon, brandy, shrimp, and most anything else you can think of.  There just is no way to top this chowder, other than with crackers.   It is a bit pricey. But it is the food you are buying and that is worth it.
4	7c1z9uQwHc1U33P6T74Jw	Yet another gem I have discovered as I eat my way through my new neighborhood!  My bf and I went here on a Friday night at about 1 am, after a little bit of drinking because we were starving.  The first thing I noticed, the beautiful dessert case that lures you in as soon as you step in the door.  So many cakes, pies, brownies, cheesecake....agggghhhhh.  So tempting!  The next standout is by far the gigantic, atlas-sized menu that has about anything you could possibly want on it.  We eliminated certain pages that we knew we didn't want and narrowed it down from there.  It's definitely a daunting task!  I went with 3 cheese mannicotti and my bf had roast turkey with gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  The portions were HUGE!!!  And very reasonably priced.  The food came out really fast and while it was not the best mannicotti I've ever had, it was damn tasty and the tomato sauce was right on.  The best part about my meal, however, was by far the pineapple coconut cake I had for dessert.  Oh My God....I cannot tell you how yummy this slice of sugary heaven was.  Light and airy, with layers of pineapple filling.....mmmmmmmm.  Bf had strawberry cheesecake and it was not good.  It was too thick and the strawberries had no flavor.....my suggestion, eat the cake!
2	MkvkybwWY6QaH8cUuOObA	So I felt like Thai and decided to check out this place.   I'm giving two stars because of the chunky peanut sauce which was delicious.   We order pad thai and fresh veggie spring rolls.  Now I've never had tofu in the rolls so I was surprised for a minute but didn't phase me when I was examining it.... then I took a bite and there was this taste that I couldn't not shake.  I started taking out all the tofu because it was unbearable and I'm not a huge fussy guy but I couldn't take it at all, like the taste was just bad.... real bad!   The pad thai came and I could smell the tofu, THAT tofu before to taste it and I was like 'maybe I'm imagining things'. So I took a bite and there it was BAM in my mouth.   I literally took 2 bites and asked for the bill because 'that taste was all up in there'.  Never tasted tofu like that before and I actually thought tofu was tasteless... Guess not*  Service was good and fast and the chunky peanut sauce was great.  Hope others have a better experience.
2	b3KRSzwQlvjrp3LSs05eQQ	Came here on a Tues and was fairly disappointed in the food and service.   We sat on the outdoor patio and the waiter only poked his head out every now and then. I got the Mexican Benedict and the portions were very big. First bite was great but it quickly became apparent that it wasn't fresh breakfast potatoes and when the benny cooled, it was unpleasant to eat.  Don't think I would ever return.
4	gOsb6keIDYeIjv3yJzkA	Flight cancelled. Stuck in a hotel. Bankers Raw Bar to the rescue! They delivered my Reuben sandwich and strawberry shortcake in just a few minutes. The food was really great. And, they thought of everything from extra napkins to whipped cream!
4	DS0xafrHpHBp6voi4QV3yA	Cool local bar that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The hipsters were not particularly in evidence, just some Sunday night regulars.  The beer selection is pretty rockin', although my stout wasn't that great.  There's an Iron Man pinball machine, and an upstairs area I didn't check out.   Would definitely come back if I'm in Pittsburgh again - would love to check out some live music.
2	YVVx5XsZniiDgmBXazfLvw	I ordered delivery since I just moved to Henderson from Spring Valley and was trying to establish a new pizza place. I read the reviews but thought it can't be that bad. Ordered a cheese pizza with sausage my kids thought was good. I would have tried it but I was so disappointed with the salty philly cheese with the hard to chew bread. The wings were overcooked. The fries were ok. I should have stuck with Dominos.
2	5zKXXc4hPMh0HIN9u3fGg	We would of never known of this place if it weren't for Veebow. That app on my smart phone map'd it out from where I was, it had a buy one burger get second off, sounded like a deal so we went.......  Pros: The food was good.  Cons: We went first thing when it opened, and our food took forever(over 40 mins) for a couple of burgers. Waitress hardly came by our table, understanable since it was the lunch rush. There was no lunch rush.  Verdict: I would have to try it again, hopefully they have another coupon on that Veebow site next month. Can't judge a restaurant off one bad waitress. Next time maybe dinner.
4	t8ZmTSRXizMoReDTrKBFw	This is a bar and grill in the same vein as a PTs or similar.  Tables scattered around a bar which is surrounded by video poker playing patrons.  TVs flash various sports games and news channels.  It's somewhere you go for a quick bite if you live in the neighborhood.  I used to work by this location and a co-worker and I ended up here at least once a week for lunch.  The menu was exactly what you'd expect - chicken fingers, club sandwiches, hamburgers - and I never had anything I didn't like.  The service though was always, always great.  Our orders were taken promptly and our meal was delivered quickly and when you're on a lunch break that's pretty much all you need.  However, they were really nice as well.  Their service set them apart from all the cookie-cutter places just like it.
2	7GUvoZB4SAKmBSQG5TYsiw	menu is fairly lacking, even for an irish pub, and a bit overpriced, but maybe they have to be to make the rent...although they seem to make it up in booze sales.  staff was a bit rude and non-existant at times, but not much else around hre for irish pubs.  the guiness was good, but hard to screw that up I guess!
2	1osKxAdgnksR4uD6DpAg	After much consideration, I decided my previous rating unfairly portrayed Vinery. That 3-star rating was heavily influenced by ambiance and vision, two very important aspects of a restaurant. When applied to the food, not just the space in which the food is served. I'm not giving up on Vinery, but rather challenging them to rise above the mediocrity that was apparent in our meal. Trust me, I will be back. And when Vinery has developed its standing in the downtown foodie destination guide I'll be proud of how far it's come along. Until then... ====================================================  Such a difficult place to review, because I see so much potential. It's a great location, tucked into an awesome neighborhood. The interior is intimate and has some great cosmetic touches. I like the idea of having the kitchen behind the counter, so you are right there in the action. Service is good, without the annoying hovering, and isn't rushed so this lends itself nicely to a slow meal to enjoy as much as possible. The complimentary sangria is pretty good (however, Dottsy's Slap me Silly Sangria has lifted the bar rather high). And offering a four-course Monday night meal for $10 is brilliant in any economic situation. Plus, they have a tapas menu.   And now, the ubiquitous "but."   But: Egg rolls shouldn't collapse on themselves from over frying. The slaw was good, but the egg roll could have been removed from the fryer several minutes earlier.   But: English cucumbers are one of my favorites, however they don't have such a long shelf live. Mixed with vine-ripened tomatoes is a great idea; however, bringing some zing with feta cheese and a light sprinkling fresh dill and a splash of balsamic would really bring this salad to life. Perhaps I'm partial to the hummus I make and Crazy Jim's pita bread, so I'll leave it at that...   But: Skirt steak should never be used for anything other than fajitas, cooked fast and hard. This is not a good cut of meat to have wrapped around a starch. Possibly fresh asparagus...but, leave it in the fajita mix. The rice was entirely too over-seasoned, even for a saltaholic like me.   But: Merchant Services can be just as much your friend as your enemy. Americans use credit cards for $1 purchases, so certainly we would use them for dining out. Not having a working CC machine puts your customers in a very awkward situation. Granted, there is relatively close access to ATMs and even the Circle K. But, if you have to send your customers away to pay for their meal, are you really accomplishing much?   There's a reason I front loaded this review with everything but the actual food--this is the part of the puzzle that keeps Vinery 214 Bistro from launching into space and being a stellar dining attraction. Ideally, this is a two-star restaurant, with the emphasis being on potential ability. For now, I've decided 2.5 stars is generous, and rounded that up to three. I'll be back, trust me. But I'm hoping that the menu is reevaluated, tweaked, reinvested and solidly delivered in this beautifully packaged restaurant.
2	kqrWSohmewZ9xEaj5oZejg	Ok I had a tamale at the annual Glendale Jazz Blues Fest, I did not actually go inside the place. But the red chili tamale I had was bland and dry with shredded beef brisket at both ends but none in the middle!  Where was the red chili? They offered no salsa with their tamales either and sold no drinks outside their business. The set up nor the tamale did nothing for their image.
4	vl1XMefZtQhr9UEbVKXgIA	I'd only been there a couple of times before but they remembered my name and what I liked to drink. Pretty good in my book. I guess it's like a local bar, but downtown. I'll be back the next time I'm in Phoenix.
4	eGIsurU67wGj44R6AmFHg	We had dessert & coffee here on Valentine's Day.  Not sure I would normally come here but we specifically came to see the lovely & talented Judy Roberts on the ivories and were delighted by her vocal accompanist, the enchanting Margot Reed.  That duo rocks our socks!  JUDY! JUDY!! JUDY!!!
2	aRu2X5uy6n6Htel9FuxduA	What was I thinking? I should have known better then go to a place like this, to eat a breakfast sandwich while I was waiting for my flight to go home.  Auntie Anne's is known for their pretzels, and that's what I should have gotten for breakfast, but when I saw the sign for a $4.99 breakfast sandwich, I thought it was cheap enough to give it the good ol' college try!  Auntie Anne's sells two types of breakfast sandwiches........  1. Bacon & Egg Breakfast Sandwich 2. Sausage & Egg Breakfast Sandwich  After purchasing two breakfast sandwiches, and two coffees which came out to $15.95...........I realized the food & coffee was just plain lousy!   I give the friendly clerk an A+ for his customer service, as when I walked up to the counter to order my breakfast sandwiches, there were 2 sandwiches under the heat lamp. After ordering my sandwiches.......he had grabbed both sandwiches under the heat lamp, but after the other clerk bought out some new sandwiches..........he promptly threw away the breakfast sandwiches sitting under the heat lamp, and gave me two fresh breakfast sandwiches which came freshly out of whatever they do to reheat the items.  The breakfast sandwiches.........they sucked! I give it a solid "1" for the grub.........the bun was hard, and the egg was very rubbery. I had the Egg & Bacon breakfast sandwich, and barely tasted any bacon. The coffee was weak too........but of course, I wasn't expecting Starbucks son!  Had to bump it up a star for the good customer service.............but if you come here, just stick with the pretzels.........I'm sure that's what they specialize in.
2	iq5tmME31xniYPGn54bUg	We had dined at this restaurant several times and mostly enjoyed the food. However, I take out experience was a complete disaster. We called and ordered our meals and was told it would be 30 minutes. I waited almost 45 minutes before arriving at the restaurant and then had to sit there for an additional half an hour before my food is ready. Other then apologizing, it was no attempt to explain, to rectify, or to somehow make this a better experience. I kept being told to just take a seat and wait. When I arrived home, only one dish was hot. All of the other dishes, appetizers and dosas, were ice cold. The ratings are for our dining experience. Our take-out experience would've been a half star.
4	XmjsVuYt71MIGGGJJCGuA	I have been a Tony's regular for over 30 years.  I have never had a bad meal.  My husband loves the #3, chili relleno, beef taco, rice and beans, I get the #1, tostado, taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  The restaurant is small, but huge compared to what it was when it opened about 40 years ago.  It is a family owned business, sometimes Tony is there, just sitting at a table, he doesn't work there any longer due to age and health.  My daughter in Iowa insists on eating there numerous times when she comes home for a visit.  It is not the fancy, lettuce covered mexican type food that you find at places like Macayo's or Garcia's, just good, traditional mexican food.  The quesadillas are the best as are the chips and salsa!
2	F0KdyX9idFXykKBm9Neb7w	"Tourist trap" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more.
2	JnUXfKE3jz2K8RWk8C9eWw	I arrived to CLT at 5am from Denver and walked right past Bojangles (would never normally think to eat there). While sitting in the USAir club thinking how breakfast options are terrible at this airport, I jumped onto yelp. After reading reviews, I made the trek down at 7am on a Saturday. Pretty good line formed (about 9 deep) but I'd say it only took 4-5 minutes until I had ordered and received my order!    Biscuits were pretty decent. Sausage and gravy biscuit was also good at the time. Cajun chicken I tried too but didn't seem very breakfast like, but was of alright quality for a fast food airport joint.  After about an hour though, I sure felt like crud.  I never have stomach problems from food - but this one sure made me feel somewhat sick on my next two flights.  Will not return.  Not worth it, especially when flying and either way the food is NOT good for you at all.
2	gQf96eFPIR0Htuf7KA	I had been to this restaurant before on holidays and for lunch with family and solo, so after using the spa's services, I decided to have lunch (July 2, 2014) before heading to my next meeting. The hostess seated me at the first table. A few other tables were still occupied and being served. She gave me a menu and told me a server would be right with me. The waitress kept coming over to the other tables asking diners about drink refills and totally ignored me! Didn't even explain that the table was not hers. Didn't get the waiter whose table it was for me. After 10 minutes, I finally got the attention of the hostess (at this point I was about to just get up and leave) and she seemed surprised I hadn't been waited on although she was only a few feet away. She took my drink order and got the bartender to come over and take my order. I thought perhaps this waitress was over booked until two couples came in and sat down at the empty table next to me. This waitress immediately came over to them and was very friendly -- taking their drink order and telling them specials (which I was never told). Their food came out the same time as mine. I paid my bill and when I got up to leave and bring the tip to the bartender ( to ensure she didn't get it), she says "Have a nice day, M'am" -- NOW she notices me? Needless to say, it was a humiliating experience. I am a business woman who frequently takes clients out to lunch and dinner, but I will NEVER again come to this restaurant alone or with family or friends. NOTE: I didn't give this review the lowest rating because the food was good -- not great, but good.
4	eVSgaPp7eadSij9LU15XtQ	Ever since this Papa John's expanded it's delivery area I have been ordering on a regular basis.  Calling in ,the person taking the order has always made a point of reading it back, including dipping cup substitutions and specific delivery door instructions.  Delivery people have always been very friendly, to the point that when my regulars see my address they make a point of double checking to make sure we have all the dipping cups just as requested.  Delivery time is always at stated time period or faster.  The crust is thick and fluffy, the toppings ample and evenly distributed, and the cheese supplying full coverage.  The only keeping it from 5 stars is every once in a while some garlic and marinara cups slip by my only cheese cups request.
2	TMC31shyZEkKmM6y0SVDg	For a sports bar it is mediocre.  If you're not looking for a sports bar to watch a game, don't even bother, (you should probably start reading the names of restaurants).  There is ample seating, but to me almost feels like a large cafeteria.  Both nights I've been were very quiet, maybe the location, I am not sure.  We ordered your typical sports bar food, nachos, wings, mozza sticks, (yum), and of course draft beers...  The positives are that it is plenty large enough for a big group, TVs in view from anywhere you sit, you don't have to get dressed up, and they speak fluent French.
2	zYUfkoOadaBJ58f3kw	Tonight was my 2nd or 3rd time at this location. Its part of a Texaco gas station and has a drive thru. I ordered at the counter because I needed gas anyway. Tuesday night is their 99 cent leg and thigh special so I got one of those. I also saw a sign for a 2 pc mixed and a biscuit for 2.49. I asked what the pieces were for that combo and the cashier told me Breast and wing, so I ordered one as well. Well I got home and had 2 legs and 2 thighs in my bag along with a biscuit.  Did some quick math, and 2 of the 99 cent specials + 89 cents for a biscuit would of only set me back 2.87 instead of the 3.48 I was charged for the same thing.    Anyway, the chicken was pretty greasy. I've had better from the SW location near where I moved from. I will probably return at some point because it's right across the street from where I work and it's an easy stop otw home without going out of my way at all. They have good prices and a special everyday, so it's fairly economical.
2	g8Pa5nfciRlfAh0LdKOw	Last weekend we decided to try this new sushi place called Sushi Club. The atmosphere seems nice, it's modern clean and decorated with several flat screens throughout the restaurant.  They offer all you can eat sushi for only $19.95 which is a great deal if you compare other places like Sushimon or Wonder Sushi. However, after looking at the all you can eat offerings, you realize that there is only sushi, hand rolls and rolls in the available list. No appetizers, no desserts, no side dishes.  It would have been fine if the sushi were great, however, they were not. We practically ordered every sushi in the menu and most were not that great. In many of them, the rice was excessive and the fish was not that fresh. They had amaebi (sweet shrimp) in the menu, but when it arrived, it turned out to be normal cooked shrimp!   There were about 4 sushi chefs there and I think only 1 was Asian, while there rest were "amigos'. Needless to say, we were disappointed. For $26, you could go to nearby Sushimon which offer much better selection and more items, including appetizers, desserts and side dishes. Or, if you really want good sushi, try Osaka located in the next shopping center.
4	yxFGJFJZTvKKhDaFR2896g	My friend and I just had one slice of cheese pizza. It's pretty good except cheese was at a little saltier side. And we waited more than 5 min, which was the time frame that the order is going to be ready according the guy who took our order.   Second best pizza in Oakland next to Pizza Prima.
4	EpJYovK6L4lHgz2g6OPp6A	We have ordered from this place several times and the food has been great every time.  We really feel the dinner for two meal combo is the best bang for your buck and they allow me to substitute my curry chicken in there.  Being in Centennial and not having much to choose from around here....I think it's a great option for Chinese food.  And the delivery time has always been pretty standard--usually 30-45 minutes.
2	WuxUSwHiQeMW7pZ2uR5ajA	Sorry guys. I have been going to this Wendy's since the place opened years ago. Last few visits keep me from even wanting to go. Let's see if I can update this review soon. Up the quality control and training
2	A3fmWsWZCXX702WmGk9cg	I live across the street pretty much and love me some pb but hate the parking lot in that little strip and can't say I like this one the best the food at this one is just ok. Love the peach tea though could drink it all the time.
2	oTiyOXINjpOErme8jbQUA	This pizza is completely terrible. The service is garbage as well. On the plus side, there is hot sauce and it isn't terribly expensive.   If you are completely stoned out of your mind, this is perfect. Also, a better pizza cannot be found in the pizza desert known as Montr\u00e9al. This city is to pizza what hell is to soft breezes.
4	ZJK2UoJ0ZSqkNzO96hVFGw	I randomly found this place through a couple of friends and it has become one of my FAVORITE Chinese restaurants in AZ. I have driven WAY out of my way to have a taste of there Honey Shrimp. Their cream cheese ragoons A-MAZING and have to order a whole batch for myself. This is no Pei Wei-type fancied-up type pf place. This place is all about the food.
4	zggE1GpRubWtiOew1BT7Q	I wanted to try this place for a while, but they close at 9 everyday and I only crave pizza usually after a beer or two.  Made it for lunch because of Nick's $5.06 lunch and was pleasantly suprized by the Za.  The place is very, very simple.  I expected a more boutique pizza, but for the money this is good thin crust pizza with a tangy sauce and good cheese.    They could dress it up a bit, but then it wouldn't be so cheap!  I will go back and try the baked sandwiches and calzones soon.
4	VudO4QAFxUWRP63IleagQ	This is one more positive Panda Express experience. As a regular Panda Express customer, I realize that they are the Target of fast food places. Panda Express is a fast food restaurant with the ambiance of casual dining, at a price that is not much more than the burger places.   Today I tried their potato chicken. It is different.   Panda Express has one of the cutest mascots: Tom Tom the panda bear. This location features a neat display of the panda bears.    The employees are friendly. One of them was telling me about the panda bears display, and that some locations sell the stuffed panda bear    I was glad to see that they brought back the eggplant with tufu.   What I also enjoy about this Panda Express is that it shares a parking lot with Best Buy and Starbucks.     I give this Panda Express, and many other locations 4-stars.
2	NgVVUFq1FUQn7rk8yaUNWg	This place has reasonable prices, generous portions, fast service, and is very conveniently located (for me!).  That said, convenience isn't quite enough to make me want to come back here.  I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and some vegetable lo mein.  Granted, I have never had Ma Po Tofu.  I'm not really sure what it's "supposed" to taste like.  But what I got from China Garden was SALTY.  So very salty, to the point where I could barely taste any other flavor.  BLEH.  Also, there was a piece of shrimp shell in my Ma Po Tofu....weird.  The vegetable lo mein was pretty good, but honestly that's kind of hard to completely mess up.  My boyfriend had the boneless spare ribs combo.  His eggroll was downright gross.  The insides were a uniform gray.  He asked me to take a bite of it to confirm how weird it was.  I sunk my teeth in and didn't even go any further...the texture and flavor was so disgusting.  I'm disappointed by this place, especially since our food SMELLED so good (well, except for that eggroll...)
4	HGEEIFXZeLcxvztFOx4qw	After a late night out on Mischief Night, my friends & I finally headed out for "breakfast" around 2:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.  My friend, a local from Vegas, said she knew a place she wanted to take us to that would be perfect for our hunger.  Hungover & starved, I would have ate a doiley with some ketchup on it at this point, we walked into the Sunshine Cafe and I immediately felt at home.  The decor is warm & homely, if you like the warm colors of the 70s, which I do.  The waitress was super friendly and made us feel like one of her kids.  The food was cooked to order.  Fantastic.  Coffee was to die for.  The prices were just right.  My bottomless cup of joe was keeping me awake until the food was ready.  When it was placed in front of me, I dove in.  An omelette with veggies, cheese on top, with a side of whole wheat toast & homefries.  Yea, I ate it all.  It was that good & I was that hungry.  Whether you live in the Vegas area or are in town for a vacation, I highly recommend you take your hiney off the strip long enough to find Sunshine Cafe.  While it is not in the most desirable areas, the Sunshine Cafe brings some rays of goodness into your life, and your stomach.
2	Tub60O7VvqatWWa1vWDISQ	Good was good-had the duck poutine which was good but very salty. The service was lovely; very kind. The music is very loud- expect a lounge feel. It is pretty pricy for the food but overall a good experience
4	WKbTauSn6rETkDjlJyNbA	Stopped by for a late lunch after catching a film during the Wisconsin Film Festival.  The film was rather dark and depressing.  The stomach was empty and growling.  My sister took me here and noted she takes everyone here.  The dal was ok, the samosa was great despite the sweet sauce it came floating on top of.  This is my opinion though. I'd rather coat my potato-y goodness in mint and cilantro.  My dosa was pretty good and the spice was just enough, not too much.  My sister's chicken korma was good.  I was digging the gigantic chunks of potato on her plate.  I stole them while she wasn't looking.  I want to bathe in the coconut chutney served on the side.  Pictures of dishes posted for your viewing pleasure.  :)
2	x1fSehgUKj3B4kuZ9mamQ	I wouldn't really recommend this place in the Venetian Food Court. If I were you, and in the mood for  reasonably priced Chinese, I'd head to the Panda Express opposite.   Wasabi Jane's fried rice was hard, the salmon was over done, egg drop soup was cold, the broccoli was soft... Even when I asked for an extra plate, they gave me a miniature paper saucer!   I was not amused.
2	ZpbO6cBfrPWECq2U9Tdg	I checked the google reviews and decided to try this place after a movie at the Bank of Scotia theater.  It's just half block away.   Whoever says Le Vieux Dublin Club is super noisy, should have checked this place first.  Very noisy with very bad music with very bad speakers, that's make it worse than anything.  How much bad music?  Iri-shy kind music first, shakeshakeshake second, bagpipe third and Thriller the last after the 4 combination-, we left.   We tried Guinness - It was perfectly poured! yummy- lukewarm wings with soggy fries and no smiling grumpy server.  2 star for the location and Guinness...
2	AGkgCTB7BD7r3UA2Gv6Ww	okay i have re-visited this place last saturday and was extremely unhappy with the fact that after eating a perfectly made crunch roll (made with real crabmeat) my california roll was rancid. I have to wonder if the server just forgot about it, and left it sitting on the bar for pickup, as it arrived about 20 minutes after our first one. my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that, after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll, he returned holding the roll and said "that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat, so there is a slightly different taste" i explained that it wasn't the flavor, but the taste of rancid old fish. i have to say that in my 15+ years of eating sushi, i have never been re-served rancid rolls. don't they know that because this is the desert, fish has to be flown in to be fresh, and at 11pm at night, when a customer tells you the fish is bad...it  more than likely is. so for all of you servers out there,  when a customer tells you the fish is rancid,  just replace it! i'll give them another chance, but it won't be for california rolls (how funny i normally don't even order them, but wanted to taste the difference from that and my favorite Crunch roll) serves me right for experimenting! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1st review of Moira was this one.... finally! a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix. i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu (both regular and reverse) and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences, in the local zines. i was surprised that we could arrive at 10:45pm on saturday and the kitchen would still be open with people eating and enjoying a late night rendevous. we sat at the sushi bar, on the most uncomfortable chairs you could ever imagine. the chairs look cool and fashionable, but i still have bruises on my legs from getting in and out of my metal box of a chair. i will never sit at the sushi bar again, so long as they have them chairs (dang one should never say never!)   the food was very fresh, colorful and artistic. the presentation and combinations are phenominal. the miso soup was so authentic and filled to the brim with tofu and cost less than $4 for a cup of tofu filled, yummy, light and fresh miso soup, dang you just can't go wrong! (lucky you tofu lovers-i'm not a fan myself so this was actually a negative for me)  I had the cucumber salad and must say, i was thrown for a loop with this one.  i'm a cucumber salad (sunomono salad) loving fool if i gots to say so myself. Funny thing, i'm not a fan of raw onions so my first reaction to the cucumber salad was "YUKKIE" (just in my head) until i tasted it. the onions were so thin, that they tasted delicious in the salad. it added another bite to it, which was needed, because the dressing wasn't authentic in half vinegar to half sugar. they may be thinking of the diet craze, because there was much less sugar in it than there should have been, it was slightly vinegary.   i was pleased with every roll i had! only brought home 2 pieces out of 3 rolls just for me. my sister played it safe and just ordered one roll, squid salad and miso soup. I have to say her squid salad was deo, but only a few bites for me please.   this is definitely a place for all occasions and all sizes of parties, from 1-10 people so utilize happy hour responsibly. get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town!
2	GypXBgcUBVhPj5HD8TTA1Q	Super nice people, but the food just has not been that good so far.  For almost ten bucks, I wouldn't expect a chicken caesar to be made with red onions, cucumber and a Paul Newman's caesar dressing pack.  The pizza is good, but lots of places have good pizza in the same price range.  Other food has been both burned and undercooked at the same time.  They did a good job redecorating the place, and all the staff have been so nice.  I really hope they can make a go of it, but don't think I'll risk visiting again until I hear better things about them.
2	fOs0z4KTCAHSuKxJBOlajw	I haven't eaten at a Pizza Hut, or ordered from them in about 5 years! With theses new 2 for 1 places Pizza Hut is really not worth the price. I ordered delivery from this place, and it took 1 hour before it arrived. I was really unimpressed, the pizza was cold, so i had to put it in the oven to heat it up.  I got really sick after eating, total heart burn kept me up all night. I only ordered from here because I had a 10$ coupon. I will stick to my 2 for 1 pizza places from now on. Pizza hut isn't what it used to be.
4	PErR5WGQorHKaLmjKCOZA	This is the closest Popeye's I know of to me.  If I happen to be in the area I HAVE to stop in for the red beans and rice! If I knew how to make them like they do I would! I absolutely love them and as long as the biscuits are fresh and moist they go great with the beans and rice too.  The chicken is good as well but my favorite is the rice and beans!
4	TKImTSW0SxRptJQSfRXkRA	If you're looking for a quick bite, crave pizza, and don't want to wait 20 minutes for a whole pizza to cook, Fuel Pizza is a great "fast food" pizza place.  And despite being quick, it's way better than most pizzas I've tried.    Their slices are huge and the pricing is great.  I can get a slice of pizza, side salad (so I don't feel like a total pig), and drink for about $7.  If you're a meat lover, the Extreme Fuel Pizza is the best.  It's loaded with all kinds of meat.  You'll wonder where the dough is!    Don't get me wrong -- they have a variety of other food options, too, like pizzas for the whole family/group, chicken wings, bigger salads, calzones, etc., but I usually pick Fuel for lunch and get the pizza/salad combo.  As a side note, I also enjoy the theming of Fuel Pizza, particularly this one on South Blvd.  For some odd reason, I love the thought of eating my pizza in a gas station themed place.
4	PseBIlr64dcgGq746p3lg	Firehouse is great. The subs are warm and toasty, and the cool firemen hats are fun for kids. My niece loves coming to this location, which is also conveniently located near the dollar movie theater. I've had many a cheap date night eating either at Firehouse or Cicis and then heading over to the dollar movie theater, sometimes with my Firehouse sub shoved down in my big purse to sneak in the theater.   The sandwiches are reasonably priced, and they are always pretty quick with getting your order. I can't say I've had a bad experience there, ever.
4	mPSw09IpGQGsqjF6xmvSw	Another late night option if you're hungry at 1am. I find most of the food here pretty good. The quesadillas are really tasty, but sometimes the cheese isn't melted all the way through... The burgers are good, but tend to take awhile. Smoothies are really good as well, but they always run out of ingredients early in the day. I guess smoothies for breakfast is on everyone's list.
2	1EkEutbruZAgCbYEhUBq9g	You get the same burrito at every filibertos. The drive through man would only give me 2 sauces when I asked for 4. I was sitting at the open window and he just pretended like he couldn't speak English. Lies.
4	Yj4IA2BvaCrMOHe5k1lQ	We have been to Rusty Putter many times, and enjoy it immensely.   About 6 weeks ago, the service was very slow, as they were swamped with people.  They gave us complimentary Nachos, and were very apologetic, but anyone could see they were doing their best and trying hard  I would recommend to anyone
2	gSug4B9ZiWI8npr5COfb6A	As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang!  I love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it.  That saved my otherwise lackluster meal.  Also, the drive through was fast.  There, I said something nice.
2	Le5HqwNVMGTXmELMxHRhRA	So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.  They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.    On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.    On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place.
2	Smoo94ydPjrlR2DSxCx1xg	I think Soul has a lot of potential. It's in a nice location and has a nice atmosphere and is a great place to go for drinks.  My biggest issue with Soul was the service. I went for someone's birthday. She had called and made reservations for a large party,  which they had confirmed with her. But when we all gathered at Soul, the host told us that they do not accept phone reservations and made us wait for an hour and a half. He was kind of rude about everything.  As far as food goes, I really think Soul needs to spend some quality time perfecting a menu. I appreciate the more creative items on the menu. The grilled romaine was beautifully presented. But overall a lot of the things we tried were just mediocre. I really think this is because the menu is so ambitious, and could really benefit from fine tuning.
4	yPmg1mFrQuj2MzJWkjxjA	Outbacks are my standard fare when I travel.  If i'm alone, and my colleagues aren't there to guide me towards the best Chilean seafood place or Thai wonderment, I go for tried, true, and meaty.  Outback is just that.  It would be hard for me to give an outback less than 4 stars.  Others I know think that's insanely high for a consistently good steak place.  I don't agree.  I'd rate it lower if the service at that location sucked and I'd rate it higher if something insane happened.  Neither were the case tonight.  Outback at this location was great.  Service was great.  Food was great.  'Nuf said.
2	vATsk5XdH8MVbu65zmohw	I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while and finally went last night with my husband to meet another couple there for supper.  Given the other ratings here, I was surprised at how disappointed I was at the end of the evening.  Now, admittedly we were eating there pretty late (shortly before 9:00 PM) which may have accounted for some of the issues we had, but when we arrived there were several other tables occupied so it's not like we were the only ones keeping the staff from closing.  First problem-- our server.  She was very pleasant and friendly, but she was definitely trying to rush us through supper.  We had barely touched our salads when she was bringing out the entrees.  One of our party had to consistently ask for refills on her coffee, however, and the server had to be reminded more than once of items we'd requested.  I guess I can attribute that to the fact that she may not have been very experienced (she was quite young) and maybe also somewhat tired since we were eating late.  The other problem was the food.  The so-so service would have been easier to bear if the food had been great, or even just really good.  I was underwhelmed, however.  My Greek pasta was lackluster, with no seasoning that I could identify... Garlic, where were you??? This was Greek food, after all!  The feta cheese was tasty enough, but the pasta was swimming in olive oil and tasted old-- like it had been sitting around all evening, and had been microwaved right before it was brought to me.  I salted the hell out of it to give it some flavor, and some grated parm on the table would have been welcome, but there wasn't any.  I didn't bother asking for any, either, because the ancient-tasting pasta couldn't have been helped much no matter what.  My husband ordered a favorite of his, lasagna.  It looked good, but he said it wasn't anything special.  This man LOVES lasagna in all forms and is not really picky about it, so I know it must not have been much better than my pasta.  Our friends ordered a pepperoni calzone that looked fabulous (there was definitely a LOT more crust than filling there, however) and an order of wings.  The wings also looked okay but I didn't get a chance to ask how good they were.  We finished up with the chocolate cake, which *was* delicious.   The place is nicely decorated and in a very convenient location for us.  The owners were friendly and greeted us when we arrived, and there's a nice outdoor seating area.  The menu is extensive (but not ridiculously so) and there are lots of choices to suit almost every taste.  The prices are very reasonable, and the portions were decent.  I'd be willing to give it another try, but I'll probably have to twist my husband's arm if I want him to join me.  If I do get back there, I'll update my review.  For now, though, it really rates only two stars based on my experience last night.
4	cEEG9rRs38GTDaGd8p9w	The restaurant accommodated our entire soccer team (40 people) and the service was great. Everyone's order was correct and the food was good. Will definitely come back next year during the local soccer tourney.
2	WJNRQeljZjuV9xZoa6JP4w	My carnitas burrito was decent, and the chips and salsa were decent also.  However, service was somewhat lacking.  Food was slow to arrive, and came with no silverware.  We asked for silverware.  We waited.  No silverware came.  We went and got our own silverware.  By this time our lunch hour was running out.  We asked for the check and said we were in a rush.  The waiter brought the check and then disappeared again.  I had to go into the kitchen and hunt him down in order to pay.  The waiter ran away again while I was in the middle of paying.  Okay food.  Okay prices.  Don't go if you are on a schedule.  Possibly take your own silverware.
4	KOmDZpgyuVLWpQmydfvCgQ	As I get older, I appreciate certain things more.  One of these things is a good bar burger.  I stopped in on a whim during lunch.  Admittedly, I only have been here at night and usually at the end of the night so my memory was a bit hazy. The Main Depot is a simple bar doing simple things.  And that isn't a slam.  Often, places try to hard to be something their not.  Not here.  You can leave your pretenses at the door.   The beer selection is solid with your standard macro beer choices sprinkled with some great craft options (Can you say Karben4 Fantasy Factory?).  The bartenders are quick on the draw and down to earth.  During lunch, you get a sense there are a lot of regulars as they are know many on a first name basis. For lunch, I went with a bacon cheeseburger with a side of fries.  There is something magical about a burger cooked on a flat top grill.  A hard sear puts a nice crust on the outside while leaving the burger nice and juicy on the inside.  Cheddar, bacon, and fried onions make it complete. Wisconsin has a long tradition of great taverns and the Main Depot represents them well.
4	0MHH8oY3j4lSXdu10EFnUg	I actually like Pittsburgh Rare. I went with a couple of friends one evening for a good dinner before we left for our summer break/internships our junior year. The restaurant is really big and is located in the Sheraton.   When you first order, they bring over a plate of raw meat and describe each piece on it and tell you what you're looking at and how they cook it. It's actually really cool. I ended up getting a nice 20 oz porterhouse with a side of sauteed spinach. Another got the pork chops while the other 2 got the New York strip.  For appetizers, I got the French Onion Soup. Oh. This restaurant has a special way to cook the meat if you want to try something new. It's called Pittsburgh Rare where the meat is "flash seared and charred on the outside and blood red on the inside." It's actually not very hot in the middle. Since the restaurant is named Pittsburgh Rare, I figured, why not, give it a shot.   It was suprisingly not bad at all. The french onion soup was delicious. The way a french onion soup should  be tasted and the creamed spinach was very good. The total tab was about $100 / person because we also got desert and 2 bottles of wine.
2	ODj8oKCRRcRIM4BXFupDwQ	I've wanted to try this restaurant for some time and finally had an opportunity.  I stopped by on a Friday morning for some breakfast.   It is decorated nicely and the host was prompt in seating me. The food was average.  There were two things that could be improved. First, there was no background music, which made the sounds of the children crying in the restaurant seem even louder and second, the service was extremely slow.   I don't plan to go back any time soon.
4	NiMAlcBFlZjdCgJZMwVqGA	I ate here a couple of weeks ago. It was small but cute inside. Burgers were decent and the waitstaff was pleasant and efficient. I read yelp reviews before I try a place and was surprised at some of the negative comments. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back.
4	KWxrTloeM7nj5V22BqLV2A	One of my favorite steakhouses in Tempe area.   I travel here for business, therefore cost typically isn't an issue when choosing a place to eat. I appreciate Monti's for being reasonably priced and providing a tasty meal. Their prime rib is among the best I've ever had.  I've eaten here several times and have never seen any bugs. However, I do agree with the other reviews that the atmosphere is a little below expectations. The decor is old and the service isn't great. But the price and quality of the food makes up for it.
4	bWhz0gwcvVOafbc47BXAXA	I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round.
2	VIK1RnbubJQSEY0RHPCA	Was told that thiS buffet was suppose to rival that of wynn and bellagio so i had high hopes going in. It was "gourmet dinner" night which was $38.99 so my friend I decided to go back downstairs and gamble a little and come right before they did their lunch-dinner swap(lunch=19.99).  Upon entering you see the seafood selection and got giddy. it loooked Amazing: oysters, raw clams HUGE shrimp(wynn doesn't even serve shrimp at lunch anymore) crablegs etc.  Walked around and saw prime rib,   Leg of lamb and all tht good stuff. I figured heck, this is just the normal lunch, I should wait till they change it up for gourmet dinner. So from 3:45-4:30 I made a huge mistake, selfish I guess.. I only had me a plate of seafood thinking by the time I was done everything woul be swapped. So while I waited I realized that everyhing here only looks nice, and looks can be decieving. The oysters and clams were unfresh and had that very unpleasant seafood taste, the sashimi was sliced paper thin( unlike bellagio generous portions). Things started to go downhill from there. I got up to get a slice of prime rib and wth! They took it away and replaced it with 2 turkeys, the leg of lamb was gone and replaced by skirt steak. Reallly really overcooked and tough skirt steak. ( even though he said he was giving me the more rare piece).  I walked around the buffet to see what else had changed from normal lunch to " gourmet dinner" and was suprised to see that everything pretty much stayed the same. I n\u00e9ed to stop my rant now, i'm still at Aria but figured i should do my yelping duties and warn others of this overyhyped, overpriced buffet. I mean, $19.99 isn't bad but don't spend almost $40 for dinner. you're pretty much getting the same food you would have gotten at MGM at double the price :( if you want buffet  go to Wynn or Bellagio. Or you can get yourself a pretty decent dinner at a nice restaurant elsewhere.
2	LKV2bnesCr18V0pKEHSwg	Had lunch yesterday.  First, the new menu is CONFUSING!  Even our waitress agreed.  Ordered the brisket sliders, they tasted slightly burnt and had way too much sauce.  Side salad was ok.  Husband's 1/2 sandwich and salad was just ok.  Bathrooms were DIRTY!  I don't know when these are checked, but it looked like it had been DAYS.  Won't be back.  The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because we had a nice waitress.
2	lVEW0MnPhK2tZTbiTZyQ	I stopped here for breakfast Sunday morning. It was a nice sunny day, so very pleasant to sit out on their cafe seating. The food (pain dor\u00e9, eggs, sausage) was good, basic fare.   My problem was the service. The restaurant was by no means full but they were a bit slow to get around to serving me. Others I observed had a much more difficult time - one couple just got up and left in frustration. For me, when it was time to get the check, it was next to impossible. The kicker was when I asked two different waitresses for the check and they both said to me, "This is not my table."   M'enfin!  Here's a customer service note for the good folks at Boccacinos: I don't care if it's not your table. You should help me. Either get my check or get my waitress to bring it. Don't just brush me off.    Given that there are other nice places to sit out on this street, I would probably not come back here.
4	V2REDdebYKwg6B2g9l7Zw	Love this place, when you walk into the joint the smell of burgers slaps you in the face! I got the number #5 and it was very delicious. First time eating here and I have to say I will be back, burgers are a very good size. If it's your first time eating here make sure to ask what you don't want in your burger because I hate mustard and in my first bite I had realized it had some, still enjoyed it but removed all the mustard I could. Another thing was that they charge for barbecue sauce etc. That's the only thing I dislike about my visit, so 4 stars is my rate.
4	QPWEX0XhpEulHGYcSoIwvQ	I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food.
2	qRke8dASumtBqndBW4o5Q	The service was terrible - the food was not much better. We waited forever for our drink orders, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because our kids had to get milk from the bar. When we had to get the chip guy to refill our drinks, I knew it was no fluke.   We then pulled up the Yelp reviews and read all about what we were living at that moment. But as we hasn't gotten our food yet, we still had to wait.   I was full of chips and water, so I wasn't  able to finish main course. The only reason I took it home was because I was taught as a child not to waste food.   Won't be back-ever. Wasn't all  bad, but with so many good restaurants within a couple of miles, eating here would be a waste of time and money.
2	T2fOMaax61md3zUO39oEyw	Oh well, McDonald reste McDonald. Une frite ou un McFlurry de temps en temps lors d'une soir\u00e9e arros\u00e9e ou un caf\u00e9 s'il est gratuit (reste qu'il est meilleur que celui du Tim!), mais le reste du menu je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9viter. Le service de cette succursale est particuli\u00e8rement lent pour aucune raison apparente, mais c'est le plus proche de chez moi alors c'est le plus pratique lors des urgences frites \u00e0 2AM..
2	kRUBd1sVBYXASylBGJP1Mg	I wish I could have given more stars, but I'm going to have to agree with Alissa.  Service was pretty bad, but my rainbow trout was very good and nicely cooked.  I think this happens in every Cracker Barrel, but it feels like you get herded in and out... and then made to look at all this stuff that tends to collect dust once the novelty of it wears off.  It may just have been a Saturday evening, but the cashiers were in no rush to move the line to pay... we pretty much just waited there for a single cashier (even though there were 2 available) to ring everyone up.  Ploy to impulse buy at the register?  Maybe so.....but it did not work on me... just got me super annoyed with lack of service.
4	n87aPenY9PVf0DdlJLeNw	I've ate In and I've taken out and had delivery...every experience was the same.  Friendly service and order was up in a timely manner...even delivery was awesome...and still hot! I'd definitely recommend the pizza the most from this place. Takes me back to my days growinv up and the food court at Century III mall
2	JhHgwXGbEH2oD4eaVsPsyw	Yet another Asian-inspired food chain! Oh c'mon do we need this in Champaign? We have so many Chinese/Korean restaurants in campustown and honestly, they are way better than Flat Top.   So, the whole stir-fry concept that they have is actually Mongolian BBQ. The difference is that they have tonnes of raw vegetables and ingredients to choose from. Oh, not to mention, weird sauces and food combinations. My combo was okay (it was brown rice, clams, beef, vege, salmon and roti prata) but if you don't have a sense of what goes with what, then your dinner is going to be a disaster.   It's clever of them to have this pick-your-own-ingredients kinda concept because if the food was bad and you complained, they can point their fingers back at you and say that you chose the ingredients. Then again, you are not the only culprit. The grill sensei is responsible as well. If he over-grilled your food, it will taste just as bad no matter how wonderful your selections are. My friend's moo shu was not wrapped very well and some of the rolls fell apart. Well, there goes your dinner.   I think it is good to try it once but more that once? You decide. Still, the combo of rice, salmon and roti prata bothers me. Maybe I am just a stuck-up purist who thinks that chickpea dhal is the only way to go. Could this be a one-hit wonder like Bar Louie? We'll have to see.
2	P00gxHMmZkTEykI9eUh8Yg	Originally posted 4/11/2009. Edit - 1/17/2012: I originally gave this place four stars. I'm not sure why.  This place is closer to a 2.5 star, but since we don't get half-star rating on Yelp, two it is). It's not terrible, but it's definitely not exceptional. Service has never been particularly warm and friendly. Bottom line: it'll do if you're in a rush and just want a slice.
4	aTBfcI9mc4fVPrmSJFyFhw	This is my favorite place to go for more authentic Mexican food.  Azteca has a huge menu and they serve you huge portions.  This place is large so you rarely have to wait to be seated, even on the weekends.  Everything I've eaten here is fantastic, and I have never been able to eat all the food that I'm served.  The best part is that they serve you free sopapillas (tortilla chips with whipped cream, cinammon, and strawberry sauce) with your check.
4	o7JQCFgkXmOSYGUPqvLZA	Jennie is all about customer service, treats everyone with great respect, she loves her job and it shows. Great service, great fish and the coldslaw was excelent! Alex is also a favorite person here, always greets us with a big smile. "your ladies"
4	8EVxKwbiu9HPYYpWC2NkrA	Not a big fan of Dominos, but decided to try them again since the special was going to save me some money. My simple pizza, with only diced tomatoes and sausage was okay except that it tasted heavily salted. The pasta dish was not for me, with its "bowl" made of what could be thick crust of pizza dough. No way am I adding this to my diet. The enclosed macaroni with tomato sauce and chicken was good, but not worth the cost. Delivery was fast, employee polite and hunger satisfied.
4	ANIMr8xAkC4UiXS27sGtw	some of the best dining experiences happen when you almost don't go inside the restaurant. this is the kind of eatery that makes you thankful for crappy strip malls.  sure, the exterior isn't great. and the neighborhood isn't perfect. but this place is small, friendly, clean. the food is excellent  my friend and i tried las glorias because we were in the area and we had a coupon. we were incredibly happy with ourselves after we found this place.  the chips were crisp and fresh. the bean and salsa dips were delectable. the rice was great. the portions were large. my friend said this place reminds her of her very favorite spot from home. she is something of a chile relleno connoisseur, and she said this one was among the best she had ever had. this batter and lots of cheese.  we will definitely be going back., coupon or not.
2	WAV6V58Gy2B1AAdq36RBwQ	The new owners are wrecking this place. Just returned to Montreal for a short vacation and the staff are way overworked. Won't be going back - it's better in my memories. The food has gone down hill.
2	KYccLguklj1dNPiMLEuBg	Just go to Costa Vida and save yourself some time. Their sauces are too salty and their steak is not as good as Costa Vida. I don't care which one came first, Costa Vida dumps on Cafe Rio, hands down.
4	E0RhpiKjf5Ap0WocF5ZG0A	I've been eating at Venezia's on and off for a couple years now.  At first, the thought that kept going through my mind was "Man, this doesn't even come close to Jimmy and Joe's".  Fast forward to today.  J&J's keeps raising their prices while the quality has gone waaaaay downhill, while Venezia's keeps tasting better and better to me.  I like it more than Barro's these days.  The great things about this place are that the prices are very reasonable (in fact, we've noticed they've actually LOWERED some prices in the last year!), you can get slices from open to close, and the staff down there is really cool.  They know my wife by name now!  It's great to know that we've got a more convenient place to go for pizza when we don't feel like waiting for and making the drive to Oregano's.
2	MpUEgtV6GNe6KMPeVruCkQ	Rude service!! Went thru drive thru and was never said hi too. Just a hand do we can pay.. As we were paying we did give 5.00 in coins and we told her it was and she drops of portion on the ground. Tried to pick it up and it landed in someones spit etc. she never said sorry for dropping it just opened window for an expectant .75 she dropped.. She then proceeded to toss our bags of burritos at us and we had to wait for our soda cause She forgot!!
4	abqdOgXz0W9z7tPqOqbQw	After the VYE at Desert Mission Food Bank, many of the Yelpers stuck around to grab brunch someplace in Sunnyslope. While there were a lot of options to chose from, I'm proud my fellow Yelpers decided to try a place that had yet to be reviewed: The Eye Opener Family Restaurant (formerly Tom & Tiny's).   This Phoenix family-owned diner is open 7 days a week from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. for breakfast and lunch and is a morning ritual for many of Sunnyslope's longtime residents. One of my favorite things about Sunnyslope is the small town feel with access to all the urban amenities of Phoenix. Places like the Eye Opener feed that sense of place. Hal (the owner) is a kind man who loves what he does, is liable to come by your table himself to fill your coffee cup and make sure everything is OK . It is evident that he views his customers as extended family.   Here are some of the things I like to eat at the Eye Opener:  Standard eggs, toast and hash brown breakfast   the Chef omelet - egg whites only (filled with yummy things like ham and green chili and topped with cheese)  Gyro (the tzasiki sauce is delicious and is flavored with dill!)  It's not on the menu, but Hal makes his own hummus and it's just delicious!!
2	C3HpXtka7Z40NSAeoSlCA	So I decided to give this place another shot Super Bowl sunday.  Had a couple of beers and the chips/queso.  Well, it was some white cheese with tons of garlic.  No tomato's or anything else.   They apparently do have live music now on Fri and Sat but of course their website is never updated to show who the entertainment is.  Okay place for a beer/sports close to home, but I'd say just eat before you go.
2	XO9eZD4mxQW13yxmmNYtUw	Overcooked dry filet mignon, very cold ambiance. Waiters seemed very confused and messed up on many orders in a reservation for 40 people.. The oysters were way to salty.. I won't be in a rush to return any time soon!
2	qf3rb6m2SU3pw6nf6qFByg	"Overpriced" is the most accurate description of this place. If you have a taste for good, authentic Chinese food, your best bet is to skip Pearl.  The Kung Pao had no "pow," the Mongolian Beef was bland, and the $9 hot and sour soup was good, but that's not good enough for a small bowl of soup that cost $9.  The only points I can give this place is for its ambiance and large wine list. But for the food, keep walking. Better yet, take a cab to a real restaurant off the strip.
2	sl8bxDHP3xaH57MFfHA	Visited the Strip House during a visit to LV last week (4/7/11). Came later in the evening (930ish) and restaurant was pretty empty. My friend and I felt a little under dressed, but did notice other seated parties dressed similarly. The restaurant itself is quite cozy...dark and sexy B/W photos on the walls, with some larger ones back lit with red light. The food was decent, but a medium-well fillet should have some pink and not be charred quite that much. All sides are Ala carte and as stated in other reviews, quite potatoe-centric. The service was the sticking point with me though. Sullen waiter who just repeated out the specials and then zoomed off, appetizers delivered (or tossed) on the table and no real customer service given. For the price of the bill ($200+), I would expect a little more respect for the patrons.
4	INimLquO7Y0ehmgxJCGc5Q	Foods always good :) who doesn't live some  Taco Bell at 130 am lol.. Just make sure to check the bag. They forget small things sometimes. Over all good team over there. Highly recommend the cinnamon deserts
4	ASv1750Nj5s0fL8hucnAw	hey!  gallaghers food is good. the prices are fair. they have a nice menu with a variety of stuff. i don't know about the other gallaghers, but this one has offtrack betting.  it's a fun atmosphere and they put in numerous plasmas to spiffy the place up. the only draw-back to gallaghers, is the slow service. i don't know why it's slow. i've been here numerous times. the food is always good and no matter how busy or dead it is, they are just always slow. if you have time, it's a good place to go. if you're in a rush, go somewhere else.
4	v3AyE7RFabip0OhaJX4jbg	4.5 stars  FINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.  This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.  They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.    The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.    Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.  Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.  I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.  The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.    And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....  And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.  (photos submitted)
2	95YBukYOGCX05H255ZsbUQ	The atmosphere is awesome-eating next to the aquarium.  Our salad was good, and the clam chowder was average.  We split the special, prime rib.  Had to send it back twice because it was way over cooked.  The third one was too.  They said there was no more, but one server said there was a whole other roast-and they were trying to find a med. piece.  We took the third piece just because it was getting frustrating.  Despite sharing, having two drinks, and no dessert we paid $80 (with tip) for an overcooked piece of meat.  No discount was offered, free dessert, or anything like you might expect.  Not even a visit from the manager to apologize.  We won't be returning, which is sad because we think the atmosphere is one of the best in the west valley.
2	EfBpke9BOIYnfnZvc8gkw	Yeah, I wasn't very impressed with this all you can eat sushi joint. I found it strange that 1 order of a maki roll was for only 2 pieces. What the what? I spotted a tray with pre-plated sashimi on it covered with saran wrap. So yes, it's quick and edible but even at $14.49 for lunch I still didn't think it was the worth the money and have eaten much better all you can eat sushi in my time. Also found it strange how limited the all you can eat menu was, but I suppose that makes sense if everything is pre-made... sure, it's busy so what you get is fairly fresh but personally I'd rather wait and get something that has been made to order. Also found that the nigiri and maki rolls fell apart very easily.   As a final warning, I'd suggest you stay away from the edamame, it looked pretty wilted, wasn't salted and was just plain bad. I couldn't finish it.    So if you couldn't tell by this review, I will not be returning to Kanda any time soon.
2	SVtTEAVa9OrwW0slSORtg	I've had Rosati's from several locations in Phoenix. At my house I have two stores within range and when I am at my friends we order Rosati's near them. Ordered a Pan style. The ingredients are very good (as they are at every Rosati's I've ordered from) and it actually arrived without the top of the pizza sliding all to one side... Kudos the the delivery guy.  However, I counted six (6) tomato tops in the sauce on the pieces I grabbed. In my opinion it completely ruined my experience. The tops I am referring to are where the stem connects to the tomato. That little piece of stem ruined it for me. One maybe....six????
4	AYO4IUc4rlHUBfn8X7zI1w	My aunt and uncle love this place because the beers are huge and their dog's invited. What more could you want? One time they were there and two folks had ridden their horses right into the bar. This is their kind of place!  We sat outside on a perfect afternoon and heard stories of other Buffalo Chip visits. Nothing too crazy and never any bullriding witnessed. They said they'd never seen a fight either but this is the kind of place that just screams Roadhouse fight.   Their dog made a best friend there once but he's long gone. I could make best friends here with a tall beer and a pail of peanuts.
4	vmWNeJGOnjqMXBDITLsA	According to this reviewer, this is the best Mexican food in Matthews.  Each meal comes with a complimentary basket of chips and salsa, and the portions are very generous and generally delicious.  I highly recommend the Arroz con Pollo.    Service is prompt and polite, and the interior is clean and charming in a constructed-before-we-were-concerned-about-stereotypes sort of way.  If you are in Matthews, this is a much better bet than Monterrey or that sketchy place downtown.
2	GmoLPaK522aIIjyvULCNnA	This is a review of the Champions course at TPC.  Overall, this course is a big disappointment.  The conditions were poor with the greens bombarded with ball marks, tee boxes filled with divots.  The course looks like a run down, old course.  Maintenance must be on vacation here...How dare the PGA put their name on this course with such bad conditions.   The layout feels like a muni someplace in Texas.  The holes, most especially the par 3s, are plain vanilla.  Finally, if you come to Scottsdale thinking this is a desert course you will be disappointed.  There isn't a cactus to be found here, and the desert is hard pan waste areas.  No desert.  The cart girl disappeared for 2 hours in the heat of the day.  When we asked where she went the reply was "I went to lunch".  Hun, have lunch on the damn cart! There are many many better choices for golf nearby.  I would not return here again.
4	z9219C2Tw2E752v7dlsTtg	Best (Italian Style) Pizza in Charlotte.  For a thin crusted Italian style pizza, this by far the best place, tucked away in a little shopping center off of Montford.  It's family friendly, and the quality is consistently good.   The Luisa (no meat) is my family's favorite, follow by the Milano when I am in the mode for  a bit of meat.  The spinach and meat lasagna  is great as well.
4	H3OCCdhGxsFqQm0PiPJNag	Visited with a group of people from work for lunch, and it was fantastic. I had the Shrimp Verde, and it was quite tasty. Several people had the hot, lava bowl and absolutely loved it. I have no idea what the proper name is, but seriously, could it be cooler than "I would like to eat the hot lava bowl?" No, it could not.  I was a little surprised at the prices, which were more than I usually pay for lunch, but it is because of the fresh, great seafood. It came out to about $20 for each of us for lunch, but well worth it.
4	pVNoR5MhsZuwLXGySovjw	No, this is not where you go to find a lawyer if you get in a fender bender. It's where you venture to for a delicious lunch.  I've been a BBM fan since I moved to Charlotte ten years ago. I usually visit the other location, but this one is right around the corner from me. Well, for another day at least. Moving day tomorrow!  Anyways, the only problem I have with this place is I can never decide what I want. I pretty much like it all. Turkey Reuben, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, Firecracker Wrap. If you dine in, you get free soup with your meal. Heads up: if Minestrone is one of the options... get it. Delicious.  BBM is great for catering office lunches, meetings and what not. Need a quick lunch option? Call you order in for pick. You can be in and out quickly.
2	06WlawD3Vd7uvQm88KQ	So I live near Deans Place, hence the reason I would try this establishment after living here for 10 years.  Desperation and/or out of options near home.  I went for ribs night...the ribs are not good/overcooked and service was aweful.  I would have accepted 1 without the other based on venue and pricing.  The other 2 items ordered were fine, good for bar food.  Summary...I won't be back and would only recommend visiting if intoxicated AND walking home .  I really wanted to find a hidden  gem, but instead I found exactly what I had feared for many years.

4	Ml6bF42XVCBi1ubatGfyw	This was a tossup between 3 or 4 stars, but since I go here every time I'm back home in Arizona, they won the toss. This isn't what it was in its glory days, but the barbequed pig still totally rocks, and who can resist the deep dish apple pie? It's a fun place to eat and I've never had bad service here. So much of Phoenix is impermanent that it is a pleasure to see a worthwhile restaurant beat the odds.
2	qjFfTEaci0FbIPzdzuUcGw	Not impressed.  First I was sat at a table that was back to back with another person....we are talking 3 inchs apart. I dont like sitting that close to another group.....this place is tiny.  Bread was plain old italian bread...not warm Served with some olive oil...no pepper or spice....boring,  Salad arrived....dressing was good....salad was ok....until I got the bill....$7....what a joke. I thought this place was a $$ not a $$$.  Entree arrived. I got the cannelloni, pretty tasty meat filling and alfredo sauce. I like alfredo over marinara so I had them substitute it.....but I wasnt told that I would be charged $2.....another joke....been to may places and never charged to sub a sauce. My girl got the beef stew over rigatoni.....she liked it.   Dessert. Pistachio gelato with a piece of biscoti Tasty....another $7  Toward the end of the meal the service slowed down to a stop and I stopped getting drink refills...no big deal as they were closing.  So a recap.... $4 for drinks $14 for some tiny salads $34 + $2 for entrees with a different sauce.......dot dot dot $7 for 4oz of gelato add some tax and a $12 tip...you get.... $78....wont happen again.
4	Qc0HtCvFrWregY6qgr3x7g	i've been to tons of mexican restaurants in az.  this is good, authentic food. the portions are large. the sauces are different and tasty. they have good lunch specials ranging anywhere from $5.50-$7.00. the place is very small. you could be waiting a while if it's busy. it's cramped. if you're looking more for a fancy place or large place, this isn't it. because it's so small, and when i went today it was packed, the service was very slow. but if you're looking for really good food, pedro's has it.
4	PmWYwnFJKAM9JQx2vAUgeg	Leaving the club...looking for late night eats...and In-N-Out's closed!  This Chicago kid was ready to commit ritualistic suicide on the spot.  Well, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we came here, and I finally got to try carne asada fries.  This leads me to believe that Tacos Mexico used to be known as Tacos France (seriously though...what a stupid name).  Whatever...even though they weren't on the menu, they sure did serve the fries.  And while my Californian friends remarked that it's made a lot better near them, I had no complaints.  They were cheap, plentiful, and damn tasty.
4	da0t2i7JTBpJMlRawnoEQ	Quick and fast... great for lunch!  This place is located off of Harris, but a little hard to spot if you aren't looking for it.  The parking lot can be a bit of a krap shoot since it is located on the end and everyone seems to try to take the spots closest to the door.  Has great lunch specials and it is super fast (so you can enjoy your lunch without having to watch the clock too much).  Chips and salsa were kept on the table - The salsa has a medium kick to it (just right) and I can pretty much down a whole basket of chips myself (SAD, but true).  From Harris, the place doesn't look that big, but it really opens up inside and they have some pretty wicked decor inside.... some of the booths have a false thatched covering over them and the decor always seems festive.
2	AQn6uf6W6SjcvrLsgo1FuQ	I'm a vegetarian, and the vegetarian hibachi/sushi combo just fails to impress.  Largish portions, at least.  For hibachi, I don't know where else to go.  For sushi, both Chaya and Umi come immediately to mind.  For a large group, it's hard to beat Yokoso, though, as they have tables that will seat groups of 12-24.
4	HwkeZuMsGIFfwzwwD2g	I would go here more often if I was given more then $5 for dinner I am sick of crap Donald's for dinner.  The only thing I think they need to do to improve is provide wifi and maybe lower the price on there drinks and food.
4	xl8lPqnu2NhxlgXYzP7O4g	I have been looking for a great breakfast spot in my area and I have found it!  Parson's is a great little family owned place where the owner still works with the staff on a daily basis.  The location itself is worn out, but the food definately delivers!  Let me just say this now....  Best Pancakes in town!  No question.  The staff is super nice and the food flys out of the kitchen.  It's a great Breakfast spot, not to be overlooked!  And don't pay attention to Jennifer D's review.....she is from Snottsdale where they really have no idea of what a good traditional breakfast should be.
2	q2wM162Bmc54asa0zKo5w	Just to give you a summary of today lunch.   We got the Atami room  Group of 8 people. We arrived early 11:50am, all were sitting and ready to order by 12:00. Waitress shows ups (after we asked a couple of times) at 12:25pm. Takes our order.  Soup arrives with Salad at 12:45. (After we asked again)  Lunch arrives at 1:15pm. We had to rush to eat it  to get back to the office........  Can we say SLOWWWWW Service.....they need to hire more staff....  It's a pity, because the food is good and the ambiance is nice.....but seriously slow.
4	V1zxTpQsaLplnSUOeW9drw	I haven't been to the Med Grill yet, so I can't compare, but I'm really happy with the food at Aladdin's.  The portions are good and the prices are reasonable even for a poor grad student like myself (though I will "splurge" on one of the juices and appetizers if someone's treating me to the meal).    The falafel here is excellent--crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside.  I also enjoy the pickled veggies they add to the rolled pitas.  My brother, who absolutely hates getting his hands dirty/sticky while eating, thought they did a good job rolling the pitas here--no spills.  I like that they serve the dolmas and the foole m damas warm here.  My one quibble is that the pita bread that comes in a basket with the appetizers.  isn't served warm as well.  I've never had the tempting-looking desserts here because all the other food is so filling and delicious.
4	UZ1BbY6z4dbakukZhDXpLQ	I have not been to this place in like 10 years.  Got invited to go to lunch today and it was EXACTLY the same as it was the last time I was there.  Buffet was pretty good and the menu has not changed either.  Not much to look at but for a 6.00 lunch what do you expect.
2	wyfqutBB1d6dl6Y8D2H2Zg	After waiting for over a month for this place to open, constantly annoyed by the sign on the door stating, "Training in Progress" I was expecting something spectacular.  The name itself "Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their "special cheese blend" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didn't forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, I'd like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese.  The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened. We also liked the decor & the windowed kitchen.  For the price you pay for a very, simple burrito, that offers nothing revolutionary about it, their menu is over priced.  I would rather go to Baja Fresh or any other neighborhood Mexican restaurant.
2	ksp2YLdE5xBnfZ6ajxbg	I was completely unimpressed with Grapes. I had a penne dish with marinara sauce, sausages and chicken. The sauce was so bland that you can open a jar from Safeway and find more flavor.   I also had veal piccata which I thought was very disappointing. It seemed like both dishes were missing a couple ingredients that would have given them more taste.   I truly believe that if I had a cook off with the chef I could find recipes for the same entrees and could cook two better dishes.   The service was good and I do like the atmosphere there, so hopefully they will find a new chef and the restaurant will improve.
2	Q4MqdCW5dljzpbeALBG95A	This evening was the last straw. I thought the last time I had rolled tacos, they sucked because it was the special of the day. Today, they sucked just as bad. This Filiberto's seems to have gone downhill. The meat inside was practically nonexistent and what was there was tough and dry. Not sure what Fili's adds to their guacamole but it's runny and tastes like plain avocado. On a positive note, the green sauce is tasty, but they don't give you enough of it.
4	uVHvAMudHUeT9W9uNgQ	I must admit, I don't think Ethiopian food is my end all, be all. I've had it twice since moving to Phoenix. It's not that I shy away from eating with my hands. It's not that I don't appreciate the culture, or how unique of a dining experience this is... authentic as you're going to get in the Valley, I can imagine.   It's not any of those things... I think it's the food. Now, c'mon, I'm not going to lie. The food is tasty. It's just not what gets me going. I went to Lalibela with a couple co-workers. I was looking to get out of the office and enjoy some chit chat. Mission accomplished. Yet, can 3 people seriously get full from sharing a plate of Lalibela's finest? I think not. Besides, I get kinda skeeved out when dirt or food gets caught under my nails. Yikes. (Watching my co-workers pick at their fingers after the meal was not the most pleasing way to polish off my lunch.)  Sounds like I'm complaining, right? Well, I'm not trying to. I mean, this place is good. Don't get me wrong! I s'pose if you enjoy Ethiopian food and eating with your hands (and strange textures and really thin bread), then this is the place for you.   I give it 4 stars for what it is: a really good Ethiopian restaurant... With, if you didn't know, really good chai tea. Oh, and the food... Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. Maybe it's your end all, be all.
4	ot0bDpJFuqyoBWN9hDeeA	Just had lunch here for the first time because my friend always raves about it.  I have been craving a real deli and this ace really hit the spot!  I had a ridiculously meaty sandwich filled with pastrami, bologna, and salami...drool.  Melted to perfection on rye with swiss on top with a nice pasta salad on the side.  The pickles...save the best for last.  I plan making this place a weekly affair starting next Sunday.  Also, such a cute patio, we sat outside and the weather was beautiful!  If you are looking for real a deli, this is the place.
4	5D2JefoJcDgDqnrJ4orDw	Asian fusion food.  Very busy, usually a wait for dinner.  The food is above average, but the decor is very cramped.  With the usual crowd, this is not a place for a sedate dinner, but its central location makes it a nice place to eat before doing something else in the area.
2	MNmYLWQMTaSaU68yNLg1hQ	Not bad. clean, not busy. Food was as good as McDonald's gets. The only bad thing is that the employees were yelling and fighting in the back. Kinda funny but really unprofessional considering the age of them and that the manager was standing there laughing at them.
4	FXlkroysYovvocnRuoYC0A	This is an excellent little Italian grocery, giving my old favorite in Chicago a run for its money.  Delicious fresh made pastas, a generous selection of wines, and of course all of your favorite Italian store go-tos like the Limonata, the Italian cookies, the fresh meats and cheeses.  Plus the whole aesthetic of the place is just plain charming.  I'm putting this in my grocery rotation, at least monthly.
4	kArMj14rhOJX4FDrdsUkyw	Gyeeeeeah Im a fan....  This place is better than eating fast foods.. I normally order their Broccoli cheddar soup for my mom. It's quick and easy in and out of cheap sandwiches and cheap eats..If i had to order something here I would normally order the cold cut combo on wheat bread toasted with cheese.. All I have to say is it get' the stomach full.. Nothing too fancy like firehouse subs but get's the job done to satisfy your hunger and it's somewhat healthy. Like I said its better than eating Mc Donald's or any other fast food places.. and their lettuce and veggies and meats are pretty fresh as well can't really complain..
2	3nUIZn6f3oeP2rFWgiMujQ	The quality of the food at the buffet is really poor.  The only food that is good is the salad bar and the gelato.  The teriyaki or shoyu chicken is always over cooked and very dry and the roast beef is always tough.  I would recommend going to the Santa Fe Station buffet. The food there is ten times better and it's for the same price.
2	WWWb8dxS1p96pyW0Nfx6yw	For all of the hype that this place gets, I was extremely disappointed in the food, the service, and the price. The food was probably the least disappointing of the three, as it felt a bit more authentic than your typical Mexican food chain. I will admit that I didn't try any of their well-known hatch chilies. For the price, this food didn't make par.  The service was awful. We were visited at most twice by our waiter, once for our order and once for the check.
2	h9MXLdofbIDdznHyTufu2g	Decided to go here because the line for the Buffet at the Bellagio was super long. The prices are ok but the food was just meh. The portions of the pasta were decent. But over all i've been to better
2	7duruNWFoLfqs7luGAvfQ	Yet another bad meal. This place is so close to home that I continue to try it thinking some food fairies will magically create some amazing food for my next visit but it never happens.   - meat is fatty and some parts chewy - lack of vegetable dishes - inconsistent cooking - staff is not really attentive/friendly  The plus to this place is it's clean and has free wifi. If you are craving Chinese and don't feel like driving far, this may fill that need but only in a pinch. I'm truly surprised they're still open for business.
2	OLCVlPhsDUp8f00eWqrg	I was pretty stoked to go to the Half Shell when I first saw the sign go up in front of the flat patch of earth where it now stands.  Being a seafood place only minutes away from my house, I was happy to know that I had another good dining option close by.  My wife and I went the week that Half Shell opened and we haven't been back.  The main reason was the food.  I enjoy good seafood, and freshness is certainly a key element to good quality.  The seafood here was the antithesis of fresh, and that was right after the place opened!  To compensate, the cooks saturated the food with salt.  The entire meal was absolutely terrible.  We also gave the bar/lounge area a shot and our disappointment only continued.  My wife asked for a key lime martini and the three bartenders did not know how to make it.  She eventually told them all of the ingredients, and not surprisingly it came out terrible.  Sure, I'll bet these guys are experts at serving Bud Lights all night long, but outside of that they weren't very good and had poor attitudes to boot.  I gave the place an extra star for the great view of the city.  Other than that, I don't have anything positive to say about the Half Shell.  Perhaps one of these days if we're bored and out of options we'll give it a second chance and see if anything has improved.
4	iZ7Z6KMKDLOOvwVGTixlnQ	Steak burrito especial was delicious. Perhaps it was the location (lake mead) or the fact that it was free. But kudos to Rubios for using this promotional opportunity to dish out some good stuff. Fast food Tex Mex done right.
2	9d1ZlVdzCPNRPezadrRRuw	So we traveled quite the distance to get to this place based on the recommendation of our concierge.  Lesson learned, never listen to his advice again.  Yes they have a very extensive breakfast menu, but its actually quite disturbing how quick the food comes out.  Within 5 mins, literally, we got our food.  Essentially it makes me think of a fancy diner with large vats of food in the back just waiting to be plated.  We had the asperge moi which was an omelette with swiss cheese and asparagus and an eggs benedict.  We also had the 2 eggs breakfast with poached eggs, bacon, beans, potatoes, fruit and toast.  Really nothing special and knowing that the food has been sitting back there for awhile and not freshly made is disturbing.
4	KIPgvyVh4y9SaCZ6O8fA	One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. They make fresh pasta, and the free bean dish with the bread they start you off with is so yummy and garlicy! It is a small cozy restaurant! I frequented this place at least once a month! They have delicious salads! They do a really good job at putting a lot of love into the food!!!
2	F6ddCjuiBDlGOmfcZto8g	My first visit to the half shell. I ordered the crab and shrimp nachos, a half order must of weighed two pounds. I couldn't finish it, bigger is not always better, but I should have known better. By the time I found any crab or shrimp it was cold. I would give another item of the menu a try another day though.
4	w6gq8VgGJIPh641ZmzlhFg	One of my co-workers took us here for lunch on a cold and nasty day for lunch. All I can say is that the owner really took care of us. The food was great.  We got some Cream Cheese ragoons which were out of this world.  I don't know if was my mood, the weather or the food but this place really hit the spot.  Was it great to look at??? NO!  But what really good Chinese places are?
4	qbLVBnLqewDbgpN9zsWg	I've eaten here more times than I can count.  The atmosphere can be romantical and it's also great for groups.   I absolutely adore are the cannelloni (kind of like manicotti) which you can get with half red sauce and half white sauce.  Also the spicy cheese bread must be had.  I am a huge fan of the vegetable salad with the yogurt basil dressing, although most of my dining companions swear by the porta salad and the Garibaldi sandwich.  As for the pizza I have had some good and bad experiences depending on what was ordered, and I usually avoid it, because I already have my favorites.  A note to the foodies, this is not authentic Italian cuisine, the entrees are mostly reminiscent of an era 30-40 years ago.  They're still fabulous. For dessert try the chocolate chip cannolis, yeah not very Italian but they are still very scrumptious.
4	4rmMiVcoiNX4QvTjtdGHA	I have been to several Indian buffets in Phoenix and also in San Francisco and Boston and I was definitely pleased with my experience here. I got the Groupon for two buffets for $10 and came in on a Saturday night to find an almost empty restaurant. Nevertheless, the food was hot and fresh and there was a nice variety of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, and most of the dishes were very tasty.   The atmosphere is kind of weird particularly some of the employees who watch over you awkwardly and peer out the door hoping the place is going to fill up miraculously. Otherwise would definitely recommend.   P.S. The Naan was delicious. My girlfriend couldn't get enough,
4	KCGXBbi0Iiq0KMy1uYgw	Wah Kee is one of several places I wish I had spent more time at in Madison. The menu is very extensive, and it has both many Chinese dishes that are familiar in American-Chinese restaurants, as well as several specialty noodle dishes. Not all of the descriptions are adequate; I ordered one Singapore Noodle dish that had eggs in it, the fact of which was not mentioned in the menu description (it was otherwise a very good item, though). So you may want to ask the staff about the items if you have questions (they are very helpful). Overall, I highly recommend this place.
2	oqaGreolBuOI0raFzKkA	Well... I dunno where to start. Have you ever felt like you got screwed at a restaurant? Probably... Well we felt like we got screwed here. I read about the seafood platter and so I decided we'd just "start with that". Well that's pretty much where the good experience ended. The waitress - knowing full well we were tourists - didn't hesitate to omit everything unless we asked, she didn't say a word. Didn't tell us it was $70 for the "small". Which by the way should never be ordered by only two people....15 oysters, 8 scallops, 3 sets of crab legs or 4, 10-12 shrimp... Like this was a doozy and she laughed it off like we knew how much seafood we would be getting... How the fack would we?! This is for a group of at least 6 especially if you don't wanna suck down on "in house shocked oysters and scallops". Mmmmm raw fish.... We left there $100 poorer and disgusted by the amount of seafood we "tried" to consume. About 9 oysters were left. The Montrealers on our right saw what we had and seemingly cause they could speak french they were able to order the platter omitting the scallops and oysters for half the price... She tried rationalizing they're ability to do that with some blabbering that made no sense. Lesson learned... Don't ever order a seafood platter that's not on the menu and be skeptical of a waiter that only points to things instead of describing them. By the way this place will break the bank...the last reviewer is delirious...
2	sGAg70INGGV1oNMeLCG4gw	It's a buffet in a casino, meaning it's difficult to get into, enjoy your meal and get out of.  The line starts to form 2 hours before they even open for business, meaning you're gonna be waiting way longer than you should as the food is not really much better than anywhere else, nor are the prices.  The noice from the casino makes the visit less than pleasurable and to be honest, I only went because of the family I work for.  I won't be going back anytime soon as I'm not a gambler either.
2	NW7nPjWNgIKYDIS9YOJ8g	Alrighty Sonic..... I have given you a few chances, because all of the other Sonics I go to I am pretty happy with. When its lunch time and I want something quick and easy you are usually one of my choices! This Sonic happens to be not too far from my work and home, but I will no longer be visiting..... I will drive out of my way to spend my money somewhere else. Not only have I gone here 3 times and been un happy with the food, the service...... is beyond ridiculous. Most Sonics are employed with younger high school kids...... lets get them to get their acts together specifically at this location. Each of my visits has ended with awful customer service, or just plain bad food. This last visit was the last straw for me! Throwing food out through the drive though window is unprofessional and rude, being rude and a smart patooty (yes I just said patooty) is also not appreciated and frankly absurd since your job at the drive through is customer service!!! These kids should be happy to have a job at all in this economy. After experiencing that I get to work to eat my food and..... YUCK is all I can say! The foot long chili cheese coney I received was inedible, I attached a wonderful picture of me picking through the hot dog as for the whole thing looked like this.... decide for yourself if you would eat it.  Needless to say I am pretty hangry and cant wait to get off work and enjoy fast food from any where else but Sonic.
2	nBJtAjcqtdvwe4UVW4R0dg	If there weren't better options in Charlotte, I would probably rate this place a 3 or 3.5 but there are better.  The food wasn't bad; it just wasn't anything special.  The prices weren't any better than any other place either.  My main complaint was that the cheese used in the enchiladas was a wierd yellow color instead of the white cheese used in most other Mexican restaurants.  The taste was off as well.
4	vmYrzRxmP56PVpMchJ5YqQ	Showmar's, like many of the restaurants in Charlotte, is owned by a Greek family and features American meets Greek food at their chain of locations.  Showmars does american greek better than the most, and they are typically quite busy, especially during lunch time.  I recommend the chicken fiesta pita if you want to go Greek, or the all-american pita burger if you want something less traditional.
4	Sqq0Equ4C8ew8obq4eg3Q	I'm currently in the middle of a rigorously controlled scientific experiment...it involves subjecting a "youngish" middle aged man to periods of intense physical exercise to "detoxify" him and then "retoxifying" him with things like Long Wong hot dogs and wings, mere moments later:)  After Power Yoga on Friday, I really needed to "tox up" and I met a buddy at Long Wongs.  I had my standard...2 Long Wongs and a frosty diet beverage, and my buddy got a dozen spicy and a dozen teryaki wings (and I thought I could eat:)  I had not tried the wings before, so I did end up "helping" to dispose of them:)  I am not generally a major fan of wings, but these little chicken parts were really good...esp. the teryaki wings...wonderfully deep teryaki flavor and a nice heat to go with it:)  And, in a major coup for a real "hole in the wall" kind of place...they proudly display the "Gold Award  - Zero Violations" from their last health inspection...I always knew they were clean as whistle...even though I can still smell the urinal cakes:)   Let's take them to 4 stars for the terrific teryaki wings:-)
4	rgB5sWk6Vmd6ffDawqW1Q	A staple for Verona residents.  Good consistent bar food with cold beer.  Excellent specials daily - you are very lucky if they have the salad bar open.  I love a true Wisconsin salad bar - fresh bacon, cottage cheese, hard boiled eggs, homemake croutons, peas, beans, blue cheese dressing, and so much more.  My husband adores the hot wings - slightly crunchy, meaty and plenty of sauce.   They have an enormous hamburger - I saw someone eat it . . . to much for me, but that guy looked very happy, his wife on the other hand - disgusted.  The owner is their frequently, very personable and good with his staff and customers.
4	AwVw5sQF8e0xucZD1UzN2A	Love the salsa, which is always a good indicator about whether or not the food will be worth the calories at a Mexican food restaurant.  It had a little kick and some pickled jalapenos mixed in to give it a distinct flavor.  The chili con queso also had a chipotle flavor, which was killer.  The food was very good and we were extremely full and satisfied at the end of our meal.  I was so full that I could not take advantage of the free sopapillas.  I never expect much for service at chain restaurants; however, this was an exception to the rule.  Our waiter was awesome.  He was on top of everything, including the five diet cokes we each drank (hungover).  Being a fan of Tex-Mex, this restaurant satisfies that aspect as well as New Mexican style.
4	Lxd9H2RZZWwUoGngKV9NQ	I used to rock this joint on lunch at Moon Valley High School across the street.  This is the best -bertos type place in the area, not fili b's, not Ramiro's, not Rolando's.  Humberto's.  Best Carne Asada in the area.
2	sKSFAL8VxuhCWdZTflINvA	Last time we came here, it was a busy Saturday night and after being seated, the staff had no idea. After waiting for 15 minutes, we notified the bouncer and had to wait an additional 5 minutes. At that point we left and still saw no sign of the waitress.  2 stars for half price drafts on Wednesday.
4	7gV35V9fZJe3ZhosZtYQ	Ok I know there are probably upwards a thousand 'bertos restaurants in the Valley, but Hilbertos is one of the best I've been to.   It's really close to where I work so I go there almost every morning as my morning ritual for breakfast. The ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is simple, but amazing all at the same time. It blows McDonald's and Burger King's burritos out of the water! I usually get the green sauce to go with it. The red sauce is good too, but I like green better.   The service there is quick and to the point so you can get in and get out really quick.   The building used to be a Taco Bell so there is plenty of seating. I'm usually on the go so I don't eat there.   Very good restaurant!
2	pljOqLqo2TRDMmSkTKIYw	I checked out this place with an Eversave deal. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. It tasted alright, but I left hungry and ended up getting a salad at McDonald's after I left. There was maybe 3 oz. of chicken on the plate, but I really think it was closer to 2 oz. The rice serving was about 1/2 cup. For around $8 I expected more. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
2	nF8UttSNu33gc1XTpyBQtA	Very disappointed!!  I picked this place because of the reviews that I've read here.  I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth.  We started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start).  For our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side.  The lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.    When we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen.  All this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.  My wife's gumbo was a little bland....almost like the roux was a little weak.   I really wanted to like this place.  After our first experience, I won't likely go back.
2	Ou6lvkZmWpvUkDs5nsWWQQ	Let the record show that I would never, EVER elect to eat here, but I was staying in the Flamingo for work and Hamada doesn't serve breakfast.   Weird jiggly oatmeal, and sliced bananas cost a whopping extra $2.  Gaggles of enormous people in shorts and fannypacks and crew cuts (men and women), all yelling at each other from across the way.  I struggled to find a reason to spare this population from quick and searing death had I been granted merciless deity privileges for the day.   That was not whip cream atop my chocolate malt.  That was pale slime.
2	cctvvZE5i6uLPTD6yzBHQ	I'm a big fan of buffets.  But this buffet definitely had that "old hotel" feel, and the food was just OK.  The food was similar quality to Old Country Buffet (not to put OCB down, but at least their price is on point with the quality of their food!)  Just having arrived from our morning flight, we were practically starving when we got to the hotel.  After checking in, we immediately went downstairs to the buffet.  Luckily we used our resort credit of $30 that we got when we booked the room, because for free, the food was fine.  We went here around 11ish am, so they were transitioning between breakfast and lunch.    PROS:  I have to disagree with the reviewers that said they had no fruit selection or a good dessert area - since they had both!  They had a nice selection of fresh fruit, and the dessert area was nice!  They had little slices of different cakes and tarts (my fav!) - and they even had a crepes station.  Their bread pudding was delicious, although I've had better elsewhere.  I ate two servings!  :)  They also had a nice selection of cheese, and BBQ ribs were good.  This was the prime location to watch the flamingos from inside, too.  CONS:  It was I think $16 per person, which for the quality of the food it should have been closer to $9.99.  I didn't touch anything on the salad bar, it all looked old and unappetizing.  Even the person sitting next to us we overheard saying the same thing.  I did manage to get some mixed corn from there but it had no flavor.  They also had ceviche, which was questionable since I wasn't sure how long it had been sitting out, but tasted ok and I didn't get sick from it!     In conclusion, this place was ok for free, and for starving people.  Otherwise, there are way better buffets in Vegas than this just a few minutes walk away!
2	tGCFLT1GlSMpN70NXsjsmg	We hit this place while vacationing in Phoenix over the New Years week.  First, the pizza was really good - we had a margharita pizza that was really flavorful.  But it almost doesn't matter because the counter girls gave the impression that you were an annoyance to their conversation.  I showed up to pick up the pizza, and they were chatting away.  The one girl took my card and charged it, while the other girl slid my pizza to me across the counter.  No "thank you's", just back to discussion.  I don't need this kind of crap, and would go to another pizza place just to avoid the counter staff.
2	5QmGWmwaw65WEWH2z5G7LQ	This location is outdated and slow. Quality of food is sad. Today's visit is probably my last to this location. You can only burn me so many times before I give up. I have gotten nasty salads, a joke of a chicken sandwich and very slow service for the last time. I'm done. I noticed another review said how busy they always are. It's because they are so slow. That location could do so much more. They apparently have already alienated most of the locals.
4	7g4k0b6QBT4MocGEUerx1A	I'd like to upgrade my first review based on the food. This time the pizza was cooked perfectly from top to bottom. Now I am.anxious to go back for myself and not just as a cheap alternative for the kids.
2	Hl7f78c4p7DtE41EZ15NKg	After reading the reviews of this restaurant's other locations, I am at a complete loss for words -- is this supposed to be some great local gem or something? What it seemed like to me was a big old Mexican chain restaurant full of overpriced cheddar-filled enchiladas. It wasn't *bad* food, but it was unremarkable. I came here for lunch and was seated promptly. The chips and salsa were quite tasty. I was surprised to see the prices on the lunch menu, though -- $10-$11 for vegetarian dishes like cheese enchiladas or a veggie burrito seemed really high. I went with the burrito, enchilada style. It tasted good. The tortilla was a bit chewy but the veggies were nice.  Ok. That's it. I get that this is supposed to be "Mexican city" style food, whatever that means. I didn't really notice that it had unique flavors to Mexico city, or any other region of Mexico, for that matter. Sigh.  I STILL haven't found a fantastic Mexican restaurant in this city of, what, 5 million people? I'm getting really frustrated. It's been three years! On to the next one...
2	vP24cxbaE1iWECg4UQaJbw	Brooklyn Bagels is a all around good alternative to Einstein if your not fortunate enough to have one close by.  The stores are usual smaller than most Einstein's and offer a lot less selection wise.  The bagels are good not great but then again it's hard for someone from the East coast to really enjoy a bagel or a donut out west.
4	RR9VVx2qeUxUk3IRSoEJA	OK, good news first.  The pan roast is still the best you will find anywhere even though the price is now up to $17.99.  The bad news is that you can only get the pan roast now at the bar.  You can no longer order pan roast if you go inside the restaurant and sit down.  The wait is also excruciating.  I went there on a Wednesday night.  Not exactly a time where the casino is packed.  There was only 1 waitress and 1 cook for 18 seats.  I counted because I was standing in line for 40 minutes!  I just stood there and watch customer after customer get up and leave after they finished their meal but there was no one to clear out their plates and tell the next person to sit down.  It was hard for me to get mad at the waitress since she had to take all the orders, bring out all the drinks, take care of all the checks, serve soup & salad, and clear the plates.   So after 10 seats opened up, the waitress finally got around to seating the 6 people waiting in line.  Then, of course, there was another 20 minute wait for the food.  Total time waiting 1 hr 30 minutes.... on a Wednesday night!  If you want a good pan roast go here.  Just don't expect to get it very quickly.
2	PijJlwAgxKXXRaEqoT5g	I know this place is very popular with people in the west island but every time I go to this restaurant for some kind of special occasion, scheduled by people from the neighbourhood. The food both meat and pasta taste like they came from a can or at least reheated after being made in an industrial kitchen. I fear this restaurant is a waste of time the only good thing about it is the parking. Do your selves a favour and stay away.
2	yN1KBOZUdXjgC0O7EKitUA	I don't know what happened to the Egg Foo Young since I first tried it, but I no longer recommend it. The patties are smaller and the gravy was thinner and tasted watered down. What a disappointment!
4	Guul7o1vDQVk7cbhJnAwQ	Had a Thai peanut and chicken salad. Very good. The only thing I would change is I would add almonds. The dressing was delicious. It was fresh and the service was great. I love au bon pain and even though they're pricey I think it's worth it.
2	atMklzdQvJEhlGoHjohg	Nous avons pris des d\u00e9jeuners 2x en takeout. C'\u00e9tait bon, rien d'exceptionnel.  Le pain dor\u00e9 croustillant a vraiment bon go\u00fbt.   Par contre pour les smooties....\u00e7a fait vraiment dur ! \u00c7a go\u00fbte la cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e m\u00e9lang\u00e9e avec de l'eau, ce qui est vraiment d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able le matin.
4	BO7aMR4RffEj94EbnWtYA	Simple, well made pizza and other typical pizzeria fair.   Portions of the pizzas are sadly not justified by their price. Too many nights ordering from Portos dropping over $15 and still hungry.   Perfect portions for lunches.
2	6IOMLa6ia9NjMyS8dRdwrQ	Maybe I caught this place on a bad night, but my friend and I were left greatly disappointed. We had great expectations after eating at Delux multiple times that this place just did not live up to.  I really liked the decor of Stax and even the menu selection. A cucumber slice in the water was a good touch. We ordered buffalo and beef sliders with hopes of juicy, delicious meat.  We received dry, bland hockey pucks. :(  The meat was just not good. I'm probably not going back here.
4	smSDEgckiXdpVHcwTRZSiQ	went here on my way home from a Badger game. not a bad spot at all. was pretty quiet when we arrived, probably due to the fact we showed up after lunch and before the dinner crowd. clean place, plenty of TV's to watch whatever sport you're interested in and a great view of the 18th hole   i ordered the Roost Burger and wasn't disappointed. a burger with an over easy egg and bacon on top? sign me up. Very messy but worth it. i managed to eat it without getting it all over myself or all over the bar. for the win. the fries that came with it were great as well.   overall definitely a good spot to have a nice lunch or dinner. hopefully i'll be back to check out the huge deck overlooking the golf course and some houses in a nice neighborhood.   oh, and also.  there was only the bartender and one server when we arrived. the server didn't seem dopey and as far as being hot. well, he wasn't my type.
2	b8a6lT2cc2PHvftfqC82Kg	(Ben writing in Keewi's account)  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't much good.  The server was friendly, but very distracted chatting with her friends, so it was hard to catch her eye.  The bread was a bit burned, enough to be black in spots and taste like carbon.  The linguini alla vongole came in an alfredo sauce, of all things, not the white wine sauce it's supposed to have.  The clams were canned, and gritty with sand.  The pasta was overcooked, not al dente.  The soup was oversalted.  The fried calamari's breading was soft and chewy and oily, not crisp.  The mussels appetizer was the best part of the meal, and it was just OK, not divine.  The prices are low, so if that's all that matters to you, then there you are.  And there may be better things on the menu that we didn't try.  But we will not be going back to find out.
4	6D2dwEIvCbSYFXVfG4cFIA	I had lunch with Jacob L. in this rather charming little gem in Sunnyslope. The restaurant is bright, clean, and cheerfully decorated. The food was tasty and inexpensive. The rice and beans that came with my order were good. Of the 3 tacos I tried, I liked the pastor the best - it was really tasty; the carne asada was good, and the tongue was not as flavorful as I had expected but still OK (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wQ4qreKh5KMxoo2WjsZumw/l). Good quality food, so  I'm definitely coming back here - probably on a weekend, to try the other dishes - especially the menudo. And of course I HAVE to get the flan.
4	UNRR0cuo5D6MiF5LVERoA	Tom's Bbq serves up very good bbq, some of the best you'll find in Phoenix.   Tom's serves up Chicago style bbq, so not only do they have some very good bbq plates, they also have some non bbq Chicago staples.   The bbq pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches are above average. The Chicago staples on the menu such as the Italian Beef sandwich, Italian Sausage, and Vienna Beef Hot Dog are also very good.   Good Chicago style menu, fast and friendly service, and reasonable prices, gives Tom's Bbq an above average rating of four stars.
4	Py7gL24s9dYRUP2YFZMpgw	I am a huge fan of gyros and greek food and try all different places and this one is a great one. I ordered the Gyro/Fries./Drink combo and it was great. The gyro was over flowing with meat with just the right amount of veggies and lettuce. The tzatziki sauce was applied in the right amount to get every bite and was very good. The fries are wonderful as was said by another reviewer. They were nice and crispy outside but soft and cooked well inside, they are also thicker somewhere between a McDonalds fire and steak house steak fry. The only thing that keeps me from giving a full 5 star was some of my meat was a little dry. Overall I really like it and will come back for more.
2	1HJ8SMoDfkvXRMIhlFfcA	Came here for lunch and boy did I regret it. While I didn't necessarily experience the terrible service other Yelpers have reported I can boldly state that the Pad Thai I got was very disappointing! If you want "Thai" food that is extra salty with lots of soya, this is the place to go. How something made to be awesome be taste so bland and generic is beyond me.  It's cheap but you certainly get what you paid for.,
4	sOTefUhPDlZOw5riN9WRQ	This my second maybe first favorite place to hang out. Why you ask second/first depends on the season.  I'm a hard core Raider fan this a cowboy bar.  But haven't had a bad experience yet.  Besides that love the food the club sandwich and philly are the best in vegas.  Bike nite is a must if you ride.  This place is not high end so... for you pendejos that want to pay high price for drinks this is not the place for you.  But if you want a great place to kick back with your friends, meet new ones and have a cheap pitcher of beer and have a good time come down no bike is necessary but if you have one bring it down. See you there on bike nite on Wednesday.  EvilRaider out.
4	18mRTkJjFJ3LyqIOyaICQ	This place is the closest you will find to the real deal (south of the border style) in old town...  if you are a gringo you might be out numbered but the food is pretty good... if you don't speak Spanish you can point to what you would like... this is so real you can actually get gut tacos (i was not a fan... too chewy)...  if i were you i would get the quesadilla... just had it for lunch today and I don't want to try anything else...   you know this place is the real deal when they serve you the Mexican bottle and have the recycling create where you throw the stuff away... i would recommend this place for the adventurous (and those that have stomachs of steel)... but check it out... nice lil gem...
4	8cBzRL4hq9VGMLmScXICxQ	What I love most about this place is their biscuits and cheap prices. Biscuits are the best I've had, crispy sweet top with a soft inside, soooo good. Chicken has a very crispy crust. I got the 5 piece with two biscuits for only $5... Such a deal for two people.
2	BuKBxQgQISOsmIruH4OlHA	I only have been here when others I am out with pick it.  If it was my choice,  I would steer clear.  The prices are higher for mediocre food.  The lighting is too dark for my preference.  The place has many Sun City residents visiting/long waits to get a table.  No point doing a call ahead,  you still wait (we called ahead but waited 45 minutes after our time slot). And the staff rush you through so that they can get the next group through.
2	H4voNUp1UQevsrkIClfjsw	Placed order with Eat24. Took nearly 45 minutes to get my order- got the impression that they didn't even start cooking it until I showed up. Food quality is very mixed- tasty dishes with low-quality ingredients rendering the dishes themselves poor.  THAI CHICKEN WINGS appetizer- tasty six-piece order of wings with extra sauce, delicious aroma was a bit better than the actual taste.   KANA MHOO KROP (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and oyster sauce)- portion is half the size of other entr\u00e9e ordered, and pork used in this dish is either super dry/old or fatty. Could not eat the protein in this dish. If I wanted just Chinese broccoli, I would have ordered that. I didn't pay $10 for this dish to consist of pork jerky and broccoli. I will say that the sauce was tasty though.  PAD SEE EW- ordered this medium heat with beef and it was a huge step up from mild and the protein was also tough in this dish. Overall it wasn't bad though.   TOM KHA- soup was delicious! Pleasant surprise. Good size portion, good complexity of flavor, plentiful tomato and mushrooms. Unfortunately, also plentiful chunks of ginger, comparable in size to the pieces of chicken. Tasty though!  Service was polite but very slow. Placed order, waited 15 minutes to leave, arrived around 25 minutes after placing order. Waited an additional half hour. No other patrons were present.   Order also asked for an additional cup of oyster sauce on the side, but they were unable to do so, saying that they didn't have packets of this condiment. I asked if it could be put in a small plastic cup, they said they couldn't do that because they have the oyster sauce in a huge gallon-size container in the back, and they would have to open the container in order to get me some. I'm baffled as to how on earth they managed to get the sauce into my dish but are completely unable to put it in a cup.  Food quality was such that it seemed a great recipe was being used for these dishes- someone clearly knows their business with this cuisine. However, the cook is either limited to low-quality ingredients or simply does not care, because the actual execution is lackluster.
4	puNbORbwTXtQdV2UzI7TQ	43rd Express is the definition of a hole in the wall place. The outside looks less appealing, the inside even less, but then the food comes out and you are oh so glad to be there. We ordered the steak pho and a pork dish that came with the broken rice, a sunny side up egg, and something else we couldn't really identify. It tasted a little fishy... not sure what it was, I wasn't a fan, but my husband seemed to enjoy it.   The pho broth was very flavorful and came with fresh basil and bean sprouts. The portion was more than enough and prices where very reasonable.   Don't forget to check in and get your free drink. I ordered the fresh orange juice, which in fact was fresh with pulp and seed. My husband got the fresh lemonade, which was very tasty as well.
2	DNF0GSx0fsKAA8PF9g3A	Food is mediocre. Brunch falls completely flat. Wait staff are somewhat nice, bartenders tend to be nicer. I would go for a drink if everywhere else was full, otherwise, I've seen people wait for 50+ minutes for their food. No thanks,
4	DSnfOZd9xQ1VqZnMZH5uQ	This review is mostly for brunch because I think it's what they really excel at. I've had dinner here once and I think it was good... but a little unmemorable. The brunch, on the other hand is awesome.  Their eggs benedicts are really delicious, especially the artichoke, which is my favorite. My most recent visit I got the crab cakes and I didn't love it, but the sauces and creamy and very tasty. If you like sweets, I highly recommend the Bananas Foster French Toast - it's unbeatable! My boyfriend literally said, "I can never finish 4 pieces of French toast except here." They're that good. The cheese grits are a nice side with anything. I don't love their potatoes because they're very creamy and heavy.   They have nice seating outside if you happen to be in Madison during the 3 months when it's warm enough to consider it. Make sure to make reservations for Sunday brunch - they get very busy.
2	tAR9xF9JAjGOI03oBGKYg	Ah, Iguana Mack's. There are so many words that are on the tip of my tongue, but they are far too explicit for a virgin yelper's eyes, so I shall opt for the "sugar-coating" route.  If you are a fellow Chandler resident, you can truly empathize with the fact that there aren't many bars to choose from (atleast, not to my knowledge). Being a closet alcoholic, I want to choose a bar that's atleast within a ten mile radius so I can sober up, and drive home without attracting a cop's attention. (Warning: Do not attempt to try at home.) Occasionally, when Tempe seems miles away, and Scottsdale isn't even an option, I go to Iguana Mack's with my friends.  The first time, I had a joyful experience. The bar was packed, the alcohol was flowing through my bloodstream, the packed, small dance floor seemed appealing, and the liquor impaired my taste in men and dancing partners. However, when I decided to go to Iguana Mack's again, I realized how horribly slow the service is, and how inattentive the bartenders are. I decided that it was endurable, and decided to give Iguana Mack's another shot - I adamantly believe in equality and justice.  Can I say RUDE, RUDE, RUDE? Horrible, horrible service. The food is mediocre, at best. I suppose when you're boozing, you aren't overly particular about your choice in foods. I would have had an alright time if it weren't for the rude servers.  Other than that, this place is happening, by Chandler standards...it's densely packed on Thursday nights. However, I'd rather risk a couple more miles and go to Maloney's in Tempe.
4	CtjT9pBlLB3iWN7QUsx5eA	As it's name suggests, Nam's Noodle's best dishes are indeed Chinese noodles and Vietnamese pho. There's a good selection here and it is more expensive than most other Asian restaurants, but the food isn't bad.   In my opinion, the clutch items on the menu at Nam's Noodle is the Vietnamese sandwiches. Although it's just okay here, I couldn't find this specialty anywhere else in Madison. In addition, I like that this place offers bubble tea (and a semi-full bar well).  But even better is the fact that this place has karaoke rooms!! I've actually been a more frequent patron of their karaoke systems than their food. They've recently installed a new system and their software is actually constantly updated and pretty legit, offering the newest English, Chinese, and Korean songs. The owner is pretty nice too and on occasion has charged my friends and I less per hour when there are fewer customers.
4	02H1RTIh9tO5igxcBMI9w	Didn't have big expectations but was pleasantly surprised. We were looking for a quick lunch before a spring training game.  Our server/ bartender recommended the shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. Flicka himself brought us our food, introduced himself and chatted with us a bit. Looks like it would be a fun night time spot.
4	tyyrFUejZxjmkfeasJ3Ig	Went during lunch over the weekend, and it was easily one of the very best Indian buffets I've had a chance to eat at.  The spinach and mushroom dish was delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options here.  Whereas it doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment bar; chutneys, raita, kheer, etc, was one of the most complete I've seen.  Will head there again.
4	VCYD9n8WXtoZPj0N2lkIw	very good pizza, great customer service but the Oktoberfest was stale! how could they neglect such a good beer like that. it is for this reason that I'm not giving five stars. my buddy and I went and it was a very nice crowd. super good crust
4	EgqpUcgbKiuYo1OygNvHsA	I love FRESH bagels and Einstein has a great selection! This is my go-to place if I'm in a rush and just need a bagel and coffee to-GO. They also have bagel sandwiches and even pre-packed salads.   My favorite is their Honey Wheat Thin bagel and the Cranberry Bagel.   Service is fast. You place your order at the first counter and pay at the second counter.
2	fdLb7mZnDQV66yo5BuJ2A	I went last night with 5 friends.  They all liked it.  I wasn't impressed AT ALL.  The people working were young and nice.  The food is just so simple and boring.  Something you could make at home just as easily.  I tried the confetti flat bread (not on the menu but recommended to me by the empolyees.).  A flat bread with salsa as the sauce and then different vegetables- roasted red pepper, corn, sundried tomatoes and a few other things topped with mozzarella cheese and baked.  All the veggies tasted canned.  It was edible but for that and a Sobe drink I paid over $9.  I wouldn't go back.
2	OMmhJUq9lFWk1EzMcEDJxw	Food's decent enough for a restaurant that mainly serves students. Because of such, their selection is limited to the most common Korean dishes like pork bone soup or bibimbap - the quality of which is just tolerable. They offer lunch discounts from 12-3 on some of their most popular dishes.  For the most part I'd stick to the pork bone soup, tonkatsu and bulgogi. Their other dishes were very bland. If you want Korean food close to campus (uWaterloo), this is probably the best you're gonna get. (I do however really like their sweet potatoes :3)
4	Kds9XSlkvzs7PXGjewSQw	The other night after picking my kid up from day care and too tired to cook, I decided that I wanted pizza and was curious to try NYP&P.  Since that evening, I've been back a second time because the pizza is pretty good.  They serve large slices, have fresh toppings, great sauce - not what you'd expect from a strip plaza in Indian Trail.    BUT don't forget that half of New Jersey and New York live now live in Union County and they're opening some pretty fabulous restaurants.    A big surprise are the deserts.  For $3, you can have a monster slice of cake or cheesecake and both are delish.  There's even a buffet for lunch or dinner.    I think what I like most about this place is that it's a great place to just enjoy a slice, enjoy talking with friends, without the distractions of a million tv's.
4	WTsomXtaF2KjDrfCZVNaQ	I've lived in this neighborhood my entire life but tried Ned's for the first time about a couple of weeks ago. It's a favorite around the area so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm typically not a huge sandwich fan but I actually thought it was pretty good. The hubs and I shared the super samich and it wasn't bad. The guy working was really nice and helpful so this past week I decided to grab one on my way into work. I called the order in but when I went to pick it up realized I had called the order into the location on Southern, not the location on McKellips. OOPS! The guy working was super nice about it and made me a new one right there, in just a couple of minutes! It was very fast, friendly service and I was surprised at how understanding they were about the mix up. I will definitely be going back again and again!
4	mWPSQnUJOH8ejCVbVk7Q4w	Had curry goat with rice and peas and cabbage. I also tried my friends Brown stewed red snapper it was delicious. My goat was tender and delicious as well. They didn't have plantains but they had Kola champagne which is a delicious soda that taste like sweet cream soda. The service was fair. It was a little busy but handled well.
2	cSs6a1eaHFJPziSPgSQTYQ	The food is authentic but I have had better Ethiopian food. Not sure what the other options in Vegas are - but try awash in Los Angeles. That is in a league of it's own and after eating there this place first not stack up. I would not come back here.
2	GRu80GzzFouU1M0v0R2wg	Extremely disappointed with this place.  Friends recommended it, but I certainly will not.  We both ordered short rib  chile rellenos but neither one of us could find ANY meat in our dish.  Very limited wine list and very poor service.  Our waiter delivered the food but then disappeared and we had to ask a bus boy to find him to get our check.  No water refills, no asking how everything was, no asking if we would like another drink, he was just gone!  When we asked where the meat had been he didn't apologize or offer to find out what happened.  Lovely patio setting is the only reason I am giving it two stars.  Oh, and small $15 margaritas - - - come on, really?  First time my extremely generous tipping husband left no tip at all.  Certainly not a Four Seasons caliber restaurant.
2	T9FBMjYrHEagZE3W31eaw	Typical McDonalds, nothing special about this location and customer/employee interaction has room for development, I feel like the staff are robots. No smiling, no greetings at the drive thru windows, just the price at the first window and when I get my food at #2 just someone saying "Here!" and shoving it my way.
2	ZzruqbiMqkbJwQNCMxGvFw	Very very expensive! I did not like the sandwich I got which was some gorgonzola, walnut, watercress/celery concoction but my boyfriend enjoyed his roast beef on a roll. Dasani water is $3. Our meal total $23. RipOff.
4	mwlAb8q1RdVJGd21pUxUYg	I just had supper here. This Panda Express did not let me down. Upon entering the restaurant, they greeted me with a 'welcome to Panda.' The entrees were just cooked. They gave me a nice portion. The restaurant has an atmosphere that is more casual than fast food. The instrumental music was a nice touch that provided for a casual fast food dining experience.   I eat at restaurants all over. This is one of many Panda Expresses that I dine at. So far it has not let me down.
4	JBO0WdE4yKpANhVp6GgfwA	They have thick crust pizza! Since I've moved to Pittsburgh, I've been on the hunt for great think crust pizza ... and now I have two places to go (here and Pizza Perfecta in Shadyside)!  I got the Chicago style pizza - which I think was great! I definitely plan on coming back to try their other types of pizza.
4	IqXGV4Um2YeIbdAulJeMw	I don't think Harlow's Cafe is a four star place, but I definitely would give it 3.5 stars.  It's your typical old-fashioned greasy spoon coffee shop with burgundy 1970s style naugahyde booths, movie posters and old photos, but heavy on your typical ASU/Tempe crowd.  Harlow's makes you ask yourself the following questions.  Is Burt Reynolds here? How clogged are my arteries getting right now? Why can't more breakfast places have this dated look?  The food and service were pretty good.  Our waitress hopped to it when we said we were in a hurry.   I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham eggs cheese (and a surprisingly spicy salsa) and minced hash browns and gobbled it up before you could say "Dukes of Hazzard".   Personally, I prefer my hash browns without all the extras.  I tried a bit of my brunch date's chorizo egg scramble, and it was a respectable effort of something I'm usually very critical of.  If you can, check it out on a weekday, go to the bathroom at home (unless you dig that cramped feeling).  I echo other comments on the priceyness of the entrees.  It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but it's worth a stop if you live nearby or are in Tempe.
2	DrJbyrTBYPGYdBzsewiMQ	I have to say I'm actually kind of disappointed. After seeing all the reviews on yelp I was very excited to spend the extra money for a really fancy meal. I got the prime rib and king crab legs and my husband got the prime rib and lobster. The prime rib was bland, the au ju was ok, wasn't that flavorful. The lobster was wood grilled and semi burnt. The king crab is the only thing worth it here. The service was good, but waiters kept coming up to us and we weren't sure who was our waiter at one point. All in all my meal was $77 and my husbands meal was $77. The bill came up to $168 plus tip so we spent $190 for an ok meal. Expected better. The silk noodle and sids diner is amazing though! Highly recommend those!
4	heflrrFkuF4JaLbMaqaZaA	Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. A good, safe bet for Chinese food.
2	XA2CkoyfIClMtN1cPlDLg	To my utter dismay, this is the only sushi place in Southern Highlands area.  We went on a weeknight and it was jam packed so our expectations were pretty high.  Their service was good but it doesn't make up for their sub par food.  The cucumber salad, edamame, and every roll we tried did not taste fresh at all.  Thank goodness we didn't do the "all you can eat" special.    One thing's for sure - this place was an Xtreme disappointment with a capital X.
4	goON7ixvITcJcf50zxfYeg	I love Yvonne's! They have an awesome $2.99 daily special.  Aw man, the biscuits and gravy on Wednesdays are really good.  They are pretty fast on the delivery as well. They are one of the few places that deliver to my office early in the morning.  It is our go to place to order breakfast.
4	Zes4Dwhafw80bGxfxEJ8dA	This place has great food.  I love the chicken and black beans, but anything with their jaco sauce is great.  Their food has a little bit of a southwestern feel- they offer bbq, tacos, and have fabulous cornbread.  The only negative I have about this place is that most things come with side items, but the side items vary daily.  This is a great place for takeout.
2	HrwJmNRnOTjHDUeomJdP9Q	So it's late and you are craving tacos and beans. You hit the drive thru, request double beans in place of rice and beans (because you love lard AND dislike Mexican rice). You pay, drive home, lay your purchase on the coffee table.  The table strains to hold all of the goodness contained in that styrofoam clamshell.  You open it up and ... find no beans and about three pounds of rice. Fail Filibertos, double rice fail.
4	h3yviDDCVlwntX3a3EoMQ	I stop in here every now and then for a Pastrami on a smiley. As everyone says its the bread that makes it. You can buy the bread but I think you have to order in advance for larger orders. The pastrami I had today was saltier than usual but still pretty good. nice staff, clean place. you can buy Board head meats and cheeses by the pound as well.
4	Jgh2KwRIdrg5CwH5p65lw	Best subs I have EVER had.  Uncle Sam's special is bomb diggity. Bread = awesome. Meat = awesome. Overall just a huge great experience eating here. And I don't think you can get bored of this place with their wide menu. Just excellent. Love coming here with schoolmates.
4	lHcx0Y9A296GFuX6yboBzw	This was one of my favourite coffee shops to go to in Madison because it was more inviting than most of the coffee shops present. (I was intimidated by not being "hipster enough" at many of them. They have some food items and there is plenty of seating. What is funny about this coffee house is it seems EVERYONE comes here to work on their laptops...it is rare to find anyone talking. There are couches, which I loved. It is nice to be able to be so relaxed and feel at home without your strung our, high roommates talking to the walls...  ...oh you don't have that problem? It is rather frequent in Madison...
4	4pCD6dI2bFw9kaoS9k2zYg	I've been eating at Pepe's for years. The taco siberia and taco monterey are definite high points. The egg/breakfast stuff is also surprisingly good. I don't drink much anymore, but I'd head straight here if I had a hangover.   P.S. If any of you remember doing a slow burn when Pepe's was cash-only, those days are long gone.
2	G59zibWNNUBK18FzDqI1w	I've been here on several occasions. Like most Steak 'n Shakes, the food is below average to average. The service is on par with the food. What strikes me as odd is the way there is always a huge kitchen staff but the wait staff can be so slow at time. It makes me wonder how much more efficient could be. Usually, it's really difficult to flag down a server to get another drink or to even take your order. Even after your order is placed, it can take up to 20-25 minutes for the food and drinks to come out. On top of that, it feels cramped in the place. I'm not a huge fan and will only go when others want to go, but even the food isn't great. I'd prefer a burger from Zelma's or Wendy's or Chili's over Steak 'n Shake.
4	BqPZdeICXwLRaGaXDbInJg	For lunch we shared a bowl of pho tai (rare steak) accompanied by fresh basil, herbs, lemon and bean sprouts.  A liberal skirt of Sriracha chili and I was happy.  We also shared a delicious order of goi cuon (steamed egg rolls with shrimp, noodles and veggies) with a peanut dipping sauce. Highly recommended for anything that ails you.
2	8zFNR6vjDd6j3OmXK5WPNA	Just in recently, and had the misfortune of listening to the screams of some ladies leather lunged kid, who was also biting its adult keeper. Consider yourselves warned.  Also, Yola's needs signs placed around to remind customers to please pick up there dishes & place them in the bins against the wall when they are through. I've seen tables of people walk right out the door with everything left on the table when the staff is really being slammed and cannot pull away to clean up the table.
4	8ClRn6Fupj8Crk5VMveALQ	I stopped by here on my way back to my office. Found it on yelp and figured "what the heck". So I stooped in, pretty slow just one table was seated. I wanted a take out. The waitress who took my order was a bit outta it or just shy.   I got a chicken gyro, fries, and a coke. All for under $7. It was HUGE, I ate half the fries, half the gyro, and half the soda. Which is probably good for my heart and overall well being. Nonetheless it's a pretty decent little spot.
4	0MaOHgvyVZbrINE2GDGTow	We usually come here for late-night cravings. (They close at 2:00am).  I love the duck, and the price is pretty good.  The crispy pan-fried noodles are bomb, too.  I wouldn't suggest coming here alone because they give really big portions and you probably won't finish it.  Come with friends and share the dishes.  They give you hot tea as the default drink so you should ask for water if you want.  The rice is good and has a good consistency.  Also, they give this red bean soup that's pretty good as a complimentary dessert.  Either that or fortune cookies.  Hopefully next time we go there, they give both.  I will definitely come again! ^_^
4	QFGik7nFWHgNKsSvTysiHg	great place to go with friends and unwind they have a great patio, and being in AZ that is everything (esp. if you smoke)  the menu is diverse the food is New Mexican, not mexican (being from Jersey i can not tell you what the difference is only that there is one).  portions are big, again catering to groups and making it more of a hang out then a date spot   go green chile!
2	Y8aArrf2dPLdlFClCbQg	I was disappointed when I initially went to the Henderson location, looking for good BBQ, only to see that they had discontinued that portion of their menu.  So I trekked all the way to this location only to find out why it wasn't very popular in the first place...  I got the cowboy plate with choice of three meats, so I wouldn't have to come back and sample anything:  1) The beef brisket was awful.  Hard and chewy.  Even though it was sliced thin, it somehow managed to resemble rubber.  2) The pork brisket tasted bad.  I don't know whether it was the sauce or the leftover pork they selected to make this.  Yuck.  3) The pork ribs were of the sparerib variety, which means it was full of meat but kind of tough and dry.  Definitely the star of the show, but I wouldn't call it the best by any stretch of the imagination.  So there we go.  Some of the worst BBQ I've tried in Vegas, and believe me, I've tried it all.  Never again.  If you do come here, stick with something simple like the wings...which still kind of taste dry, but at least they have the BBQ flavoring to them.
2	f7vhe5Ac9sAM5eEmXj2rkw	ON A SHOE STRING ? This place has a really nice tap beer selection. In the first months after they opened I went back 7 or 8 times until I had tried most all of them.   I tried three or four different menu items. The food was OK. Wife loved the crab cakes.   Service was always very friendly but they frequently seem to be operating with a skeleton crew. Like the same person is the hostess slash bartender slash waitress slash cook slash dishwasher. I usually just stopped in to try a different beer so when the server dissapeared for long stretches of time it wasn't that big a deal.   The atmosphere is a little off.  They have this great tap selection paired with a tiny 4 stool bar in a really big pub. Odd set up.  In another area their are some high tables right next to the main eating area which are booths. So you could be trying to eat a nice quiet restaurant style lunch just feet away from jukebox blasting, beer swilling, pool shooting hooligans. There is just something not right about the floor plan.  It is like they ran out of money before they could remodel the inside to fit the business.  I still visit every so often because they change up their draft beer selection. Unfortunately because of the atmosphere and staffing quirks it is not a place I can throw an extra star or two.
2	Z6CuvnUZ2OBkKVk43bE45g	A nice little place located in Chinatown.  The prices are like any other local bar.  The design inside is pretty nice with a small lounge area.  However, the place is dead.  There wasn't anybody inside on a Saturday night.  I guess that might be a good thing for some people.  However, I like to interact with a few other people.  The food isn't that great.  The best thing was probably the pot stickers.  I guess if you just want a quiet place to chill that feels pretty nice, this is a nice place to go.
2	lh0cMsiFNEJ9qzhhmK0FkQ	Standard, good Middle-Eastern food.  My date described the server as being "le serveur qui nous a bien fait rire".  I really felt for the guy because I understood that he wasn't clueless out of any bad emotion.
4	mLBtlIHhyFhJt7Zo53PheQ	We were in town for a conference and this was our second night's dinner choice.  We were not seated in the main dining area, but in the area tucked back by the river.  We had a great banquette and a lovely view.  The service started off a little slow but picked up as the meal went on, so that's the minus one star.    The food was great, we all had fish dishes and everyone was happy.  For dessert, we had cannollis and they were fantastic!  Really wonderful.    Overall, it was a great dining experience and while a little pricey, not out of the realm of what you get as far as food and ambiance compared to other citiies in the U.S.    Would visit again when in Pittsburgh.
4	45MwKIVhgYjWKbxnSO2tg	Totally an awesome experience. Uber friendly staff, great value for steaks and quick service.   Manager even checked in to see how are first dinning experience was going. The bread is fantastically nummy...
2	1SjpixjzpBQApP0ABrCiYQ	Tr\u00e8s "bof" pour la livraison, du moins. Tout est froid, m\u00eame la soupe. C'est tout dire... Le poulet saut\u00e9 tha\u00ef \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s ordinaire. Au fait, ou \u00e9tait le poulet? J'ai surtout trouv\u00e9 de gros morceaux de brocoli non pas al dente mais crus. Le riz \u00e9tait tellement cuit, on aurait dit une boule de p\u00e2te. Tr\u00e8s compact. La petite soupe pho de l'entr\u00e9e \u00e9tait correct mais on trouve mieux dans le quartier chinois. Rouleaux aux crevettes, vous dites? Mon Dieu! D'insipides crevettes enrob\u00e9es d'une p\u00e2te tout aussi insipide et blanche. Imaginez croquer dans \u00e7a quand c'est froid. Non, je n'ai pas aim\u00e9 du tout. Les deux \u00e9toiles vont principalement \u00e0 la soupe.
2	2tdyQFUAYDIeP5QQljJBg	Had planned to dine elsewhere but when that did not work out, we had heard good things from family so ultimately came here for lunch.  It was surprisingly quiet, which perhaps should have been our first clue.  Our drinks came quickly and our orders were taken and we started in on the chips and salsa.  It was fresh but a little watery for me.  The queso dip was blah.  It seemed to be lacking flavor and quickly hardened.  Three of the orders came quickly, but the fourth came MUCH later (at least 5 minutes) without any explanation or apology.  Our waiter seemed scattered and even spilled a pitcher of tea (thankfully not very close to our table).  We would ask for refills or extra chips etc, sometimes they would come, often we would have to remind him or our requests. The combination I chose was mediocre.  The chicken enchilada was just OK but thankfully topped it with the Baja sauce upon the suggestion of a family member.  The chili relleno had the thickest batter and was tasteless.  The black beans were seemingly straight from the can topped with a little cheese.  The highlight of my lunch was the bite of a fellow diners chicken tamale ... sweet and savory and topped with the baja sauce ... I found myself wishing I had followed her lead and ordered that instead ...
4	uKiNjk0rczFhJtkHOXJQ	This place is never very busy but always feels understaffed. I say this because even though there's never many people in the restaurant, you never get good attention from your waitress. This is probably due to her being torn in 50 directions because not only is she the hostess and waitress she's also the bartender! So I find it hard to judge soley on wait time alone. I've been in here plenty of times with the girls from work and we always get the same thing: cheese pizza and an order of Garlic knots. The pizza is delicious with Sams club comparable slices ;) and the garlic knots will keep the vampires away for months. Over all the food is great (at least what I've tried) if you can handle waiting a few extra minutes for service. Also, don't guzzle your drink all at once because that refill may never come.
2	ta2crUWgxYAc8Jccl60A	I'll start off by saying that I'm not a huge fan of the Epicentre, not that I don't drop in from time to time, just not a huge fan... (too many hipsters)  That being said, I decided to give Blackfinn a shot. I have now been in two or three times. The food is decent, nothing that will blow you away, but not bad either. The chicken sliders are good, as is the seared tuna salad. The waitstaff seems to be very friendly and attentive. The place can seem to draw in a large crowd on weekends, so the service suffers a bit (to be expected, I guess).   The beer selection is boring, only a handful of taps and they are mainly Bud, Miller, Coors type beers. At $7-$8 a beer I expected them to at least carry a couple of local or regional beers.   If you are at the Epicentre and are looking for a good place to have a beer, there are better places.  Over all this is not a bad place, but it's nothing special either...
2	LHAA99peS1tIKC4meUkLHw	The 2 stars are based solely on food. I admit I've never stepped foot into this place. A few sandwiches have been brought back to my office, each time not fulfilling my mid-day hunger attack. The main problem I have is the price. You basically get what seems to be a couple slices of souped-up Wonderbread with some Safeway-quality lunch meats then cooked with a George Foreman Grill. I think the prices are about $8 --- if they offer a 50% off special then go for it.
4	F6HuTzSQtxbBF4UNvPvrAg	Great breakfast or lunch stop ! Try the Chorizo Omelet for starters. They have great soups made fresh daily and build a mean club sandwich. I love this place because Its where real people go to eat. Situated in a largely industrial area that caters to local blue collar workers with a few suits thrown in.  The service is as great as the food, what more could you ask for.
4	j2O28wsXsPmfZwS73YbLA	The name does suggest some competition and what's funny is that you can't have better than sex cake without having the thoughtful discussion around is it or isn't it.   I'd dare say there's more sex being discussed at the little cafe tables than on an Oprah show.  My thoughts, it is good cake...
4	xNxP21aNHU7zDUCFLIYg	Great atmosphere, good sushi and a perfect way to kick off an evening on the town.  Ra is fun with groups, big or small.  Also, a good date spot if you don't mind how loud it is, even with the attractive waitstaff.  Worth a short wait, just grab a drink and check out all of the new colagen and botox.  It can be quite entertaining.
2	JiA1zsVOIMScI6lTmlIB0g	As someone who spent the last four years living in NYC, I'm very familiar with "New York style" pizza. In fact, I lived above Rosario's on the Lower East Side, where I'd grab a *perfect* pepperoni slice four times a week. So naturally I was excited to read about Napoli.  Expecting to be wowed, I dialed in a delivery order for an 18" pie with pepperoni and onions for about $18. When it arrived an hour later, the results were immediately disappointing.   First of all, let's make something clear. "New York style" pizza is not rocket science. It's defining quality is simplicity--a thin, floppy slice with fresh tomato sauce. When it's really good, there's a pool of grease on the surface that rolls down your arm. Shake some pepper flakes and powdered garlic on it and you're done. It should never be crispy, "doughy" or covered with pretentious crap. Anything beyond pepperoni is pushing it.   This pizza, on the other hand, was bready and sweet. The cheese formed a film which slid off in your mouth. I didn't find the ingredients especially flavorful, fresh or abundant. Adding insult to injury, there was a $3.50 delivery charge and the driver gave me lip for going "out of his way." In sum, it was typical suburban pizza, marginally better than the major chains but thoroughly pedestrian.   Now, I'll concede that the debate on what constitutes a true "New York style" pizza will undoubtedly continue raging for centuries. But here's two things to consider: 1) Not all pizza in New York is good. 2) Not all New Yorkers have good taste. In fact, many are perfectly happy with Sbarro and Domino's. I am not one of them. Indeed, I feel a certain responsibility to defend the "New York" monicker from those who would profit from its misuse. If my critique of Napoli seems harsh, I beg you to keep this in mind.
2	DE9yyB19MfrDLPYuvr75GQ	Food was good but....... Service was horrible!! We received 1 basket of chips and then finally on the third time asking for more she told us they were out of chips. How do you run out of chips?!  And she let us order guacamole knowing there was no chips. Then it took 20 mins to get our check once we asked and we had to yell at her again. We are still waiting here another ten mins later wait for her to run out cards. Worse service I've ever had!!!!!
4	HIgdl6QNqhZyyfB4ZwZT8g	The Gyro's are pretty good here, but the one thing that I really love are the french fries!  Those fries taste like the type of fries that you have at one of those BBQ places.  They are nice and thick and have that crispy texture to them that really makes you want to ask for a side of Ranch dressing, but I wasn't daring enough to ask for ranch dressing at a Greek restaurant.
4	QuWc6j306ZndN1qPNTBVw	We wound up here after trying to go to the restaurant next door, which turned out to be closed until later in the evening.  The Pewter Rose turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  Although there was some nice outdoor seating (with a great view of the LYNX station - Whow! (that's my bobcat sound effect)), we opted to sit at the bar because the items on the bar menu were only available at the bar.  We ordered a couple drinks (at great happy hour prices) and got two items from the bar menu: portobello mushroom sliders and fingerling potato fries.   Both were really outstanding, and inexpensive.  The sliders, in particular, were fantastic.  It was awesome to have such a great vegetarian option on a bar menu.  We talked with the manager for a while (she was filling in as the bartender) and had a really nice time.  Great, airy interior as well.  Go check it out.
4	iXnrNti4psnv2hPhumIH1w	Love it! Unlike all the other Hawaiian BBQ shops around that just copy L&L, this is a true mom and pop kinda place.  Big menu, Big portions.  Friendly service.  Food is good and not very healthy but hey! it's island food! I do think most people get take out versus dining in though.  The Lau Lau is the size of a brick and so much katsu in one serving i can eat it for 3 meals.
2	2FNK18T85RAFMap4bY3KcA	This place has very tasty food and a good little atmosphere, as well as stocked with good beer.HOWEVER I think it is a little over priced for a hot dog and beer joint. Also it is lacking in proper seating. Could be a lot more enjoyable with more atmosphere. If you don't mind paying a little extra and finding your own place to eat, then by all means enjoy these delicious hot dogs and (overpriced) drinks.
4	iFIumfDjxAa73oIOiBDA	Not sure of the negative experiences here.  Ordered my pie on-line - said it would be ready in 17 minutes....I got there with 3 minutes remaining on the clock and out of the oven it came!  Fresh and piping hot.  It was soo good too.  They made it correctly and the price was as quoted on-line.  As far as customer service, there was a lady in front of me who I swear never ordered a pizza in her life nor had she heard of Pizza Hut bc she was asking all sorts of questions about crust, ingredients, cheese, etc.  Poor guy.  The other service gal could see this lady was going to be a while so she called me to the side, got my name, my order, then cashed me out and handed me my pizza.   :)
4	9deQuRIvRzU31T1e12C2w	It seems as though good sausage is a way to my heart...or so my doctor tells me. But enough about me, this is all about a fantastic Phoenix gem that I would have never known of had it not popped up on my Yelp app one Sunday afternoon; this is about Caffe Sarajevo.  This Bosnian dive is home to a seemingly authentic menu, and an atmosphere that made me feel like I left Phoenix for lunch. As with any ethnic dive, I expected service to be absolute crap or absolute gold...the service I got was gold! I walked in with the girlfriend into a small dining area filled with customers speaking words that I couldn't understand while laughing and having a great time enjoying their food and company. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit wherever we'd like by a server who was smiling and very welcoming. After we sat down, he came over and was awesome enough to go over most of the menu with us, explaining each of his favorite things in perfect detail. - If you know me, you know I like dives... Also, if you know me, you know I love asking for recommendations, and love hearing those recommendations with enthusiasm. -  I was in heaven, and completely excited when we decided on the Cevapi (the sausage sandwich), the Pljeskavica (a beef patty sandwich), a Sirnica (cheese puff pastry) and some freshly made Turkish coffee...  And here we go:  I love coffee, especially strong, rich coffee with real flavor. Lemme tell ya, if you're looking for some good caffeinated mud, look no further. Just great. While waiting for the main dishes, we shared the Sirnica, which had just come out of the oven! It was literally a hot mess and filo doughLICIOUS! As far as those sammiches, we didn't want to stop mowing through them! The Cevapi was served with a couple sauces and raw onion, and the sausage was a mix of lamp and cow. Mix those all together on some freshly baked Bosnian bread, and...Yum! The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread, but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef. It was also yum, especially since it was covered in cheese and mushrooms!!  Holy hell, I've gone on long enough. The food was great. The service was great. The people were all great. I'm such a fan. I love dive restaurants. I love ethnic food, and now, I love Bosnian food.
2	dM0pzADtOSCMBJzwgtRFg	One word of advice, avoid the chow mein. The beef not only tasted disgusting (very low quality), the noodles were overcooked and the entire dish had maybe 5 vegetables total. It was so unpalatable I ended up sending it back. The sushi here however, is pretty decent.
2	HhroA1KMwZAYBhoCXqN6g	bagels are pretty good considering there aren't any rel bagel shops out in the valley.  the service here is TERRIBLE!!  Can;t get orders right, can't get people moving in and out of the shop....I stopped coming to this place for a year and sad I came back the 2 times I did to try and give them another shot.  Even worse.
4	QYfMCU8SRMOSQ3USyZ4diw	So...considering the wife has now written her review I think that allows me to write mine :). Went here for a business lunch a few months ago and was leery of it for obvious reasons. Drove up to the place with my colleagues and the place was packed for lunch. Paid the $10 cover which was for the lunch and was seated at the table in the back of the room near the food. Food was great and what I had heard about it prior was backed up by the food I ate...one of the best buffets in town (food wise...ha). Service was spot on and non intrusive.  You'll see everything here. Women and men meeting for business. Guys in suits indulging in the "non-food buffet" and pretty ladies. Overall...great spot Charlotte, though I have nothing to compare it to in town. . For info on that I'll need to continue to read Jay R's reviews! ha.
2	XzPcNUmnFJWEDmfPc16zBw	The first few times I went there it was ok, good portions and decent service. I usually order the #3 ( have had it 3 times already) So I decided to bring a big group of friends to eat there to share in its awesomenss. Big mistake. Service was poor. The waitress never came to check on us after giving us our food and they completely screwed up my order. I even called ahead of time to make sure they could cook the #3 plate, they said yes. When it came out it was 1/3 the size it usually was, and didn't have any of the peppers or bacon that it's supposed to come with. It was literally a few pieces of potatos with 2 eggs on top for $9. Everyone else was not really impressed either.
2	KZd2tUteZ1usUlZbmKERw	We've been this Panda several times. We use the drive thru periodically and every time they claim that one of our items in not ready and we have to go around and wait upfront.  Today was another time when this happened. We were told our food would be ready in 8 minutes. We waited 15 minutes and then finally went inside ....  We found the employees freely serving the item we were waiting for .... And defending the fact that they basically forgot our order. Terrible service ... Drive to a panda somewhere else ... Just not this one.
2	krpBRZSqcdZRJ3v5XdBdg	The place was clean, the service was great, the food was nothing to woohoo about.  I have been there twice, the food is consistently the same bland and boring stuff.  The salsa is just a step above Pace picante, the beans are not good, and the rice was the same.  If you have never had 'good' Mexican food, then you will probably love this place.
2	iZOHQF1gUvHmbCffHTRcA	Not so great, especially when you consider that Pho Avina (which is fantastic) is just a couple miles away.  We started with spring rolls which were just fine, but the peanut sauce that came with them seemed watered down to me, which was strange.  I got Pho Dac Biet, which came out *very* quickly.  The broth of the pho was not nearly as flavorful as most other Vietnamese places.  Additionally, some of the pieces of beef in the pho tasted really old, like they had been sitting out for days - ugh.  As Charee M. mentioned, they use the wrong noodles in their pho, which I thought was pretty odd.  After we finished eating they brought out our check and...fortune cookies? At a Vietnamese place?  Weird.  Anyway, save yourself a mediocre meal and go down the street to Pho Avina which is MUCH better.
4	RCzuCOlcvnF1yn53CDDvw	My first time at a a Nepalese restaurant. Who knew you it would be in Wisconsin! A nice little restaurant on the main street, with friendly servers and great food!  The portions are on the small to medium size, so my only real complaint would be that they should give a little bit more food to even out with the not so cheap prices, or give the small (normal- keep it as is) size portions and lower the prices. Prices are more for a tableclothy mood light restaurant, This place is more of a sit down/take out style (although it is a restaurant not a dive) Other than that, the food was great!.    There are many vegan/veggy dishes to choose from as well as meat dishes.  My friends were very happy with what they chose, considering none of us have eaten this before. The way I would describe the cuisine would be a mix of Indian and Japanese/Chinese. The boys had the curry dishes, which reminded me of Chinese food curry or Caribbean curry. The girls had the vegan dishes, mine was amazing. I don't know what they put on my asparagus but it was seasoned to perfection. The dumpling appetizer (I forget the name of it) was pretty good as well. I was surprised when it came with a tomato sauce!   If your in Madison, check this place out.
4	BYXtW2AAt2YffrUHJ936g	Yum.  I love their gyros.  They sure do fill ya up.  This was my first Gyro experience years ago and I crave it all the time.  Not as authentic as other Greek places but for fast food it certainly is good!
4	jXH9YaRnCV5gVX8wVwKA	Rosati's is one of the better pizza options in the Valley. I've only had the thin crust, but it is excellent. The center is rarely underdone or droopy. They cut it into squares rather than pie slices, which is a minor annoyance.  Stay away from the pasta; it's wet, the marinara is obviously canned and quite runny, and it's overloaded with cheese. The garlic bread is ok, but it won't save one of their pasta dinners. But it's a pizza place, so I won't ding them for bad pasta. The salads are so-so; heavy on the iceberg lettuce but still fresh, so don't shy away if you want to combine a salad with a little pizza for a lighter dinner.  The atmosphere is inviting, with decorations reminiscent of Chicago without being overwhelming (I'm talking to you, Pizzeria Uno). The staff is decent, though they're often hidden in the kitchen or bar and not often at the tables.
4	gDkaxMdfxfEesQAX3VUWw	Be aware that when you order their signature Carne Asada Fries, you should be VERY hungry. Even though it's really good - lots of well-seasoned meat, guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese on top of a generous serving of fries - you will probably  not be able to finish it. The serving is that humongous; it can feed three people. This small eatery offers lots of combinations and items at low prices. Definitely no fancy atmosphere, but lots of choices and generous servings of good food at low prices make this place a winner,
2	pTeyAyOhq65opsicOcwMw	I was brought to this restaurant on May 30th with the promise that I'd have a ridiculously delicious burger.  It's a proposition I have never refused.  Perhaps, I should think twice in the future.  I ordered a AAA angus burger with a regular bun, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg as a topping.  The bun was OK... kind of fancy and toasted.  The patty was seriously weird.  It was a perfectly molded, thick circle of ground meat... only the meat seemed to have been extra grounded into a slurry and then compressed together.  It was completely and evenly cooked.  However, it was bereft of any juiciness and had absolutely no taste.  The only thing that saved the burger was the fried egg, which provided the flavor.  I paid over $10 for this sham of a burger, when I probably would have been better off getting a quarter pounder from McDonald's.  The decor is very modern and is about as nice as any bistro you'll find, and the waitresses are very friendly.  You wouldn't think it served fast food just by walking in.  Unfortunately, that's all this place has going for it.  Then again, if you like being pretentious without substance, this is the fake burger joint for you.
4	lvmCIJLQunUmp5lwlqe97g	Was visiting w/ my bf n his brother from CA and didn't to eat here w/ their bro n sister in law who recently moved to Henderson. It's like All You Can Eat within ONE Hour of ordering!! And make sure you finish it All cuz they'll charge you!! It was my first experience with sushi n thanks to this place I love it!! The five of us finished everything we ordered and were Stuffed!! Service was Great btw!! Very fast!!
2	1e9558kzp1bvMMnow4jQ	The steaks we had were good if a bit overpriced. I've had a better baked potato at Outback steakhouse (and yes, you can tell the difference between a baked potato and a boiled potato!). Our waiter was awful! He had no people skills and was almost rushing us through the meal ( really dude, its a Monday night, and half the place is empty). The saving graces for this place were: the caramel apple martini (absolute yumminess!, and the hostess (her name was Helen) who was very nice over the phone when I made reservations and when we got to the restaurant. She also spoke to us on our way out. She embodied customer service, which can sometimes be hard to find on the strip. Thank you Helen! I think I would have rather saved the $150 we shelled out on this place, and eaten elsewhere!
4	00lpdGZwyyzkfYwLpgPoGw	I know it seems strange to review a fast food joint, but hey, these guys need love, too. Today, I took my kids out to lunch at Jack in the Box at 7850 N 35th ave.   Even though I had several customizations that seemed to confuse the cashier, she approached me in the lobby before fulfilling my order to make sure she had gotten it right. All of our orders were completely accurate, and the place was pretty clean, for fast food.   The owner/manager was working in street clothes, which is usually a big red flag to me that the store is going under, but the employees seemed relaxed and determined. The area is hokey, and the patrons were a little smelly and dirty, but that is to be expected from this area of town, and certainly shouldn't be a problem if you have a hungry belly that needs filled.   No complaints, although Jack in the Box as a whole could bring their prices down. $30 for one adult and two children, considering I can get the same prices at sit-down places in the area.   All in all, not bad! Way to get it right, Jack in the Box.
2	4oKWgdXFGLDGj7eHy3jg	"Excuse me waiter. What's this fly doing in my soup?"  "It appears to be doing the backstroke sir."   Yep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh!   Formerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio "singing" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out!   The food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast.   Christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun!   So I can't say oui oui to MB quite yet. And for now I shall just say ta ta!

It is a bit pricey unless you go for lunch but one thing I can say is that it is worth it. The joojeh kabob (cornish hen) and the bargs (chicken and filet) are always very well marinated, tender, and never dry or tough. Each dish comes with a great helping of hot rice which I also love. The cucmber yogurt dip is a must. Love this place, worth the extra dollar if you want a great Persian treat for yourself.
4	80QRekWstu8CT6PLgOxXlQ	Looking for a great place to have a beer and watch a game off strip? This place hits all points, I went last year during football season looking for a brewery to watch the game.  I tried a good amount of the beers, all of them are great however I would like to see them kick it up a knotch and branch out more hops more malt. Food specials during the game all over the place, service was great.
2	smHsrCQGwPefsIq115aM7g	The breakfast pastries are purchased elsewhere and reheated (in a microwave right in front of you) or toasted in a small toaster. $6.50 for a dry old cinnamon roll and a bagel that was only toasted on the half that fit in the tiny toaster (it took 8 min to get it). This place is only in business because of the resort. If it had to stand on its own it would have been gone years ago.
4	x5nYqE4pKNa8e5gOuumafg	While I swore I'd never write up a fast food chain review, I have to give this location a nod, as it had no reviews, and frankly, it deserves the compliment.  Reason being?  I got very courteous, very polite, very efficient service.  The guy who was behind the drive-thru window this last Monday was as polite as he could be.  I don't know whether it was the result of a competent manager training program, or his momma simply raised him right, but I usually don't expect compliments when I get an average fast food burger.  Nice kid.  Plus, my order was completely 100% correct, and I simply have to make note of that.  While every experience down the road may not be as favorable or as agreeable as this one was,  you have to give credit where it's due.
2	WN53Lt088xCoIWAPVOKnJQ	Sun Asian Kitchen.. Mm Sounds good, like the name. What does this place have going for it? Location, that is if you live in South Phoenix.. Great happy hour specials on food and booze   - $3 for 6 fat crab puffs, can't go wrong! Unfortunately the food is only 1 step up from fast food, the decor is pretty cheesy and there are 3 TV's that they like to play at full volume on different channels.. And do you really want to watch Animal Planet's Gross out show while you are eating? Really? But if your in the mood and don't feel like driving far it is decent enough. the staff is so attentive and they speak really really really fast..
2	FZdw5yexXA4RWY4nXgEgpQ	Went here for lunch today it was the most awkward uncomfortable lunch I have had I walk in sat at the bar the ??? Owner gave me a cold hello and walked back into the kitchen then I sat there for 4/5 minutes when the waitperson showed up gave me a fairly friendly hello although the service deteriorated from there ????? I showered brushed my teeth comb my hair  i ordered the wings and asked if I could split the flavors she said it must be 50/50 ok I can deal with that .......she came back out to inform me they had NO WINGS AT ALL...........serious.....so I ordered there 5 dollar burger and asked for it medium and got it basically well done I'm not even sure it was the burg I ordered but I really just wanted to eat and leave at this point she never asked me how any thing was and when she took my check for 18 dollars with a 20 dollar bill she brought me my change and never said a thing .....like thank you or thanks for coming in or ...........ok here's one thing they had a good selection of beer on tap ...... Fat Willy's you are off my list of places to go
4	Iiw9ejZVemwLPIMLb3czA	This place has been around forever, I have lived in PHX all my life and yesterday was the first time I have eaten here.  My husband and our friend drove over yesterday. We were in the need of good food and beer and we got just that at the Wineburger.  I realize they are known for their burgers, but when I saw they had pork tenderloin on the menu I had to have it.   The boys ordered burgers and we split an order of onion scoops and fried zucchini. The onion scoops were awesome! They are fried onion petals and in the breading are bits of red pepper. After a while the onion scoops get a tad spicy, but they are tasty.  They have a decent selection of beer by the bottle, but if you get a pitcher you are limited to Molson or Coors.   The pork tenderloin sandwich was good, but a bit of a disappointment. My family is from the midwest and I know good tenderloin and the Wineburgers is just ok. They put cheese on it which was good, but kind of weird too because I'm used to my tenderloin with basic mustard and onion.  My husband and our friend said the burgers were tasty. Next time I'll have to try one.  On this particular day the service was pretty slow, but it was very friendly. I think they may have been a little under staffed and that is understandable.  The prices are pretty reasonable. For two burgers, one tenderloin, two appetizers and two pitchers of beer the total was less than $40. Not too bad because we left very full and a tad tipsy.  All in all I dig the Wineburger. It reminds me of a bar in the midwest. I felt totally comfortable here. Since I live pretty much within walking distance I will definitely be back.
4	LGlnYjMnIoi2Zxrlyi6NTg	Last week a friend said the Dirty Drummer has a Wednesday special; it's a hamburger with normal toppings for $2.50 that was good! I said no way a burger for $2.50 that's good? So we went as a group last night and had some burgers! Let me tell you that burger was good & tasty!  They are a good size and cooked to order and the toppings where fresh!  You can add cheese to it if you like, but that will cost you .75 cents, I had swiss, oh it was delish! Service was great, making sure our cups where filled and not lacking in anything. Also they have great drink specials too! I had a burger & 2 rums & cokes for $7.50! Where else can you get that?  Kinda left me wondering what the other days of the week's specials are?
4	mzRauKhViQrw7nnjjgBSw	Mmmm... Chuck Box... Droooool...  So this place looks kind of run down, some of the staff looks a little scary, and there's literally a 1" thick layer of grime on the brick next to the grill that's probably taken 40 years to build up, but damn is it a good burger. This is one of those places where they go out of their way to disgust you and you still come back because the food is so good.
2	bkz8NZGtBYQEdyJTrpw	I am eating it as I type this..  I am so unhappy with this pizza. 14 dollars, just wasted. Delivery guy had to call me to find me, because someone put the address in wrong. Took extra time.   Pizza cheese is so rubbery.. Just awful. Sauce is chunky.. Boring...   I feel bad that my friends, I invited at my party has to eat this...  next time Frozen pizza...   :(
2	w77i8ykHuLY4A0oJJL2Rg	I stopped here with a  neighbor yesterday around noon and I forgot the two rules of IHOP.  Rule #1:  Never get anything other than breakfast.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.  I almost ordered some pancakes but at the last minute I changed my mind and ordered their new turkey and bacon club sandwich.  It's not really a club and had I read the menu I would have seen that it was on a grilled roll.  Misnamed product I'd say.  The disappointing thing about the sandwich was that the turkey was sliced lunch meat, not sliced turkey.  It was an ungainly sandwich and the innards squeezed out as I ate it.  The redeeming part of lunch was the seasoned fries--seasoned mostly with salt, but then I'm a salt freak, so I thought they were great.  Service was OK.  After we got our lunchers, we realized the server forgot to give us napkins or silverware.  Unable to flag anyone down, we walked to another table and took theirs.  I haven't been to an IHOP in a couple of years, but if I return, I'll remember Rule #1 --- or #2.
2	MwTLlBdu2Kp1kUOyjCdQ	ok, here's the bottom line: the food is awesome and the cannolli's are the best i've ever had, but the SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! every time i have gone in the service has gotten worse and worse, they were so incredibly rude the last time i went in that i absolutely will never go back, their loss my daughter loved their pizza and we were getting it every other week along with a few cannolli's, but we are done, no more. u can't treat your customers like that, i don't care who you are, especially in times such as these you should be stepping up your customer service and not stepping on them.
2	LyArCpV66LgbkUtWmCrpw	Ce ne sont pas les restos Salvadorien qui manquent dans ce quartier et celui-ci sans \u00eatre d\u00e9cevant, est largement surrestim\u00e9 et ne se compare par \u00e0 El Chalateco sur Beaubien par exemple.
4	s9VkWAbkSTVqBOOpGuag	A Fast Food Favorite  Whataburger has been in the business of serving food for a very long time. You cant make it in the fast food industry for as long as Whatburger has by serving bad food.    The service at Whataburger is always fast, friendly, and accurate. My nephew and I ordered our food and went to a table, before I knew it our food was brought to the table. The food was fresh, hot, and oh so good.  The burger patties at Whatburger  aren't thick  but the lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mustard and bun really do make for a tasty burger.   I also enjoy Whatburger's breakfast items.  The Breakfast on a Bun with sausage and grilled onions is pretty good, as are the pancakes. Whatburger has  everything you want for breakfast at a reasonable cost !
2	TVfaLtO6q6u5uOiA2STrHA	So, I've only been to this Tempe San Felipe once and it was for a networking event.... all I met were really drunk people. Not sure if that is the networking groups fault or San Felipe's so I'll make this review not reflect that part.   My most fond memories of San Felipe are my fun college years at Northern AZ University, so once I walked into this Tempe location, I was disappointed--- it looked like a mega-mall bar, not like the San Felipe I remember.   The crowd was interesting, it had a mix of all ages-- young and old were out this night. Service was slow, but nice. It wasn't too busy but busy enough, it was just a little after 5pm, so the "happy"-ness was just getting started.   I might go again to this place, just see what the vibe is and when I am not there for a networking event. If I was in the neighborhood, but that doesn't happen that often so we'll see!
2	Rvx6coNzljIRh4ies35ukw	Ordered pizza and salad for takeout on the way home from work.  Pizza was very thin which I loved, but the cheese wasn't tasty and the veggies were just blah. The salads were gross.  The tomatoes looked like they had just been recovered from the dumpster.  Man, I miss good pizza in Las Vegas.  Where are you?!
2	HbwRlNIorYdb7OGoD3oIQ	Yeah, I had to check it out for the little ones. I went on a Saturday night around 6pm, which may have been my first mistake.  The place was sooo loud and insane, it was like Chucky Cheese, without the distraction of the arcade games for the kids. The line for the drink machine was ridiculous. There were 8 people in front of me! I tried the salad with the Italian dressing, which wasn't bad although a bit wilted. The pizza was a joke. I tried the Mac and Cheese, BBQ, Ham and cheese, and the pan cheese pizza. If I had to choose one it would be the Mac and Cheese that was almost decent. The pizza dough was flavorless and quite similar to cardboard. The bread sticks had to be my favorite thing, because they were the only thing that I could stand to eat more than one bite of.  I couldn't even bring myself to try the cinnamon rolls or brownies.  My Mother-in-law ordered the chicken wings...which I would like to refer to as Mistake #2. They were like microwaved frozen wings, completely soggy and disgusting. She ordered mild, yet they were drenched in a hot sauce that the kids thought were too spicy. I tried one and it was alot hotter than mild.   The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the service was actually commendable. The bus persons kept the place clean and swarmed the tables as soon as people left. The people making the pizza were also quick to put in special requests as well.   I think I'll stick with Chucky Cheese next time. At least there I can MAKE my own salad and the kids are preoccupied by arcade games.
4	Bh8ctB7x6ponpPq0inn1w	My bro recently moved to LV and has been lookin for some taco spots. Well on one of our little adventures we stumbled upon this place, and let me tell ya it was a good find! The tacos are great with everything on them! I had 1 carne asada taco, and one chorizo taco... mmmmm 2 thumbs up : )
2	jh0ojGp8R3JaWBnFOZxWA	The only excellent in this restaurants was the customer services. The restaurants need major makeover so plain and duck tape all over the places unless they are planning to do so. The food was not my favorite seem they can't keep up with standard. The onion rings was so terrible so oily ( not eatable ) eh mm BK make much better onion rings than what they served on us.  Grilled Salmon was so dry aka overcooked plus leave fresh strongly fishy smell.
4	I0NmCdxdWrTlIYVAxeO94Q	This place is pretty nice for bar food and a draft, and they always seem to have the right games on with HDTVs.  Their portions are ample and fairly priced.  The $11 top progression payout I saw on a slot made me laugh, though.
4	2hpXcFr8vXqpAF5SCPmV7A	Food was def on point! Got fried whiting, greens and mac and cheese! The greens and the fish stood out the most! Mac and cheese good but not great!! Greens were seasoned to perfection with a perfect hit of sweetness. Fish was rather thin in my opinion but seasoned pretty well....Their whiting is a joke compared to Mert's!!   Nevertheless food was good and I will definately be back when Im back in the area!!
2	UHGDikNvMck5LCOvoShUw	Looking for cheap sushi? You'll get it here, in terms of portions, quality, preparation... everything but price. This evidently is what happens when Koreans sell Japanese food prepared by Latinos with a total emphasis on cost-per-serving control. All in all, this is a must miss.
4	O8H8WRDaZCwDj7XAmhpKg	If a person can't feel at home at Harold's, there's no hope. GREAT atmosphere, good spot for people watching, Steeler Bar on Sundays...the Italian Stallion sandwich will blow your socks off. DON't miss this spot !!!!
4	SfWtbQeG5AoSF82cfbo9dA	This location is right around the corner from my house so been my go to location for panda for more than a few years now. Always friendly staff who offer samples right away. Sometimes if a dish is running low they will offer me the fresh one coming up instead of the old stuff that's been sitting there for awhile. Always good service.
4	cAOMkJSb4jq3LQ75ou0g	this used to be my favorite place to eat in the neighborhood. great atmosphere , very italian. never a wait even though it's always packed & popular.they start you off with some bread to dip in olive oil & cracked pepper. they serve all pasta dishes. my favorite was the twice-baked lasagna with marinara. best pasta i have ever had. then about 6 months ago i wen for lunch and they had changed the entire menu and taken the 2x baked lasagna off the menu. what a sad day. they have a lot of dishes with asiago cheese so remember if you don't like alot of it you better tell them they load on the cheese!! great dining experience very friendly staff & food is great just a very limited
2	JGT2bsJdtMZGdEj9SKuqQ	The two employees working the counter at the Mediterranean Gate hated us. And for that, we apologize.   After a 4-hour car ride to Edinburgh, over an hour driving around the city (thanks to construction) to find our hotel and another hour walking exploring and searching for a place to eat, we settled on take-out from Mediterranean Gate to bring back to the hotel.  So, needless to say, we were all (4 adults & a toddler) hungry & a bit cranky.  We didn't mean to be so chaotic and take forever to order, but they had 5 different menus around the store and none of us could figure out what sounded best.  In the end, my sister & I ordered a falafel wrap with baba ganoush, which apparently they were out of. Hmph. (Fine for me, as I was going to get it without anyway.) They gave my sister aubergine (eggplant) on hers - and guacamole. An interesting condiment in a Mediterranean place!  The chips (aka fries) were frozen - I saw the guy take them out of a bag and put them in the frier) - and needed more ketchup.  While HUMUNGOUS, the wraps themselves were not flavorful enough - even with hummous, tahini & hot sauce! We ended up all adding hummous that we had in the hotel to our wraps.  A huge thank you to the man sitting at the table - he helped us move our stroller out of the way and even helped us order! We have no idea if he worked there or was friends with the employees, but he was a huge help. And a huge sorry to the guy who walked in and tried to place an order in the middle of our chaos. You just had bad timing, dude.  Mediterranean Gate - you told us not to come back (were you joking?). Don't worry - we won't.
2	vubAeWRcuHEKMmZ6ZcMHw	We headed here for dinner the other night because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. For the food and service, it deserves 1 star. But since the space itself is nice and the happy hour deals are good, I'll bump it to 2 stars.  When we arrived, there was exactly one host / bartender / server - and he may have even been doing some cooking too. So needless to say, service was incredibly slow (despite there only being two other tables of people). And to make it worse, he reminded me of a used car salesman - extremely pushy about getting you to order certain dishes. The table next to us was a mom and young daughter. The mom declined dessert, but the server then proceeded to tell the little girl about the bananas foster crepes and that she must want those. It was all very uncomfortable. (And the same thing happened to us with the one special of the day that he described to us.)  The good thing here is the happy hour deals. When we went, all mojitos were 1/2 half and all seafood and meat tapas were 1/2 off. And that is a great deal. Unfortunately, the mojitos and tapas were downright awful.  We had a mango mojito and blood orange mojito. Neither of us could even stand to drink them. They were very obviously made with a powder mix - and you could see and taste the powder. Ick, icky, ick.  We ordered a a variety of tapas - the special of the day (red peppers with capers and feta), mac 'n' cheese with bacon, tortilla a la espanola, fried dates, etc. We were both incredibly hungry, but we didn't finish any of the dishes. Not only were they disappointing, they were just plain bad.  The mac 'n' cheese was dried out, had little to no flavor, and practically no bacon. The tortilla espanola was very dried out and way overcooked. These are two tapas that are standard favs of mine at any tapas place, but complete failures here.   We literally left the food half-eaten on the table and went to another restaurant in the same shopping center.
4	BGi1r5keRz8JPLSo9okyTQ	I went to Sardella's this afternoon to try their pie (with my fave topping, pepperoni). The restaurant has a cozy feel, the service was fast and friendly, and the pie was good; the cheese, sauce, and quality of the crust was better than what I get at most pizza chains. I'm glad, too, that they managed to keep their prices low.
2	tVD6U3edRLX9WcvnoqHqg	I used to love it here.  I don't know when they decided to downgrade their service, and quality, but it showssss.   This place has become the high priced, low quality dinner theater restaurant, in my eyes.  Don't get me wrong, I love their happy hour.  Half priced selected appetizers are now the only reason why I would stop here to eat.  My hubby and I came for dinner, and basically flushed $200 down the drain.  Everything was bland, and if it wasn't bland it was overly salty.  The wine list made us laugh because they had a $42 bottle of Pinot and then it jumped to $700 bottle of Pinot.  Nothing in between.  It was just bad.  Do yourself a favor and hit up their happy hour for the truffled mac and cheese.  It is the same portion, as if you would order it for a sit down dinner, and the slashed price feels better going down.
2	JTFH3PcbTPkLE9HJZWHfQ	I just now got back from a group lunch at Havana Cafe. Terrible Visit.  Unbelievably SLOW  service (a TWO HOUR lunch? Are you serious?) and the food wasn't that great. I was really disappointed. I have been DYING to try Havana Cafe for a few weeks now and finally got my lunch buddies to go.  We arrived at the restaurant at 12:09pm which I know for certain because I received a text at that time. We were seated and we ordered our drinks. By the time our drinks came everyone was ready to order their meal. We waited almost an hour before the bread basket was plopped on our table. We were expecting our meals shortly after. Our food was served to us over 1 hour after our arrival.   I ordered the San Juan Combination plate that came with a little of everything. How do I say this nicely? Um, I don't think I will be ordering that again. The Pastele was old and dry. Usually when you cut into a tamal or pastele, it doesn't crumble or break. Mine did. The mofongo seemed like it was sat to dry out. It came out in two mounds and both mounds were greasy and dry (is that possible? yes.) The alcapurrias were tasty and tangy. Still a little greasy for my taste, but they were ok. I mean you can't wring out deep fried food. The tostones were not good. Again, something that was left to dry out. They were neither crispy nor edible. They were fried all to hell and I couldn't eat them. I took one bite of them and sat them aside. They made a lovely garnish though. The arroz con gandules was the highlight of the plate. The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip. The masas de puerco fritas were greasy little chunks of pork that were ok once I dipped them in the mojo.   All of us were underwhelmed with our meals. Nothing spectacular nothing amazing, and everyone commented that things were cold, or greasy.  Next long wait, the check to be paid. We decided to split the check 6 ways. Easy right? Wrong. It took another 15 minutes to get that done. Just an FYI, parties of 6 or more get an automatic gratuity on their bill. The service was awful and I think 18% gratuity was very generous. We left at 2:08pm.  I don't know if I'm brave enough to give Havana Cafe a try again. I might go back to try their drinks. Usually a good amount of alcohol makes anything taste good so that might boost their rating up a bit.   I was really looking forward to Havana Cafe, but my friends and I agree that this place was disappointing.
4	DV9VW6BBrJXMHt2xsrbpQ	Uber innovative flavors a la mac and cheese, philly cheesesteak, etc.  Bonus: all flavors available by the slice so a group can choose a myriad and sample each others'.  However delectable the toppings the crust is nothing to complain about--crispy without being burnt.  There's another location on State Street as well.
2	Psz84ChUoJPCinBxSBJOw	i hate to give them a bad review because our waiter was so nice....but, my allegiance to the YELP community must persevere!   This was a crappy restaurant. But, it was walking distance from our apartment and my mother-in-law wanted something close. Arghhhh.  The drinks were warm (yes, I know I'm in Scotland....but, I'm from the US where we serve cold drinks) and the food was mediocre. Had the shrimp stir fry and it was pretty bland. The only good thing was the price and the nice waiter.   Don't waste your money. I lost my pounds so you don't have to.
4	ZSJvlwYBTkot3dTZe5wBJA	I went to La Tavola Italiana last night with a (very cute) date and we had a great time. The waitor was very friendly and liked to joke around, as well as pretended my jokes were funny which I appreciated since I was on a date haha. We started with an order of artichoke hearts and they were very good, the portion was easily enough for both of us to share. For an entree I went with the shrimp scampi and my date the pasta with meatballs, neither of us wanted the included salad and the waitor was more than happy to offer a substitution of italian wedding soup which may have been the best I have ever had, and I have spent half of my life working in and being a patron of my uncles Brooklyn Italian restaurant as well as plenty of family dinners. The shrimp scampi was not prepared how I would have expected, pretty much just sauteed with lemon and a hint of garlic and broccoli on the side and with tails on instead of the traditional preparation over a bed of pasta. I loved the place so it pains me to have to say it was just "ok". My dates pasta with meatballs was a large portion with two large meatballs and she loved it, however she has a gutter pallet so I decided to give it a taste for myself and it was excellent. She ate her fill and we still left with at least half of her entree to go.  All in all the place was excellent, the pricing was very fair, the staff very friendly, and the BYOB was the icing on the cake. I highly recommend La Tavola Italiana.
2	IYmJZdG9FJPBQsrkS02A	Seems like a fun place to drink and hang out.  The Spicy Thai wings were nice and big and the flavor was fantastic!  Shared a smoked pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good.  I think the service could have been a little better since there were only 2 tables of people eating.  Several at the bar that the bartender was taking care of.  I think it's over priced for what you get.  I think everything should have been $2-$4 less.  The happy hour special for domestic bottles is $3.25 and most places it's $2.  I would go back to check it out during happy hour, but probably not to eat.
4	wIcMIDxrZ5KoxJEjZcWQA	My husband and I went for breakfast this morning. Food was delicious and had a great price! Not very healthy but really good. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Never saw the bottom of my coffee. Definitely going back.
4	rHqhHys0acvIQG9DdYGiw	So I have completely been MIA lately! It makes me sad, and I realized that I haven't not been going to as many new places or seeing new sites without Yelp's guidance! So this is my return.  Old Town Tortilla Factory was a-ok in my books! I had the enchilada and it was truly delicious. It was almost tex-mex and not truly a "mexican" enchilda, but it was still tasty! The sauce had just the right amount of kick, the tortilla appetizer was delicious, and our server was friendly and gave us space. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's not TRULY mexican food...  The only thing I would change? It was cold and windy and the heater wasn't close enough to our table to really warm things up ... but if that's my only complaint it wasn't too shabby. :)
2	7BDpY8cOXLkXYfEbxTTVzg	In Short: Selection is average, the taste could be better.  Try the hot pot on the weekend, probably the best thing there.  The best thing about it is the spacious atmosphere, where you are not packed in like sardines.  The selection is about average to any other buffet.  You can find the typical chinese selections, some sushi, and dessert.  Only thing is that it's all oily and salty, flavor of the ingredients are lost in thick sauces.  It's fairly cheap so if you just want to stuff your stomach with random food, it's perfectly fine.  One thing that does set this place apart is the ho pot.  I think it's only available on the weekends but I maybe wrong.  They provide you with a burner and either spicy or mild flavored stew.  Then you can pick your veggies and meats, then have at it.
4	RpilH5l5zqmfY0Z2tQryQ	God help me, I really like this pizza. They don't have any of the fancy toppings I love, and they're a chain. I mean, this place is a favorite for children, children! But I cannot help myself. I love this pizza.   The wings, on the other hand, are abysmal. There is possibly nothing grosser than wings with gelatinous skin. Fry them! No person, ever, wants to eat chicken with slimy, pale chicken skin.
2	6XlyeJAjhjwJjCcQidiWZg	hmmm...  given the way this place looked from the outside, one would expect to be inundated w/ all types of food but alas you aren't!  the food is relagated to one corner of this huge room and the dessert selection was as big as the food selection (which is not necessarily a bad thing but more on that in a bit).  all the selections were average at best with the snow and king crab legs being the only redeeming qualities.  the prime rib was below average and the shrimp was eh.  some of the fruits looked more like they were out of a can than just cut fresh in the back.  the desserts tasted like they were all made from a duncan hines batter.  only the peach cobbler was alright but that was once again made from a peach in a can (i could make a reference to the song peaches by the presidents of the united states of america, but i won't...but i just did...oh well)
4	AlZdPs8WLIjLwi1OOpKRcw	Really more of a 3.5/5 in my opinion. Really great atmosphere in one of Madison's coolest neighborhoods. Sandwiches are pretty good, and most of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared which elevates this place above your typical sandwich shop. The Gazpacho was amazing as well. 5/5 on that front.  $10 for a cup of soup and a sandwich with a nantucket nectar seems reasonable to me. I'll enjoy this again on a lazy summer afternoon.
2	4ChY22gEgYculliZ2ftfA	I come here all the time and I wish I had never got out the car. The inside of this place is disgusting. Dirty. And always check your order because the last two times they forgot my tortillas and my dessert. I won't be back. And I plan on contacting corporate. Service was horrible.
2	xFMC3GB7Evk1FBjQqpJGvA	It will fill you up and it's a good price to pay for food ... but it's really only ok and if you're going to be in Vegas, don't waste your stomach space on this. There are MUCH BETTER places to eat at, guaranteed.
4	pyRZ5zQSUffvzccoztiPXg	This place is seriously the best place to go for boba. the boba pearls are always fresh and warm, and the prices are cheaper compared to other places. You can find this place right inside the chinatown mall. The place  is fairly small, from what I remember there are only two sets of tables. But it doesn't seem like people hang around there so there is almost always a table to sit around at. Heck, if not just go browse around in the other stores! Sitting's overrated anyway. xDD
2	YqTc73zlX2jakBtLAF92Xg	I was really excited to hear about this place but when I went there I was disappointed. I was hoping for a really nice tea room or a cute little boho place. This was neither. It was hard surfaces and dank. I looked at the selection and didn't see anything that excited me- I have an really good selection at home. So...I went home and brewed myself a cup for a LOT less money.
4	dG4cnvAKErLTcsIkHZwQ	One of my favorite spots on the northside for yummy and inexpensive food.  I really love the sandwiches that are toasted making the bread nice and crunchy.  I also really enjoy the thin crust pizza especially when I get the pepperoni and meatball toppings.  YUM.
4	SIoxwGeucu0BiHGR3iLw	This place is pretty good. I've never had a bad meal until tonight. $17 for a less than edible prime rib. The slab of meat was gristly and got very cold very fast. The best part of the meal was the cream of mushroom and meatball soup. If I had known the meat was mediocre I would have just had a few cups of that wonderful soup
2	RTJKmhZEqZQwmM7NCPqng	We were in town for the Art and Wine Festival and needed some lunch.  Lousy, fairly expensive food, but pretty good service.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich for $10.95, the pork had too much sauce and it was too sweet.  The bun is just a plain raw bun, not toasted or anything.  Fries and onion rings are fine.  We also tried the burger (also $11) and the sliders.  Lousy burger, it's grey, tasteless cadaver-meat.  Think school cafeteria burger only thicker.  Again, no toasted bun, not ketchup/mustard/mayo.  Just a plain, bland $11 burger.  Someone in our group tried the taco salad and enjoyed it.  Our waitress was nice and kindy offered to let us take our remaining drinks to-go.
4	BDxxQ18QAnzsI7NEXOaQ	Great Karaoke 7-days a week right in old-town Scottsdale. Thousands of songs available, and a great place to go with a group of intoxicated friends. This is my favorite karaoke place in town - It can be hit or miss (crowd wise) during the week, but I have had several memorable weeknights here.  Decent food on the patio upstairs, and another bar to get you ready to perform downstairs.  *Note: very, very, very busy on the weekends after 9pm! IF you want to sing a lot go during the week...
2	OtIoLmvWI7bGA5vWMPkRxg	I read about the fries on sandwich and wanted to try it.  I got the Fat F sandwich with cheesesteak, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks.  All sandwiches come with mayo, ketchup, and fries.  One bite and it was over.  It's so hard to swallow that first bite and then get it down.  But it's pretty good as well.  The salty flavors of the chicken fingers and cheese sticks draws you back for more.  I could only finish half the sandwich before I was defeated, knocked down by grease, salt, and that chewy dough texture that makes you want to chew and chew.  I probably wouldn't come here again on better judgment, but I might just one last time.
2	XTmb15on60EanELSwiO7g	Mucho Crapo By The Rue  The only reason this gets two stars, Is becuase of the patio and the bar,  Also because it isn't too far, I've even had them double charge my card.   They charge to much for a brew,  The food is mediocre at best if only I knew, I would have hit a Del Taco drive through, Not even worth going to look for someone to screw.  The tacos were tiny and at six bucks, I could have gotten a Double Del Delux, You're just a trendy name for the college f**ks, When ASU is playing Oregon you route for the ducks.  I really doubt I'll come in here again, Not with an enemy or even a friend, It seems that your greed has no end, I don't care if it's $2 you call it's starting at ten.   Uno Crappo!
2	5cZFHKUPthuBexRhuBPPiQ	**Graphic TMI Alert**  OK, so basically this is a Chipotle type restaurant.  If you aren't familiar with Chipotle, where have you been for the past ten years because it is the greatest place on Earth?!  Burritos/tacos/taco salads.  S.R. is basically the same besides the fact that the food is much worse.  Bad guacamole, bad queso, and gross meats.  The only good things about this place were that it was clean, relatively cheap, and you don't have fiery "aftermath"  (Think about that one).   Honestly, I will pay the "Montezuma's Revenge" price for the deliciousness of Chipotle rather than going back here again.    All that being said, I still ate my whole burrito and chips & guac.  It was only good because I was starving.  All I'm saying is... Use your cool new smart phone device thingy and type in C-H-I-P-O-T-L-E and drive to that dot instead.  Trust me!   Enjoy :)  -Ian M.
2	38el7luGrBdwnslBqoGBRw	Got my order wrong. When we went inside to get it, it smelled like stinky feet. The stench didnt go away the whole time we were there waiting for them to remake the pizza. If i had had to eat there, i coulda lost wt cuz i woulda lost my appetite from that smell. So, we waited 15 more minutes, again...while they made it a 3rd time. The manager came out and explained that there were 5 new ppl being trained, and they had made it wrong again the 2nd time. She and the cashier apologized up and down--even offered to comp our meal, which we had already paid for, or get a credit for next time, or a bottle of pop. I chose the pop. I would have only given it 1 star if the manager and cashier hadn't been so apologetic. But, they did waste almost an hour of my evening waiting in line to get my food, then waiting while they tried to figure out what to do, then waiting for them to remake it twice.
2	Ip3CrUvwSvSbNY7YiLrA	I use to go there often with my parents when I was a kid...early 80 and I use to love it. Unfortunately for them since that time I have been to many more restaurant and I now know better. The service was slow and I am not sure why because the place was fairly empty. The meat sauce for the pasta taste like can sauce. The pizza dough didn't look or taste like it was fully cooked and the dessert was nothing impressive.  They really need a blast to 2014 and fast o be able to stay open another 50 years
4	0s4dzZdGmkSoYvLpDRuA	Haven't eaten here in 10 years, but the food still tastes the same. Very good. The War Won Ton Soup is fantastic,  lots of won tons, shrimp, chicken and veggies.   Wish they had a Chinese restaurant  in a Morenci like this.  I gave it 4 stars because the containers looked to be smaller that I remember.  Must be a business decision.
2	x60hmd6ctTRruKk5rQRjSQ	What is the big deal about Roberto's? I just don't get it. Perhaps I need to venture further into the menu and start sampling something other than the tacos and nachos? The food is ok, but I don't find it particularly flavorful or yummy. In fact, I typically wind up throwing most of it away (no matter how hungry and/or drunk I might be). I do appreciate, though, that this location is open 24 hours a day.
4	8piZWZza4k8Pl3xQmM2sQQ	Now that they got rid of the horrible bartender who ignored women patrons thinking serving guys first would get her better tips. ., I am a fan of this place again.    Andi is a superstar bartender/ server and is worth more than what I can afford to tip her. She greets me with a smile, knows my name, knows what I want before I tell her, and best of all she knows if I am up singing, when she goes out to the patio, she won't pull my beer or half smoked smoke.   Most of the patrons are easy going and there is fun Karaoke by brad on Wednesdays, Fridays & Saturdays.  Good selection of songs and Brad is fair in the rotation.  As a finalist in the last competition I can say it was one of the fairest competitions I have been in .   It's not upscale, but the wings are good, the staff is nice, and there is ample parking in the lot - 3.50 for a mini pitcher of Bud light?  I'll take it :-)
2	HSY76wBrRTa53V3FAQDqaw	The two stars are for the food, as Service was worst.  There was one nice waitress with curly dark hair but sadly she was not ours.  Our guy kept bumping into my chair every time he went by.  And the maitre d':  some people cannot find their way out of a shoe box.  She was one of those people.  If the service was any slower, they'd go backwards in time (I'd go to restaurant that could do that).  Food was very average, but not bad.  Unrefined.  Don't go!
4	emPPkRndGmHxUm1NgmSEw	I always eat here... A good selection of sushi and the price is right. The all-u-can-eat is $25.95 for dinner for 60 minutes.... my favorite roll on the menu is the Volcano roll, it's heated up with a special mayo sauce on top.
4	3K7SwTNotBbZdfpWtkA	I never was a big fan of this chain, but found myself pleasantly surprised with this one. The signs on the window for a really big fish fillet was the lure..  Their fish sandwich is spectacular. Large, hot and succulent. They will see me again....
2	iK4pRvOxudj7a6WvA5AlLg	Bubble tease is one of those things you just have to try.  It's exceedingly popular amongst students here. And for good reason.  The places' atmosphere is thrifty, with random furniture. It has somewhat of a hippie-feel to it. But somehow it works.  Bubble Tease has a very high novelty factor, and is definitely fun to chill out for a bit with some friends.
2	WMoxa452KdJEMj7MevD5Q	We come here quite often on saturday mornings. The food is good and the servers are always friendly and fast. My only real complaint is there is always 10 families/couples waiting for a table and there are 20 open tables..... its the weekend,  plan on having a few more servers working so customers don't have to wait.
4	RThLB2zpp3UrWJW2SyE8rg	I always get the chicken tikka masala and it's always delicious.  The staff is pleasant and I haven't had a bad experience.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge.
2	m4UGe9eP9KHW0fZHptKWA	I attended a birthday party of 24 people that seated our group in 3 tables of 8. My dining experience went as follows.  Pros :  - I went with their "Veal Parmesan" with a side penne (they didn't have rigatoni..?) with a rose sauce.The "Veal Parmesan" was good with the meat tasting alright (it may have been a bit overcooked though ) but plenty of Parmesan.   - At first the service was very accommodating, at least for the first 30 minutes or so then it all went downhill as the resto got busy.  - Ordered a soda, it came in a bottle. I always find this a plus when soda come in bottles. I'm OK with cans but don't serve me fountain soda unless I'm at a food court.  Cons :  - The service completely dropped off the charts after 30 minutes. They seemed completely overwhelmed.  Tables weren't getting food at the same time. I understand we were 24 but they took orders by the table... why not serve a table at the same time then? It's very awkward getting your plate and your significant other getting theirs nearly 10 minutes later when you almost finished your plate. I find this unprofessional and unacceptable! Everyone at a table should be getting food around the same time. We also shouldn't be waiting for an hour for our food. Hire more staff and find ways to get meals out faster and more efficiently (without forsaking quality) to fix that issue.  - The pasta in my plate didn't feel very fresh and the rose sauce had too much liquid and too little flavor. Was this made in house?  I'd would rather have went with something else but for a place that claims to be Italian, some effort in their pasta is necessary to convince this Italian. Sorry!  - A meal for two will set you back about $100. Basically, it's about $50 for both plates, $10 for drinks and another $25 for dessert/coffee. Add tip and taxes and there's the bill. I find this quite expensive for mediocre food. I feel that they should go with a table d'hote instead which consists of an entree (soup or salad), a main then a coffee with a select menu of dessert of your choice. There can be extras here and there. I'm alright with paying about $25-30 per person. $50 though? No thanks.  - Ordered a cappuccino, it arrived cold?! This means the 30 minutes I waited for dessert my coffee, it was probably sitting on a counter somewhere for about 20 minutes. No. Noooo.  - Creme Brulee should be served hot or room temperature. Serving it cold is so anticlimatic for such a delicate dessert.  I think next time I'll just opt out to coming here and just send my friend a birthday gift instead. Lol
2	p9lMb6Omw79rZwjV5aYLRA	Like other reviewers, I tried this place out because it is conveniently located close to home.   Ordered the take out, off of the dinner menu. The one that includes a spring roll and a wonton. Didn't realize that neither of those were included in my bag when I reached home. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was decent, but it is difficult to mess up. The pork fried rice was interesting- seemed a little over cooked to me but it tasted decent.   I might go again in the far future, but I'll definitely make sure to check my bag before I leave the restaurant.
4	x8ZrUwyH2DxXPobnGkgJ0A	Your basic run of the mill Arby's nothing really stood out for me. The service was good, the food was hot and delicious. I wasn't disappointed, just wasn't wow'd by any aspect.   Pros: Close to my home, good service, food was hot and fresh.   can't say anything for the interior of the restaurant as I went through the drive through.  NOTE: They are giving 15% off military discount for an undetermined amount of time
4	2aMfhDplIH3b1t6PEF7twg	As a girl who was raised in Arkansas, I do, from time to time, get a hankerin' for fried chicken. I didn't feel like going to the store, washing dishes, etc, so I headed to this KFC.  KFC has changed a lot since I was a kid. It seems a lot cleaner. And I certainly don't recall not one, not two, but three cameras at the registers. But that's the world we live in, I guess.   Regardless, this particular location is extremely clean, the employees seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and the food is made pretty quickly. In fact, last night, Vanessa actually special-ordered some chicken tenders to be made a la original recipe, instead of crispy, which is the only way listed on the menu. How nice!  The sides now come in reusable containers. So reuse them! There's no sense in putting more trash in our landfills if you can reuse them...for food, crafts, cannabis...whatever.  Side note: in Cabot, Arkansas, KFC has a buffet. And a chicken liver meal. The buffet, I could do without, but I could dig some liver every once in awhile. Hint hint.
4	cVIG0tLKp06YYh9EsWVO4Q	Spur of the moment, close to home chinese. Thanks fellow yelpers! Tucked into the corner of a shopping center with two small rooms but ample seating for sure. Friendly staff and good food! We started out with an order of hot and sour soup, and order of pot stickers and then I had the Gang Pang chicken, my girl the orange beef. All I can say is the food was really good! Both these dishes seemed alittle extra sweet... I didnt read the menu completely or just didnt remember how my chicken was prepared. Normally I wouldn't order something like this but I did eat it all. There was a party in the other room but we were not bothered in anyway. The bartender was HALARIOUS with a few comments that were directed towards the Suns game! Nothing inappropriate just funny. The staff all seemed to get along great and helped each other. The drink refills were almost too much! LOL!! They were right on it with your water and tea. The only thing that was a bummer was the food was out bam-bam-bam!!! I like to finish my app before my soup comes out and same for my entree.... BUT.... That wont stop me from going back when I need a spot close to home and cant make it out to see my buddy Mr.Wong!!!!!
4	GMmGDasyE6o1RnaLVT9rEg	Not a bad place. Small, quiet, good atmosphere. The food is reasonably priced and the pizza is better-than-average.  My wife and I like to go here once in a blue moon because we used to live in the apartments right down the street from it. Plus there is a 2-for-1 coupon in the Entertainment book that makes it a great way to try it out.  Service was pretty good too. Never had to ask for a refill.
2	m2OAvw2EcEhwfotGQHyxDQ	OK so for drinks only, this place is your usual bar in a touristy part of town.  For eating, the food is pretty weak.  I had wings, and one of their speciality sandwiches which were both terrible.  Service was fine though so I don't blame the servers.  But this place is much better just for drinking.  The best thing about the place that gets it it's second star is the photo booth which is great since it's a true film photo booth (not digital prints).
2	mkx56dKu3O7V6dKOXAcJpw	I was kind of disappointed the first time I went with some friends for a quick lunch.  I ordered a veggie wrap and it was not very good, no flavor.  The beer was ok.  I decided to try it one more time as I live close by but again was not pleased.  The service was not so hot, the beer, ok again, we ordered pizza and it was mediocre.  We will not return.  I'll probably continue to driver over to BJ's at Chandler Fashion for consistently yummy food, great beer and pleasant service.
4	7Ygg4uUVpiuFzGo2VyiGNA	Used to be a regular for years, recently revisited after a 5 year absence. Glad to report that nothing had changed. The food is still outstanding, good old southern cooking, large portions, accompanied by good service and a large helping of Southern Hospitality, all at a reasonable price. If you want big screen tv's and sports bar atmosphere then go to Appleby's. if you want good food at a reasonable price then this is your place.
4	9kXc84Kp6xy5ACkYh0dURw	Echoing the last review...it's good! it's cheap! My $4.50 Mediterranean Sandwich wasn't perfect, but it was tasty, fresh, and large.   The small mug for water is a touch annoying, and I always feel like a bull in a china shop trying to get through their tiny space.  Overall, an excellent place for lunch, especially if one likes hummus! Great hummus.
2	JPDa4rDDMwK6VZiiapNeA	While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.  But these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.  I can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.  The biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.  In the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) "meat in tube form" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.
2	nsrfcVzWg50ibNOEpiMw	I was not at all thrilled with the food here. I found there to be a lack of choices for my tastes, but it may also be me being new to Greek food.  The food was kind of bland, but it was prepared fast and the staff was nice.
4	gfpeTDSgIghiSII55z1I6A	Upon arrival, I was surprised by the smell of cigarette smoke. That faded quickly into the background just as it did a few years ago when that was the smell of every bar.  My first impression was, "Let's get out of here," but then I started having a lot if fun. I played pool and had a cheap drink. A leather-vested man put down quarters to play the winner, so we stayed longer. The bartender asked us what we wanted to watch and said  that it must be sports related, so we watched hockey.  If I lived closer, I would come back more often because it was laid back, comfortable, and everyone was nice.
2	lvTM6L1hpsyt5HyvMhh6Q	Unfortunately my chicken sandwich was not crackin. Bread was hard & burnt, chicken was burnt and dry like jerky. Maybe the food is better when it's not New Year's Day. The fried zucchini were cool. Staff was nice but it would have been nice to also have a sandwich while the BF enjoyed his western bacon.
4	NuZsOg0Ra8Pu2XyWWxQprg	At first I was suspicious if all the yelp ratings were right since the place was empty but I went in anyway. I didn't regret my choice at all because already the appetizer I had was delicious. Plenty of parking. Friendly staff. All in all worth the trip.
4	Z3N54RTvmSyINIXb725NhQ	I love pei wei. I eat at one of the locations around the valley at least once a week. They have the best Orange Chicken ever. The Crab Puffs are great and if you like something spicy then get the Blazzin Noodles or the Thi Dynamite. The Lo Mein Bowl is delicious as well. I would rather go here than many other asian restaurants in town really.  All dishes can be prepaired with chicken, beef, or shrimp then choose white rice, brown , or you can get fried rice. I have been here many times and never had a bad meal. The prices are great and the amount of food you get is good. They have a few apps including lettuce wraps, edamame, crab puffs, dumplings and other great things.  They also serve bottled beer.
4	JzTko4EF9oHdBdZDAgwwtA	Fuel and Fuddle has my favorite wings of all time. I love the hottest ones! I eat lots of spicy food, and these are the only that are both tasty and spicy. Great beer selection. I love the alligator stew and waffle fries, especially.   Only problems with F&F is how crowded it gets, how loud it gets, and that it's in Pittsburgh!
4	R1DTCd9Tt3e18ttzSRutOg	Caramba's is a great spot to get some tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price. I love that they make everything fresh and use all white meat chicken. I think the food here is better than most Mexican restaurants in town. My only complaint is that the free chips always taste stale but I always eat them anyways!
2	sptaJFiMyLo0dpiZWLnTWQ	The Skinny: there's a reason why it's a pub - when you drink enough, the food has got to taste better (2), service - cute little Britney Spear-esque school girl outfits does not constitute good service unless - well, you're some place else (2), value - there's no value on bad food.  To sum up our experience: when we got into the car, the first thing my husband said was "do you think I'll get sick from the chicken pot pie?"  We headed here looking for a slice of British fare, ordering fish and chips, chicken/leek pie, and a side salad.  To start, the chicken pot pie was absymal. Albeit the pastry was a nice flaky crust, the filling was sour and unpleasant. I have no idea why it was sour. Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.  The fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce. The chips were not crispy on the outside and were bleh.  The side salad was okay but the house vinegar/oil dressing had chunks of dried rosemary in it which made it unappetizing.  Finally, our waitress. We had to wave her several times to refill our drinks and she gave us the wrong check. I think she switched our check with the table next to us which is a bit mistake on her part (their check was 3x more than ours). I felt bad for her at the end of the day.  As someone who appreciates beer and British culture, I could see this place being fun to check out a football game or some great brews. As a person who is just coming for the food, I would suggest you spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere.
4	OWwxI9h98wynZJlEc9ow	I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home.
2	aMXeNrM3IHzx5OYB8uCcig	I HATE to give Sonic a bad review because I love Sonic but this one is a dud.  I have stopped by for Happy Hour (half priced drinks from 2 to 4) several times and I don't think they have ever gotten my order correct. To top it off, the wait is eternal!  Forget the pull in stalls, you will run out of gas before you get your drink. The drive thru is slightly better. Fifteen minutes for a drink order is not uncommon and that is insane!  I have only ordered food on one trip, which was an easy order of apple slices and they were completely rotten/spoiled. I went and knocked on the door to get them replaced and he looked and they were all rotten and majorly out of date. Scary.     I will say, the staff I have encountered are friendly and always apologetic but they seriously need a fire lit under their pants.   Where I am from, Sonic is very popular and successful with lots of traffic regardless of the time of day - even though there is a Sonic on pretty much every corner. The Sonics in the Charlotte area do not compare. It's really sad because Sonic is a great place when run well.
4	nV5RjbrGBATIcIU2RiDWQ	Its the Paradise, okay?  That's all.  Have a drink, bring your friend, yeah, the one you still have.  You'll be fine.  My ex-ex bf and I stopped in here once years ago, blitzed from a pitcher at 5 other bars...we kissed sitting at the bar, no one flinched...yes, its that kinda place...you'll laugh, you'll cry...and no one will wonder why...
4	e0PIvIuIe53MTDcyqP8r4A	The service was fast, attentive, & courteous. The pancakes were to die for. If you want a good, filling bfast/brunch at an affordable price...highly recommend trying this place out. From the outside it's not super impressive to look at but inside is clean. And the service....I don't think my soda NEVER hit the 1/2 way mark. I was so stuffed on good food...u think I had to be rolled all the way home.
4	SuBSNQ6jhl624rbysCeoA	You should only eat at Defalco's if you have a lot of time on your hands. The line to order your food is really looooooooong and the wait to get your food after you order borderlines on absurd.   Other than that, and if you have an extra 8 hours on hand, this place is pretty good. The cashier is friendly, the food is fresh and  tastes above average and the portions are big, but not so big it is offensive (Cafe Delux I'm talking to you). Also they have lot's of good drinks like Diet. Dr. Pepper in the fountain or Dr. Brown's soda in the bottle.   Some dishes I tried and liked include: Chicken cutlet sandwich, Chicken parm dinner and sandwich, chef salad, chicken pesto sandwich, turkey sandwich, blt, tuna salad, baked ziti, all the soup - oh - and the mozerella caprese sandwich is the best thing on the menu.   Okay, I'm giving it one more star. I was going to give it 3 but I guess it deserves 4.
4	HcW3RBgGB0wFR2Y6wOoEIA	This place originated in Colorado, & it really shows on the inside with its lodge type atmosphere. The lodge setting gives this place a feel unlike any other Charlotte restaurant I've been to as it's an open area with wood decor throughout. It's a stand along restaurant in a shopping center & a really nice treat if you don't mind spending the money.  I went here for lunch with work one day & I would definitely recommend this as a dinner/date night place if I were the one paying. But the food is worth the price you pay. Their menu selection is full of red meat, but also has enough other options for everyone. Portion sizes are huge, so bring your appetite along with your wallet.  The portions are huge, the food is great, the atmosphere is intriguing, & the check is big. I recommend Firebirds as a date night place where you don't mind getting your fingers & face a little dirty from their huge portions.
2	L4HpB6qIzA8ldnKp7AIXcQ	Seriously, you would think a bar with a cool beachy theme and a nice patio would be a no brainer in Arizona. Sadly, this place has disappointed me. I have been here twice and I'm still unimpressed. Drinks are ok, but I would expect a little more alcohol in my drink- my vodka tonic tasted mostly like tonic. Also, I think I'm generally on the younger side of the crowd here, and I felt slightly out of place. Not trying to offend, and I know its in chandler, but one Saturday night I went, and I swear the average age was 35-40. Its ok for happy hour, but there are certainly better places to go.
2	fa9v4EBnZIBYOBRxezueg	This place only gets 2 stars because their sushi was decent. else everything else was a bit disappointing.... I went there for dinner last night with a friend because we had been dying to try out their food since last year but never had the chance to.  We went around 7pmish and it was pretty quiet inside. The restaurant was only half full and most of the patrons were much older than us (we are college students!)  We ordered the Tiffany Roll and Rock and Roll which are two of the 15 specialty rolls they offer and for entr\u00e9e we ordered the Kiew Wan curry (Thai green curry) and chicken pad thai.   After what felt like an eternity our food was finally brought to us. It was a bit annoying considering the fact that the restaurant was no where close to being full and I would hate to imagine what service would be like on a day that the restaurant was busier!  following the sushi our entree's arrived. This is where the meal took a turn for the worse. The curry was really watery and lacked flavor while the pad thai was THE WORST i have ever tasted in my life. I have tried Pad thai at a good deal of the thai/asian-fusion restaurants around the squirrel hill/oakland area and this pad thai hands down wins the award for being flavorless and disgusting. I even asked the waitress for some extra sauce of any kind to try and salvage the dish but the combinations of some random chili oil thing + siracha red rooster sauce couldn't do anything to save this helpless dish.   My friend and i both agreed that if we were to ever come again (highly doubt it) we would stay far far far away from the entree stuff and stick with their specialty rolls.  seriously though, STAY AWAY FROM THE PAD THAI! if you are craving some go to Silk Elephant or Bangkok Balcony in Squirrel HIll or Typhoon which is in the same neighborhood as Plum.
2	IyiBr7qB1cMSigThUSdA	I found this place by accident, walking past it last week while a guy stood out front in a suit and told me everything I didn't want to know about it. So ventured back there this week, and there he was, still trying to pull them in. Waited WAY too long to finally order. Kind of had to wave my arms to get some attention. The bread isn't bad at all. The minestrone was mostly vegetable soup. Also not bad, but not what I've come to expect from minestrone.  The spaghetti Napolitano was a bit greasy, and the sauce was very thick. Overall it was not a wonderful meal. The waitstaff were very nice, once I'd gotten their attention. I really wanted to like this place, but eh. I might swing by on the next trip and try the pizza I've heard so much about. But there are a LOTTA choices in the area.
4	N9hpnKEqymwyum7xmQGw	The Diamond Lives!  [Re]Opened Friday Ate on Saturday Delicious Big Block Burger Crispy Fried Pickles (w/o the side of fry oil you used to get) Gravy fries!  Thank you. I don't really care if they cater to picky vegans or not. Welcome back, old friend!
2	go46wVceAk4axScOOhTTyg	Really good barbecue, really spotty service.  I think the Famous Dave's franchise is a wonderful success story of stick-to-it-ive-ness and the American Entreprenurial Spirit. Dave Anderson's story is very compelling. I just wish everyone at this particular restaurant were as jazzed about Dave as I am.  The menu is fairly priced for lunch and dinner. I usually get a two-meat combo (catfish and brisket) with a side of firecracker green beans, and it comes with a half ear of corn on the cob, a cornbread muffin, and a half a slice of texas toast. There's like six flavors of barbecue sauce on the table. It comes to around twelve bucks with iced tea.  What I don't like about this Famous Dave's is the service. It's hit or miss...mostly miss. How some waiters keep their jobs is beyond me. I guess the manager is a very tolerant person or whatever. Today, I sat down with a few others for lunch, saw our waiter a total of three times: to take our order, to deliver our drinks AND food at the same time, and to bring the check...in about a whole hour! Ugh.  I love the food, that's the only reason this review gets two stars.  Beware of the so-called "Happy Hour" from 2pm to 6pm weekdays. Three Bucks (!!) for a 23-ounce Budweiser. That is really disappointing to me. We're not talking about Imported German Beer, we're talking Bud on Tap! Incredible.
2	Xv9Et18zntQ104WxluHA	After trying on wedding gowns next door, my group was in the mood for Mexican food.. UGH! NOOO! Ive got a gown to fit in to! I love the decor.. The staff was friendly.. The food.. was, so so.. I found the chips on the greasy.. as in.. greasy fingers side.. The salsa was great.. and my enchiladas were nothing amazing.. almost watery.. I dont think its nice to have to ask for app plates for my chips and salsa.. but we had to, because I thot it was ridiculous to be using napkins!  Our waiter seemed off kilter when asked to split the check.. oh well.. so so.. is a 2 too..
4	O1RU40LTpXZbso6ICPCRgA	This place is a Korean run restaurant.  Don't know why they decided to call it China Wing.  Only if you look at the sign do you realize it's a Chinese/Korean restaurant.    The food here isn't spectacular, but it is still decent Korean food.  They have a $4.95 lunch special, but that only applies to Chinese food.  The nice part is, they serve the elusive Korean-Chinese fare, that you can't find at Korean or Chinese only restaurants.  JJa jang myun, ggampoongi, omul rice, tangsuyok to name a few.  The prices are a tad high, but it's still worth a visit.
4	IhojBsq0VbVdQynoupOA	These subs are great! Cut fresh and made to order every time. This is very similar to Jersey Mikes int hat that cut the meat fresh right in front of you. Almost 50 different types of sandwiches available to choose from. Staff is always friendly and are gracious for the business. Even if a Subway or Quizino's was in the area, this would still be my choice. About 15 tables available to sit in and they also over large subs for catering! It's even open on Sunday's from 11am-4pm, which is great, as it's hard to find a sandwich place on Sunday's open.
4	YGV82Eb2HBKSWfq11J96Q	VERY tasty food but not cheap.  I went here for lunch with coworkers and since I don't eat flour/wheat I ordered a chicken/kafta plate with rice, salad and garlic sauce.  The service was slow as there was only one waitress and what appeared to be the owner working, but the service was friendly and very accommodating.  The chicken and kafta was honestly some of the best I have ever experienced.  Chicken was moist, well marinated/seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The kafta was perfectly seasoned, char grilled, and not greasy like I have experienced elsewhere.  The meat literally fell apart with my fork, so tender and delicious.  Add the garlic sauce... forget about it.  Unreal.  Fresh minced garlic and olive oil, yum!  The rice was also tasty and some of the best I have ever had.  My bill for the chicken/kafta plate and Arizona Iced Tea was about $16.50, $19.50 out the door.... not cheap for lunch but I must say it was definitely worth every penny.  I will be returning as budget allows.
2	3KM9IiPrDUgRV39B7Ghw	Sushi is decent but very spendy. I don't care for the loud music or bad lighting. We've been there approx. 4 different times, staff not so friendly. Of all the places to choose from in the E. Valley now, this would not be our first choice.
2	rlPnXR1kaaKth3b7ommHLw	I had high hopes for some good pizza, and personally I was sadly disappointed. I'be spent the last month in Europe, where I was fortunate to have some very good pizza in Spain, and I was looking forward to compare it to that of my beloved Montreal.  My mother works close Pozzafiore and she told me that's where she goes to get we pizza fix. The menu had a lot of great choices ranging, 33 (I think) actually. Today I had the Fornorina (pizza with olive oil, rosemary, parsley, cheese and fresh tomatoes. Well I have to say it did not make it into my top 10 pizzas. The dough and pizza crust was below my standards, it was some and bread-like. The cheese was the normal grated mozzarella, not a huge fan after having good quality buffalo di mozzarella in Spain. The thing that was actually unforgivable was the lack of fresh tomatoes on the pizza. I counted 6 small half or quarter slices of a normal tomato. This was not at all what I was expecting, and definitely forced me to write this review.  On a more pleasant note, my mother had La Ch\u00e8vre pizza and I felt it was more satisfying than mine, mainly because it had more and different ingredients. It had tomato sauce, goat cheese, onions, Kalamata olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. It was actually not bad, and would have been better with different pizza dough in my opinion.  Well the one reason I have to go back to this pizzeria is not for the pizza but for the fries. Apparently they are seasoned extremely well and are hand-cut. Well that something that does sound good to me. Look for a review in the future when I DO try them. In the meantime anyone who goes here and tries the fries, let me know how they are.
4	UDfAfL1oPOGQP6cH6vQdDg	Although deep dish is not what I grew up eating in Chicago, thin was the only way unless out of town guests came in, this is by far the best deep dish I've had since heaving Chicago.  The guy lived in Italy, then moved to my area of Chicago, and then here.  It's a long wait but TOTALLY worth it.  Get the deep dish with sausage.  It's real sausage (not rabbit pellets).  YUMMY!
2	wyLjYm40MD9GOxh86uFow	When we walked inside and saw the menu we had high expectations for this place.   There are some very exotic sounding burger options, but I just went with a basic burger and fries.   The burger was pretty good, but a little dry. I get the feeling the people at Burger Studio paid more attention to (unsuccessfully) making the inside look sleek and modern than they did making sure they use high quality ingredients in their food.   Burger Studio is ok, but nothing special. They tried to make it a hip-modern burger place, but they failed.
2	tS7dfmu5KQCH9yKxxEOakw	I invited my friend for her birthday there.  She's from Algeria and Berber also. So I though it was a good idea.   We shared the couscous and the lamb.  The lamb was very tasty and tender but the couscous...dry.  We were quite disappointed.  Honestly, I made better couscous at home. This place can be perfect for people that doesn't know much about traditional Berber dishes.
2	iKNJ7n6UIfDK1wXSGpGlQ	Probably closer to 2.5.  Last time we went we walked out because the server couldn't get to our table in under 10 minutes.  Why, because as I've noticed before, they were talking to other customers.  Not taking orders or something else...they were flapping their jibs.  When your food is adequate at best, and the Red, White and Brew in your same parking lot has already gone out of business...now would be a good time to step up your game.
4	hGWY24QRqjtjMGp1nLsg	I was a bit unsure of what to expect, since I saw reviews all over the map of this place. However, I was in the mood for Mexican, and this place was convenient since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time.    When I arrived - between 1 - 1:30 on a weekday, I was seated immediately.  There were a few other tables with patrons so I wasn't the only person there at the time.   The service was pretty quick and menu offered all the standard options on a Tex-Mex menu.  Chips and salsa were brought out immediately and the chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland.  I had to ask for the spicy sauce to pep it up a bit.   For my lunch, I decided to go with the Pollo Fundido, and I must say it was one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.  The deep-fried tortilla was nice and crispy, and it was filled with plenty of pulled chicken and covered in a creamy-cheesy sauce.  It was served with a side of rice.   I was happy with the meal and my service was good.  Also, I don't normally order soda, but since they had Mexican Coca-Cola, I ordered one of those. They taste so much better when they are made with real sugar instead of the icky corn syrup that sweetens American sodas!   All in all, I was rather pleased with my visit and if I happen to be back in downtown Matthews with a hankering for Mexican, I will definitely stop back in!
2	BVltOOuGgQSgoglU7BwyXg	The buffet is decent (though I find the placement of the dessert table next to the washroom a little troubling) but I will never again visit King's Buffet after repeated bad experiences with their take out.   They have messed up my order every time I've ever gotten take out there (4 times). The first time I called to complain that they had forgotten an item (chicken balls) as well as the almonds for the chicken almond guy ding. The attitude of the woman on the phone was appalling. She kept telling me that SHE didn't forget, as if I was accusing her personally. YOU may not have forgotten, but last I checked, you still work for the company that DID forget. After they told us we'd have to drive all the way back to the store to make an exchange (30 mins+ round trip) we said to just forget it. No compensation was offered.   They have also messed up the pricing on my order every time. The older gentleman used to throw in a few cans of pop to compensate, but he was missing the last time I was in. Again, the attitude of the staff is disgusting. I was told that it was "only" $3. That's still $3 of MY money that you have taken for no reason. Learn some respect for your customers. In the meantime, I'll be going to the Mandarin for my Chinese food.
4	HLunJiaAhOlimRQg03Crfg	Judge this book by it's cover at your own peril!  It's not pretty on the outside.  It's not pretty on the inside.  Once you put your knife and fork to work, you will be planning what to order the next time you return!
4	xiTpJZPRH5JDIkEMFdUZA	This regional chain is the place to go to eat gigantic portions of good-enough pancakes and eggs surrounded by senior citizens and high school students.  The standout here is the surprisingly tasty, lacy-thin potato pancakes, which they serve, correctly, with apple sauce and sour cream.  The bacon pancakes are another welcome innovation.   Things to be aware of:  1.  Go weekday mornings to avoid long waits. 2.  Cash only.  3.  Many items can be ordered in half-portions (otherwise known as "normal-sized portions") making the OP an even cheaper place to have breakfast.
4	D106L7j1hwhG0pMwOqr7tg	Brother's Pizza has been there for as long as I can remember..   Going back to my high school days where that was a great after school hangout. I love this pizzeria! It's a pizzeria with such a strong family and community feel. It has never changed since the day I first set foot in it almost a decade ago.   They offer a great selection of pizza, beer, wings ect. Everything is ran like a family business, they truly care about their clientele. They love their customers so much you can just feel it! The order taker and staff is always so nice and welcoming.  They make everything the old style and it shows in their pizza! Thick layers of cheese and toppings the stretches as you take bites of this cheesy goodness! Brother's Pizza is delicious, that's why it's still standing on the lonely far westside after so many years :) A strong thread of regulars speak louder than reviews :)
4	uaCzLXB6OXPOLnIQfscc0w	Took one star because they are so stingy with condiments. You ask them and they still do mot give you much more.  Aside from that...food is pretty good. Good prices and good amount of food based on the low costs. I think they make the best Egg Fried rice over all dozens of Chinese places I've tried in Arizona.  Lunch specials are the best because they are cheap and depending on the size you get you get full with small or have left overs with a large lunch special. Lunch starts at $3.75.  They offer delivery even though I've seen they wait until they get enough orders before they drive off. So be warned your food might be sitting getting soggy and cold before it gets to your house.
2	ewDkLiEbefAKrx27q2hvVg	I attended a show at The Smiling Moose last night. I never really know with shows and concerts who is responsible for the sound, the rules, basically the all around stuff that makes up the experience of what you are seeing.   For the small space, the venue wasn't bad. It reminded me a lot of Brillobox with it's dark painted walls and upstairs setup. Just wasn't as big and not really as cool since they didn't have a bar upstairs where the show was going on. Seems like a big missed opportunity. There is room for one!   My main beef with The Smiling Moose is the drinking (or lack there of). So you want to let under-agers into the show? I get it. But if we are letting the young ones in and setting up some rules, why wasn't I informed of them before purchasing a strong IPA before the show was about to start!? We went down to the bar. Upon exiting the bouncer said to my friend in a matter-of-fact-you-are-an-idiot tone, "If you are under 21 you can't re-enter." "Ummm okay, I'm not under 21", he replied. "Well then I told you that you needed a wristband." Geesh dude, there was a band playing when he came in. Calm down.  We went downstairs (ugh) and got really great beers. The bar tender had to know we were there for a show since we came down the stairs at the same time as other people and the music from upstairs had stopped. So, we buy a beer, take it upstairs and the bouncer says "You can't have beer in here" like we should have already known his rules that were posted nowhere. So we had to go downstairs and basically chug our beers to make it up for the end of the first song.   All along a band member from the first set had come down to grab a beer too. The poor (literally) band member made a comment about how he couldn't believe there weren't specials for that band, since they get that a lot. Then he heads upstairs with his beer only to be sent back down to finish it. He had bought a dogfish head with the little money he had and was also forced to drink it fast to see the band he was touring with.  Maybe this place is great to just go in and chill. But the lack of friendliness from the staff and the lame rules for the bar were a huge turnoff. I suggested they play at Brillobox when they come back into town.
4	JSvbn8LS7pgK66sRHem76w	This place still has some of the best lunch specials in the Southpark area.  Before I spent two weeks in Thailand, I thought it was great.  Now I just think it is one of the best choices in Charlotte.
2	wCZjvXkGfUi2Es8t3C5FOw	This place has good food but they have begun to fall short in a couple of areas. They no longer have a CCSD teacher discount. They also had to repeat one order three times before it came out right. In addition, they rung up the order wrong this charging us incorrectly. The size of the queso has been diminished also. They were accommodating about their mistakes, but to many downers for us to return.
2	8JZ4MHMFuxJ3DbWwA4Hh7Q	I was wanting to find the pizza hut express to get one of those mini pizzas to take with me on the plane, but I didn't have the time to go look for it. I only had 50 minutes and I barely got there in time to line up with my section even though this was on the way.   I ordered a slice of supreme even though I wanted pepperoni. The guy in front of me ordered the last three slices for his family. How annoying!   Pros:  -It was relatively quick and the pizza was edible.   Cons:  -Did not have more pepperoni or cheese pizza ready to go, but had plenty of the less popular flavors. -Barely any pizza sauce on my pizza.  -Crust thicker than I'd like it to be for NY style pizza. -Pizza didn't seem as fresh and warm and other chains.  -Expensive- almost $5 a slice.  -Workers aren't that friendly.
4	EH3slopkKdPUmMGJRpo5A	Great breakfast!  It is a true hole in the wall joint, but the food is exactly what we like. My husband loves chicken fried steak and bisquits and gravy. He loved his. The serivce was perfect. As we were leaving 2 people on horses came and hitched the horses to the post.. It reminds you we live in the old wild west.
2	vNgYU5txKTTseVGb51Pw6A	It was a Saturday around lunch time, my girlfriend and I sat down at a table outside.  We were not in a rush by any standards.  You could tell that they were very much understaffed on the floor, because it looked like there was only one waitress running around trying to do everything. The restaurant was about 1/3 full.  We waited for about 10-15mins for our menus, it took us 5 minutes to choose what we would like to eat, and continued waiting for our waitress to stop by and take our order.  I am usually a patient person, but after another 15mins we decided to get up and leave. I was really hoping to try this place and what they offer, but 30mins before our order was even taken. Was enough for me.  Maybe next time
4	D2vfuTncEXblxc0e2tPxAg	Mexican food is delicious. No, really, Mexican food will be eaten, on average, 2-3 times a week in my household, mostly because Mexican food is almost always gluten free. There are cross contamination concerns, but if you befriend the restaurant owners/employees, it is amazing what they will do to make sure you aren't vomiting later that night due to gluten poisoning.   Between my fiance and I, we have eaten half of their menu. Also, compared to other Mexican restaurants, Fausto's [thankfully] lacks the grease factor.After we eat their food we are in food coma, not sitting at the side of the bed with a defibrillator in case the grease travels all the way to our hearts.  My fiance LOVES their burritos. When you ask for everything, you get it all, including pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, beans and whatever meat your heart desires. No extra charge for delicious guacamole? Sign me up! I, on the other hand, am a fan of the tacos. Two steak tacos with everything includes pico de gallo, guacamole and a healthy handful of perfectly cooked carne asada. Add some of their homemade green sauce and DING DING DING!!! We have a winner!!! Did I mention that their food lacks the unnecessary grease factor that haunts my waistline everyday? Good, fresh food without the need for a nap after consumption - love it!  However, I think our favorite dish so far is their SUPER NACHOS!!! I capitalize the name of this dish because holy freaking incredible, I love their nachos. Homemade fried tortilla chips are on the bottom. Then come the standard refried beans to add a little protein to this mess of a platter. The happiness comes next. In one corner, you have a scoop of slightly spicy (yay jalepenos!) pico de gallo. In the other corner, you have a healthy scoop of sour cream to cool the palette. In the next corner, a SIZEABLE portion of their homemade guacamole and then in the last corner that delicious guacamole mixes with another small serving of pico de gallo. As if that wasn't enough, they then add a little more guacamole here and there right before [happily] drowning the above ingredients with that savory carne asada (or chicken, pork, etc). Throw on some Mexican cheese and cheddar cheese and BAM!!! You have a meal of champions. No fake cheese sauce (save that for the ball parks), no unnecessary lumps of melted cheese that mask all other flavors of the dish, no grease, just simple, delicious nachos. They are hard to find and do without going over the top, and thankfully Fausto's does them right.  So stop by some time or call-in an order ahead of time to bring it home after a long day at work, because for Vegas, it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area and it makes my tummy nice and plump with Mexican food happiness.
2	oEwIk2GiN7yKehY6WfbFw	Visited this restaurant on Sunday 7.12.09 around 2pm for lunch. I walked into the place and saw a little bit of a difference in lighting from other PF Chang's I've been to. They actually had their curtains open to let in some natural light, which was really nice. You could see the place was clean and it gave the atmosphere a more of a casual vibe. I enjoy eating at places where it's a little more personable with the wait staff, which wasn't the case this afternoon. The wait staff on this afternoon wasn't focused on the customer, which was me. It seemed like a young crowd of wait staff that didn't want to work a Sunday afternoon. I didn't see any genuine smiles from them. They had the attitude of blah, blah blah, here's your food, bye. I ordered the peppercorn beef dish, and my husband ordered the kung pow dish extra spicy. For an app we had 4 spring rolls. The app didn't taste fresh, and the sweet and sour sauce served with it was bland. Our meals were a decent size but low on sauce for some reason. The rice was a little dry. And my husband's extra spicy kung pow didn't have any pow at all. So at this point I was asking myself, why eat here? I could have gone to any neighborhood Chinese place and have gotten the same quality of food with paying 1/2 the price.. I'm really considering being a little stuck up saying that these chain restaurants are expected to have a certain standard, and why can't they go above it to empress me to come back? I think in this type of economy I'm really going to start to eat at the more mom and pop places where you can feel the heart and soul that is put in the dinning experience. I probably am not going to go back to this chain because of this experience.
2	TtbpqpEB3PeA9PtDyy6Gw	I ate here today. I ordered a "Mediterranean" wrap. It was okay, except for the fact that I had to send it back and have it remade due to the 3 curly brown hairs adorning it as a garnish. That was pretty sick, but the staff was really nice and I liked the fact that they had low calorie options. All in all, it is a commercial space, nothing unique, but a decent place for a casual lunch.
4	duA4mfYs4yfOb00kmXtAMw	I ate dinner at El Pollo Supremo after reading about the place on Yelp.  I love grilled chicken and this place knows how to grill.  The chicken was lightly spiced and the skin had a red color.  At competing grilled chicken places the chicken is served luke warm, or cool.  This chicken was HOT and juicy.  The meat was tender and separated from the bone easily.    The beans and tortillas were tasty.  Tortillas were warm and heated on a stove not a microwave.  Yum Yum!  Carne Asada stands for 'grilled meat'.  Usually a skirt steak.  Prepared by a skilled griller (I know griller is not a word but it should be)  the meat is tender, and juicy.  When prepared by an amateur it can be used for shoe leather, or cheap tires.  The griller at El Pollo Supremo is an artist.  Two folks could split a combo dinner easily.    El Pollo Supremo is in a small strip mall.  Upon entering the restaurant you place your order at the counter and can take a look at the small kitchen where the magic happens.  The place is old.  The fixtures and tables are old.  Nothing wrong with old, it just sort of hard to keep old stuff clean.  The proprietors do a good job of keeping the place neat and clean.      The reason for only four stars is their drink policy.  They charge for refills.  I can see charging for refills on Horchata but not Pepsi.  It's a minor thing, maybe I'm too cheap!    You can leave your plastic at home, cash only here.  Don't tell the IRS!
4	ggFD3lRPZ2Xti6ghr3Pw	very frequent guest of this location and have never left upset of the food or service.  all the staff is friendly from the busboys on up to management.  their food is good and reasonable and large servings.  I have eaten here for all meals the only thing I would not reorder is the Cadillac meatloaf, everything else has been superb!
2	ZP9k7RCgkwWNMQxSngUF7g	I stopped in here for lunch the other day and was fairly underwhelmed.  The food wasn't terrible, but the price to quality ratio was quite high and the food overall was uninspiring.  Also, I wasn't asked what side I wanted with my sandwich and was just given a bag of chips...oh well.  The baked goods and breakfasts looked pretty good, and I've enjoyed this in the past, but as far as the lunch goes I don't plan on going back anytime soon as much more innovative options can be had in the area for the same price or less.
2	Lj491rMa2JPQjoLgmznRA	Geez.  I wish I'd travel with people that have some friggin sense of adventure.  Would have much rather have checked out the Omelet House in Vegas, so allow me to vent.  That said, this place is adequate.  Convenient to gas, restrooms, and store.  NOTHING spectacular.  Similar to an IHOP or a Denny's.  Prices maybe a little better.  Ordered a BLT.  Standard fare.  They brought out everything but the BLT.  Forgot to make.  Also, shouldn't have ordered the cole slaw.  Yuck.  They took it back and told me to help myself to the soup.  Sandwich, when it arrived, was good.  Wait staff was friendly.  Parking was plentiful.  Come here if you've missed anything interesting because there is nothing else for miles beyond.  Don't forget to fill the tank.  BTW.  They actually serve your food on a skillet.  An aluminum skillet :-)
2	sQ1JjdWlWNj3Pu7bVeYEQ	Small, dark, crowded, meh.  They're just trying too hard here, and it's just not working.  My friend was in town so we decided to get some sushi.  As we were closer to Sushi Rock than Sushi Avenue, we thought, "what the hell, we're too lazy to walk back down Green".  With the space being as small as it is, having a waitress bustling up and down the narrow aisles, hovering over your table waiting to take your order and/or refill your water was just annoying.  And the super dim lighting I guess is their attempt at creating a romantic ambiance?  But the fact you're sitting right on top of the brightly lit kitchen and/or right next to the constantly opening/closing front door makes it aggravating more than anything.  $10 for a spider roll? Gimme a break.  I can get two rolls, and a bowl of miso soup from Sushi Avenue for the same price!  Plus, you don't have to tip at Sushi Avenue.  So what does Sushi Rock have to offer that you can't get just a few blocks down Green at Sushi Avenue?  Mmm... maybe the fact they serve alcohol?  Even then.. meh.  Don't get me wrong, the sushi here isn't bad, but it's nothing special either.  I just prefer the hands-off approach of Sushi Avenue.
4	F5fe4jJbVQx1SWjszHgIEA	Updated 3/2012. Their flights of wine and service are still good but on my last two visits I thought their food quality had slipped a bit so I think a four star rating is now appropriate.  Sorry I could not agree with Mariangela. My experiences there have all been good. Their flights of wine are always fun to try and I have never had a bad meal there. I do agree that the service is very friendly and pretty professional.  It is a good restaurant to bring guests to as they always seem to enjoy the evening. The parking is valet, but not snobbish as they parked by old pickup right up front.
2	Dc6Kd2K2QmKCl7Tq7EN1fQ	Very similar to Filiberto's. Very small location with picture menu featuring all their combos...you know the usual suspects... 2 tacos w/rice n beans, or 1 enchilada with taco and rice n beans...get it? one downfall is that they don't have a salsa bar. If you want salsa you can grab some pre-packed lil containers of red salsa they have in this little fridge, but it's not the best. I prefer places with salsa bars where you can get jalepenos and carrots and a variety of salsas. Anyways, my hubby got the carne asada fries which were really good (how can you F#$% this up?) and I got a combo of cheese enchilada and bean tostada. The rice and beans beat Filibertos hands down, but the enchilada wasn't anything spectacular. This place is ok and I'll go back since it's right up the road from my casa.
2	Z6vdiH6AMGgktlMIH6b6cw	We were recently at Geisha a Go-Go for a friends birthday for dinner and karaoke.  First we did dinner, then karaoke in the BIG room, which was a blast.  My issue was our waitress. We were there on a Tuesday night and we were some of the only people in the place, so the excuse "it was just really busy" doesn't apply.  A couple of us ordered Hot Rock dinners, which were supposed to come with rice. Our meals came with no rice and when we brought it up to the waitress, the following conversation ensued:  Us: Hi, I think our meal is supposed to come with rice, right? Waitress: Yeah, but usually the meat is filling enough, so I didn't bring it out. Us: Okay, but it's listed on the menu. Waitress: I know.  Um, I'm still being charged for it, right? And the Shrimp Hot Rock meal came with 3 shrimp and a tiny Asian salad.  Wow, how filling. There were other issues with her service, like bringing out the other, more expensive wine that I didn't ask for twice.  I will probably never go back to Geisha for a meal, but it is a good place for drinks at the bar with friends on the weekend. Or on a weeknight if you don't want a big crowd but fun atmosphere.  The reason for the "Meh, I've experienced better" rating, and why it is not at an "Eek! Methinks not" is because we did have a good time...when we didn't have to deal with the waitress.
2	srZZT48nAUMXml3IfZbwA	When I came here the other day, it was as If all the employees were stoned.  Haha. Seriously. They were out of chicken, steak and salsa. There were no small drink cups ready. There were no clean trays ready for in-store dining. The cashier forgot to ring me up for a drink (because there were no cups). She forgot to grab a bag of chips I had paid for. She asked me 3 times which beer I wanted. 3 times, apologizing saying she forgot.   Yikes. There was only 2 people in front of me and my friend and it took us (not exaggerating) 18 minutes to get through the line and to the table.
2	Dy5QJB5lxXmuKmNeIrkHjw	Really hate to do this, but this was my favorite bar to eat at until now! I didn't realize they switched to No One Under 21 till I walked in with my kids for dinner and was told that we had to leave! No sign posted anywhere! They have great food here and I'll never go back because the obvious didn't care about local families when the decided to allow smoking! What's wrong with the patio if you want to smoke?
4	7EPKJm7bB6EsW0Ke0lRWKg	I have to be honest, the first time I ate hear was out of curiousity! Come on with a name like that... You should of seen the billboard Ad. Let me just say they had very long chop sticks, LOL!!!! =P   Everytime I'm in Vegas, I have to eat here especially if I'm with friends. For some reason they never believe you when you tell them where you what to eat.   The Pho is actually pretty good along with the spring rolls and egg rolls. If your tired of all the buffets on the strip or your looking for a cheap place to eat, just head over to China town.
4	Z4KbtOQ7E8GZXykJlHhkOQ	Came for the awesome shakes & fries. We usta come here sit at the front window & watch cars & ppl. But there were too many transient ppl here slummin & loitering. Came here today tables clean, quiet, organized & helpful. I ordered the vanilla shake real thick & flavorful. Gson got the strawberry shake he could barely get the thick ice cream through the straw. The fries were crispy on the outside yummy on the inside.
4	LIfcD5AQEwLI4dlUq2XjQ	First, I'll admit I'm a die-hard Taco Bell fan... but beyond that, I've always gotten great service from this location. They're always nice to me in the drive-thru and their service is usually quite fast. I recommend it all the time.
2	wbC6BYZbIt2796RlfXu3ig	Extr\u00eamement d\u00e9\u00e7u. Staff were extremely rude to us. When we arrived, not one staff acknowledged us. It was our first time there and we weren't sure if you sat yourself. So we waited. Someone finally made eye contact and pointed a finger to wait. No smile. He gave us the worst table in the restaurant, despite being mostly empty. When the server came over he appeared nice but spoke extremely quickly and abruptly. The server was not very attentive to us. We had to call out to him every time we wanted something.  We asked for the bill and paid in cash. We left it on the table and were preparing to leave. We slowly made our way out. And when we got outside, a staff member was running to catch up. He accused us of walking out on our bill. He hadn't even been to the table and he wasn't even aware that our server had already brought us our bill and was then tidying up our table. We had left cash and tip on the table.  I could see our table from the window and the server was there cleaning up. I don't know why this staff member thought we would walk out on our bill. There was no reason to suspect us for that. He was not our server nor did he come to our table once while we were there. We were extremely offended. We felt the staff were behaving rudely towards us and that scene at the door reinforced our impressions. Despite the beer being good, we would never go back nor would we ever recommend this place.
4	9CsT9scBkddhQ3dQZqtwOg	Chicken marinated and grilled to crispy skin perfection over an open flame. I love it. I love it so much I could marry it. Only if I did, we would never have kids since she'd be barren from all the flame grilling and marinating.  I'm not sure that's the life I envisioned as a young man.  I want a couple more kids, but not with a flame-broiled chicken.                                               i don't care how hot she is.   The pollo bowl is only five bucks...'bout a half of a breast, rice and beans in a six inch bowl. Quite a lot actually.  EIther get here at 11:30 or wait until after 1:30, when after the lunch crowd subsides.  Be prepared for panhandlers standing just outside the door asking for loose change. Such a great hood.  Enjoy.
2	GwcWVMCQoYket1xMakPP2Q	I, too, had high hopes for this Spanish restaurant but walked away disappointed.  Bland, seemingly pre-frozen food with absolutely no hint of freshness and distinction.  It's a great place to drink and munch on tapas (after drinking quite a bit), if you're lucky enough to have a good server.
2	HTTc4zHBiCxc9KOE6ScIwg	I think this place may have changed ownership since some of the reviews were posted. The name has changed as noted in another review. The food was fair, but nothing to write home about. The pork was good, but a bit overcooked. The biggest disappointment was the tostones (fried green plantain) they were dry and tasteless and if I had to guess they were reheated from the day before, blah! I have no Latin American background, but even I can cook better at home. The beans and rice were good as were the variety of homemade sauces (chimichurri and salsa tomatillo) they bring to the table. The servers were polite and they were quick but I wouldn't go for a second visit.
4	iyDKyJJdCe75OvVLZztqKA	We go to this store because it's close to our house. The place is clean. They just got new tables and chairs. We love the breakfast burritos they offer. The lunch and dinner items are very good as well. The price is reasonable. They are open 24 hours. My first choice for a quick breakfast.
2	ni367OSy0QI1swsn0Zx6xw	This isn't the worst place I have ever been, but I really don't like the atmosphere. It is dark and dingy in here, and to top it off, it isn't really decorated like anything. I am really big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge doesn't have any whatsoever. The drinks are okay... but I have definitely seen better bars. It's nice if you're just looking for somewhere close on the westside.
2	8e6yQa0N8MUzwvx4qQchvA	I've had better crepes, and I find their crepes overpriced.   Their selection of food is tiny, and I rarely find anything that I want to order off the menu.  Their coffee might be pretty good, but I don't drink coffee and I find their tea pretty average.  They do have beer though.    I'm glad I tried it, but it's unlikely that I'll come back here in the future.  There are better breakfast options in Madison.
2	XQtWUQma0h7MDvjPAdFixA	The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip.
2	1jkTrdBLs0guW0Fp8pFug	Ordered two 44 strawberry fruit slush and one corn dog.  Gave 5.39, bill was 3.39 and Serena tries to give me $1.00 and change back and two 32 oz drinks.  :-( I brought change to her attention and had to check size on cup. On a more recent trip through the drive through I again had a similar experience in which the cashier at the window did not give me all my change.   I'm not tipping a buck to these people when I come through the drive through.  Seriously, this is ridiculous that they even attempt to pull off this little maneuver.
4	vog7v7tWnqeJFkSLc29Xmw	We stopped in for an appetizer and some beer on a stupid hot and humid day.    We were doing some sightseeing in Pixburgh and, of course, had to hit the incline.     Staff was friendly - they have $2.50 Blue Moon on tap on Saturdays!  YAY!   We split the 3 dip app and it was really really good!
2	zUEvvP260HQt6T9IXD2ysw	Pretty good sushi in Queen Creek. We started out with the shrimp and veggie tempura $10.99 and it was very good (5 pieces of big shrimp and broccoli, bell peppers, onion, zucchini, yam). We also ordered miso soup $3.50, which was freaking huge! We thought it was going to be a small bowl like at most sushi places for like $1.50 but out came this giant bowl that could easily feed 3 people! We wish our waiter warned us. Then I ordered the sashimi platter $15 (disappointed that i had to order a bowl of rice $2.50 since it didn't come with it, non-traditional) and we ordered a rainbow roll $11.50. The sashimi slices were very fresh and thick cut and delicious. The rainbow roll was very good too! I probably wouldn't return just because I know of another sushi place where you get miso soup and rice with all your meals which equals a less expensive bill.
4	HJDuopG1z5lEA5awZOF2g	I am not a Chinese expert by any means but I thought this was a really good lunch spot. Sketchy looking for sure, but fast, friendly service and the food was really good. I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special. All the veggies were really fresh. Chicken, of course, looked questionable but I've never had Chinese food with "good" chicken. Fried rice was good although no eggs or veggies in it. Egg drop soup very salty but good and the egg roll was crispy. All for $6. I'll definitely be back.
2	nPCfcMdnSDGN9K11LERA	It was an interesting experience, but I don't think I would go again.  I took my friend to this restaurant as part of her bachelorette weekend.  The experience was very interesting and a bit scary at times (I almost panicked couple of times, it is scary to be in total darkness), but the food wasn't amazing.  I had the avocado salad and steak for the main course.  Also, I have talked about this kind of experience with my blind friend, and he said he didn't like this kind of restaurants, because it doesn't accurately show how a blind person's life is like.  All of a sudden not being able to see when we always depended on sight is quite different from being blind all your life.  But I guess if you want to experience something different from typical restaurants, you can try this place!
2	O6OcNhiYShti7nhV1oIPA	This restaurant had so much potential and I was quite excited to try it. My friends were in Montreal from out of town and wanted to try a French restaurant close to where they were staying. I made a reservation for 20:30 but apparently when my friends arrived, the door was locked and the manager told them that they thought the reservation was for 20:00. After that little mishap, we were seated and we were the only people in the entire restaurant. Sure, it was a Monday night, but this was a bit shocking to be completely alone. The decor is quite nice with a little enclosed patio area and a fountain.  We ordered a cheese plate to start which was quite expensive for what it was. We had bleu cheese, oka and another soft cheese. None of these were that impressive but since we were hungry, we finished the plate anyway. I had their special salad which was greens with strawberries. The salad was doused in dressing- so much that I could not taste anything else except the bitterness of the vinegar. For dinner, I had smoked gnocchi with proscuttio and sun dried tomatoes. This dish just fell flat- it was really bland and unimpressive. My friend ordered octopus salad and found that it was equally bland.   We also ordered a bottle of wine and they didn't have the one we requested. They brought us another one which was extremely bitter and tasted quite cheap. The bill at the end was quite shocking given the quality of the food. It's safe to say that we won't be coming back here. Luckily, the night was redeemed with a trip to Ripples.
4	IPOuWP345HKVOnsgP1JA	This place and New Tokyo Market are the only Asian places I've found so far in Arizona that's really JAPANESE.    The store is pretty small but has enough things to stock up your pantry until your next trip to L.A.    *Cosmetics/Bathroom = ok selection *Rice = several kinds *Snacks = plenty *Dried stuff = plenty (Curry, Dried Seaweed, etc) *Frozen stuff = good amount (Natto, Udon, Ramen, Tsukemono, etc) *Drinks = good selection of Japanese soft drinks  The one complaint I have is that they don't have fresh fruits or vegetables.  You can find them in other markets like Asiana market or Lee Lee's.
4	vDDcqkSvd4uLfYhLPjDYSg	Played 18 holes in under 3 hours. It truly has rolling hills which provided a challenge for a beginning golfer. The round with a cart was very affordable at only $14. The scenery was very pretty with mountain views everywhere.    The staff was very friendly and helped me find a pair to go out with as I had booked my tee time 20 minutes before showing up.   This course is a hidden gem for locals (I live 8 miles from here and didn't know it existed) It is however just a municipal course but I did love the cart path and the greens were nicely maintained.  If you are a serious golfer I would stay away but for beginners like me this place was great.
4	y8ewo9g482eeyHiFJaIDQ	Great ambience! Beside the river, city view, within a few feet of a train track, and food is good for a chain. Eat outside! Service is excellent. Everytime I have eaten here the manager has walked over to ask how everything is.
2	aNE1rIkvjYKmPCcJaKpEfg	I decided to come back and give it a try....ok maybe I didn't "decide" but I tried to find 2 other BBQ places Bird & Bones Premium Pit Barbeque on E Desert Inn- closed & Barbeque Masters Wood Smoked Eatery on Horizon Ridge in Henderon which I just couldn't find  and well I knew where this place was.   When I pulled up there were people out back bbq'ing  on an open pit and it smelled really good.  They have the big $5 lunch special sign out front and after looking over the menu I was disappointed they only serve chicken,ribs and links here.  No brisket, NO pork loin, no bratwurst, no chili,no mac & cheese  I ordered a 2x2-ribs & 1/4 white chicken plus potato salad & baked beans  The bbq sauce was very sweet and it covered everything. The beans were canned and the potaot salad was creamy. Really creamy?? Whats up with that?  The ribs were tough and gristly with way too much sweet sauce on them. The chicken was juicy but crisy and the sauce worked well with it.  I wouldn't go out of my way again but some people might like that outdoor bbq flavor.
2	BFPOpfm2m2drkRyXfBtNkQ	I am sorry to pour on everyone's parade, but this place isn't all that.  This is the sister restaurant to the one in Monterey Park, CA.  Okay that is dead central Asian community, many may say this place can't compare and it's not bad for Vegas.  I am sorry I have to be fair and honest.  If you have been to the other restaurant then you will know that this place can NOT hold a candle.  For the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/same-store-in-different-states-not-same.html  First off, this place is located in the most remote area.  It's back behind the more popular stores, away from the eyes of people.  There wasn't that many people there and when you go in you will see the people working there just sitting around chatting, which is fine.  We immediately went to get some small plate dishes.  My favorite at the one in Monterey Park is the "Fu Chi Fei Pian", which they had here.  It tasted somewhat similar but not quite.  Yes, it is spicy but it lacks real flavor.  My family really liked the Dan Dan Mien and they thought that was really good, but what I really wanted there was the Wontons in Chili Oil.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! It was just pure chili oil and no flavor.  The one in Monterey Park is spicy and emanates flavor.  I didn't really care for the wontons either.  It really was just not that good.  I am glad we only came for an after dinner snack.  So disappointing after reading the rave reviews.  I was so excited to find out that this was the same chain as the one in Monterey Park.    Yelpers, you got my hopes up and really let me down.  My family is pretty Chinese and my sister LOVES spicy food, but none of us really liked this place.  I guess for Vegas you can settle?  But I don't believe that to be true because Vegas has tons of great restaurants.  This place just doesn't measure up.  Sorry.
4	JVARBJy8TK0TOhAtaGFqw	This is a great and cozy place close to my parents home. It's nice to go and meet friends and just relax. Going off what Ky S. said, the staff at the Fitchburg location is particularly rude. There are always 2-3 people in there doing other things than monitoring the register. I will stand there for a good 5 minutes just to have them pour a cup of regular old coffee for me... I never order anything fancy. Other than the staff being careless human-beings its an excellent place to relax after a long day in big comfy leather chairs and couches and just have a nice conversation.
4	scGA32gr4ggIpDXTpJY7zA	I have always had good service and the food has always been delicious. The price is not to bad and I enjoyed the atmosphere. My wife enjoys the relaxed feeling. I have taken my parents also and they really enjoyed the food. The wine helps make it a well rounded place to eat.  Sometimes the place can be pretty full so choose the time and be prepared to wait.
2	dvQgO5pl7ejkfAK9ebu0A	**Be sure to check your order before you leave this McDonald's. It's always missing some food item.**  This has happened to me 6 different times over the past 4 months. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time? It's not something you normally think about when you're in the drive thru, that "Oh yeah this is the one that ALWAYS leaves something out!" Plus, I've had other family members go get my order and forgot to warn them. It won't happen again because I'll never go back or send anyone else there.  When I call the manager , he's always apologetic and says he'll replace the missing item but that's always a big inconvenience. Who wants to drive all the way back?  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's the only McDonald's up in North Phoenix that has the game pieces throughout the entire Monopoly Game season. Other McDonald's run out the first few days or the first week. I guess this is the only McDonald's that doesn't let employees pilfer the pieces.
2	lGKDBSjJtsHzv76j09SgmQ	Why is there no broccoli? I think concept is brilliant but the choices seem really arbitrary. Which region of China has pineapple, corn, and cucumbers but no broccoli, bok choi, or cabbage? The food tastes okay and maybe I will go back for meat .  Ordered: Noodles with tofu, corn, onion, carrots, lotus root with Ginger Scallion Sauce
2	AAaV77HJ7xsaJNu48QZeg	Rampart was a buffet I expected more from.  The wife and I checked it out at about 5:30PM, hoping to get in early and avoid the crowds. Unfortunately the average age of Rampart Casino guests seems to be about 70, so the place was absolutely PACKED and there were more than a few walking frames and so forth adding to the bedlam inside.  Once we eventually got seated our servers seemed harried, the food stations were absolutely hammered and needed replenishment and drink service was slow due to inadequate staffing due to the crowds.  The food was of reasonably quality, although a bit on the bland side for my liking. Clearly catering to an elderly crowd.  I enjoyed my T-Bone steak and some sort of almond gravy meatballs, but overall it wasn't an experience I'd care to repeat without a very good coupon.
2	UYCU5k96PQy1zQJvrshkoA	Went here cause I've heard from a few people it was good. Being a huge fan of Mexican food, I had to check it out. Pretty nice happy hour special, half off appetizers. Very nice staff. Food was just ok. Queso dip was the consistency of water. Valle luna is still the best i've had. Manager was very helpful and eager to please, but the food was just ok.
2	Em8sbMG1CUvWNx0YdrirEQ	We found Pasta Palace by running into it while getting a Starbucks at The Palace Station, which is a very budget oriented hotel.  Surprisingly Pasta Palace turned into a gem; the food was quite good, the prices were downright cheap and the service was good given that the hotel Palace Station is an absolute dump.  But alas, it didn't last...while in bankrupcy, the hotel is cutting costs everywhere and on our last trip to Pasta Palace, the food quality went down in a big way; the portions cut considerably and the prices went up.  It now looks and feels like fast food Italian, which is  too bad.  But if you want really inexpensive Italian and food quality isn't a consideration, it could be a decent choice but it's not the gem it once was.
2	dwpCNCR1YztEu65nHGfA	I grew up in Markham so I know about the art of eating dim-sim:  Tea (5/5) - "Too legit" Teapot (5/5) - "Looks like the one I pour in my dreams" Tea Cup (5/5) - "Ceramic like all the dinnerware, It even had a small chip in it" Table (5/5) - "Environmentally unfriendly layers of disposable plastic covers" Chopsticks (5/5) - "The light yellow ones" Crystal Skin Shrimp Dumplings (4/5) - "Oddly legit" Rice Noodle Roll (3.5/5) - "Almost legit" Rice Noodle Fried Dough (3/5) - "Very bland; no seasonings or sauce" Egg Tart (2.5/5) - "At least it was the puff pastry kind" Curry Octopus (2/5) - "Unsatisfying" Chicken Feet with Black Bean Sauce (2/5) - "Rather off-putting" Spareribs with Black Bean Sauce (1/5) -"Completely off-putting" Deepfried tentacles!? (0/5) - "What the &$#! is this"  It was also not cheap! So try not to order everything that comes to mind. There is authenticity to this place, the owners are Cantonese and some dishes do hit the right spots. If you're feeling homesick it will definitely help but don't expect anything to blow you away.
4	qdzrS3z64w411MyPuQLM6w	Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.  Long-Winded Review: When I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of "Japanese" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of "custom" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.  The real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.  Desserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price.
4	nZF5W7gk3Rplnwy2pKMxA	I didn't really eat at this place, but it's a must return.  I love their ambience...Got the western rustic mexican restaurant feel with a huge back patio covered with trees and x-mas lights.  Might I recommend sitting out there.  I enjoyed just hangin there.  Dude that can play and sing Nora Jones - kudos bro!  They have live music I gathered on Friday nights.  The main band played one Fleetwood Mac and one Maroon 5 -- yes that's it....wha! Yeah, I know just a tease and the rest were in Spanish.  Regardless nice hangout spot if you happen to be around downtown Chandler area :)
2	SZSdsuZgkg1oPSjRwD2A	This is the poor man's Ah-So, so if you've been to that place, you can totally understand and stop reading now.  For those of you that make it a habit to eat good sushi, I don't know if this place will satisfy you. The interior is beautiful, and you'll see a hostess or two sporting kimonos. You have a choice of sitting at a table and ordering some grilled food (the price goes all the way up to $40 steak), or sitting at the sushi bar, which is what I came for.  It wasn't bad at all, 3-stars worthy, but like everything else, the price was a little bit up there. Poor Tolleson/Avondale residents...it's like they don't have a better place to go.
4	ubT6ysDbbMfUgAYwsSkcAg	Great food & delivery service! The pad thai is delicious and is somewhat spicy, which I loved! Portion is generous, but a little smaller than Kung Fu Thai & Chinese for the same price. Also - great lunch and dinner specials! I will definitely be ordering from here again!
2	IhiGKvDejDdpALGdkSYjEw	O.K. so I did like my food but my main problem here is that for a set lunch it's $8.95 but if you choose certain options it's $1.00 more....Alright so far that's fine with me, an option for $1.00 more is Barbecue Short Ribs-I'm thinking" Hell Yeah"- Then my food comes and it's literally 4 short ribs minus the meat- Yup, for $1.00 more- so actually for $9.95 I got 4 mini short rib bones and a few little fatty pieces.... Umm, Why even offer that as an option if you are gonna be so stingy-maybe if I were a dog and ate bones I would've felt satisfied but I'm not. Even if I were given 2 small pieces with the short rib intact (meat & bones) I would be more happy understanding that with a lunch special you will get a smaller portion but c'mon.... So I did think the food was tasty, the short rib fatty pieces/bones tasted good(too bad I had no meat to eat), tempura good, loved the salad dressing and the OG Roll good but not great (could've been more hot). OG Special- Spicy Salmon, Avocado, Yum Yum Sauce & Scallions Topped with Tabasco I would go back and be willing to try other items, items without bones that is!!!!
4	NiJ8Wr9gI05HQkkLWmtyA	oh wow. What an experience! My boyfriend and I went to Razz's for his birthday on the recommendation of a friend. Thank you Kimberly! The food was amazing and eating up at the bar with Razz himself was the best. We were originally sitting at the bar side of the tasting area, but they moved us over to the kitchen side of the tasting counter as soon as the party that was there left without a complaint! It was great being able to talk to Razz about the food as it was set in front of us and there was so much to talk about. From the amazing grouper belly with black beans and red miso, to the ox tail over polenta with avocado relish, to the seafood beggars pouch in philo with a spicy tomato cream sauce. Everything was delicious and the small tasting portions let you try all these amazing flavors without being uncomfortably full. The wine pairings were also amazing, and that's coming from someone who rarely drinks reds.  All in all, a GREAT experience. I'm holding out on that 5th star for the price. Wish it was a little more affordable. The wines definitely pushed it over the edge.
2	JjcmxeKgJuN9coGFsrNQ	I agree with the other yelpers.  I didn't expect much though - I mean it IS a buffet.  But I thought since I was in Vegas, I had to do the whole buffet thing and we were staying at the Excalibur, so it was convenient.  I have to say it was exactly what I expected.  It did stink that they didn't have any alcohol too.
4	ueEb6mj8v0LW1wXN0Q84hQ	I'm originally from NE Ohio and I'd never seen a Chipotle that didn't have a line of people going out the door. But this one on S. Eastern is often empty when I go there. That made me nervous, but maybe it's because there are so many Mexican and Mexican-style restaurants in the area already.  The food here is just as good as any other Chipotle, and the place looks clean.  The staff are friendly and service is pretty quick.  I've never eaten there- I always get takeout. Parking is a problem because there are other restaurants in the area, so unless you like waiting for a place to park or don't mind having to walk a bit, I'd suggest going during the times that most people aren't headed out to restaurants.
4	wt0DUiTnpuarRscTDzaw	We went yesterday because my daughter loves Chuck E. Cheeses (I'll be honest, I'm not a fan). Overall, we had fun. My daughter enjoyed it very much and all the games were functional (at least the ones my daughter wanted to play). Noticed that their pizza menu was modified and now they offer options for "adults" like chicken BBQ pizza. We'll be back, so far is the best Chuck E. Cheeses we have been in Vegas (the other ones we've been to were crazy and filthy).
4	CUYrWow6IPKCqaYjMuPo3A	Serving on Jury Duty, it is close to the Courthouse.  A couple of the gals that I am serving with, came in today.  I ordered Shrimp Kung Pao, without the peanuts, or almonds, and white rice.  It was delicious, spicy as in the description, with lots of shrimps, and vegetables, and I ordered white rice.  My companion ordered the exact same thing, with fried rice.. and the other gal ordered a combination #1, and asked for chicken, instead of pork.  I know she was disappointed with the chicken, as it was all dark meat.  Overall, a good meal, we drank water, had a waitress that looked like she was 80 years old, but was very efficient.
2	TiNwK9Ih03ao7CWX1jsx1Q	Meh.  One word says it all.   Given its prices, this place is really not worth your time, money, and appetite. With prices hovering around $25+ for a dinner, you would really expect some better quality cuisine. Not this place. The staff is unapproachable, the food was cheap, and the menu is rather limited.  The quality of food was especially unimpressive. You can sense that the food was made several hours ago only to be left out at room temperature conditions until you scribbled down your command on the order sheet. In fact, Kanda has recently been identified by Resto-Net, a food safety watchdog, as having FAILED multiple food safety inspections (see here http://resto-net.ca/).   At this rate, you really should just do your wallet a favor and walk across the street to the Burger King. At least you know you are paying for junk food at that joint.
4	YObO9LpUEKKa5f7JbslZA	We're not natives, but come out for spring training each year and stumbled into Charleston's on one of our trips about four years ago. The price, ambiance, and service make this a must-see every time we go. A fantastic menu with food that really outstrips the price, Charleston's reminds me of what the mostly-defunct Houston's chain should have been, if they hadn't had such steep prices.  Reservations accepted, and they might be needed on busy nights.
4	Oiv56m8LRRUb3UeBgy2CtQ	I've gotten a few dishes from here over the last few years and the food is WAY better than Chiang Jiang, the other Verona chinese joint, but Dragon City doesn't deliver. It's too bad too, because I'd order exclusively from them if they did - what was it Jim Gaffigan said - I really like your food, just not enough to come down there and get it?
4	SkzqD2Y4NAckw6qPTD9jmQ	Sushi boat offers decent, but definitely not spectacular, sushi at a good price.  The service is pretty quick and it's a nice place to stop off for food.  The staff here is friendly, and the atmosphere clean and simple.  I wouldn't get too excited about some of their house special sushi types, they do the traditional rolls decent enough.
2	bgSbJAUFR2pkomlyeNPs7Q	Meh, I've experienced better at this very same restaurant.  Twenty five years ago this restaurant was considered a great dining establishment and my family would go here for special occasions.  Every now and then we'll go here to reminisce and enjoy some BBQ.  Wow, have times changed.  I came here recently with my family and they had a new menu, not that great.  I had a BBQ sandwich which lead to an upset stomach all night long.  The restrooms were disgusting!  The only good thing I can say is that the service was and always has been great.  I can't imagine ever going back to this place again.  It's just too gross now.  Fair well!
2	TbrhLthiQjtHl6dmNQGg	This place was King's table Asian Buffet at one time, then it folded and then it was some other Asian Buffet and it folded again. We've dined there when it was King's Asian Buffet and it was just barely ok. Then once again at the second identity and we never went back again. Yesterday we tried for the third time as Ta Ta Bistro. Very impressive decor when we stepped inside (previously it was just a casual buffet set up). Nice fish tank, teppanyaki tables and as reported quite roomy inside. The menu had lots of choices with specials for lunch and dinner. A mix of Chinese and Japanese combined in one setting, hmmm?  seemed interesting. We picked several sushi selections off the order sheet and a roll #44 called the "touchdown". The sushi was just marginal, with no real outstanding flavors or presentation. The spider roll (deep fried softshell crab) had what is probably a pre-fried crab tempura that was refried a second time to "freshen" it up, shameful! Roll #44 was not a touchdown, but sadly a fumble. Seemed to be a deep fried creation with what we think is probably thousand island dressing as the accent sauce (blah!). I thought it was below average and my wife was throughly convinced and disliked it 100%. Overall impression was not very good and we won't be going back anytime soon.  Is it Chinese or Japanese? Which way is this restaurant leaning towards? Well when the bill arrived, there was the tell tale sign....2 fortune cookies. Maybe it's a Chinese restaurant trying to go both ways? Whatever the direction, we didn't like it very much. Our third visit under 3 different owners and like baseball. 3 strikes and we're out.  So to this Bistro, we sadly wave Ta Ta.  :-(
2	8CDcF9tEMlFS7azTY4Xykw	A burrito a day kept the ramen away when I was an undergrad in California. Not only was Chipotle delicious, but also a great value.   Yet, as I keep coming to this location, I keep being underwhelmed.   Burritos, once $5ish, are now in the $6-7 range.  That $1.75 plastic cup of  guacamole, once bursting at the seams, is now filled by an air bubble (this isn't a bag of chips!!!)  The chips seem stale and not as lemony-salty as they should be.  The chicken is usually a miss, being over-seasoned and over-cooked.  My final straw was getting a part of a plastic bag along with my barbacoa o, which I discovered in my mouth. Yum.    I still love Chipotle, but this location needs to improve its quality if you expect people to pay your increasing prices. I'll be back to check, but I am not going to hold my breath.
2	hbtBe5wQni4SnGQ3s3R0Pg	Franco's seemed to be the last stop of our drunken retreat back to our student halls at Sciennes while I was in first year, and it soon became recognised as the source for a "guaranteed stomach hangover".   My main gripe with Franco's is the lack of freshness.  I've had too many suppers that have been sitting out under the lamp for most likely hours.  I'm a fan of my puddings, and on the few occasions I've had a black or white pudding supper, they have been extremely dry and tasteless. The batter here is also far too chewy.  What's worse, after a certain time, they refuse to cook you anything fresh and will only offer you what they have already prepared. The chips are OK, yet have a tendency to be too soggy and certainly nothing on the nearby competition.   The prices are not too bad, however given the quality of what you are paying for, you're much better off forking out a bit more and going to one of the other nearby chippies (Newington Traditional Fish Bar on the next street for one).   The one saving grace is the large portion size of the fish supper, giving an excellent fish to chip ratio. Aside from that however, probably one to avoid unless the purse strings are tight.
4	eC14f1bfGyOsfooV7JgEIA	Joe Mama's has two great times to go.  1) Late night half-price food. 11 PM. Your whole party has to be there to get a seat. Food selection is limited, but your meal ends up being about $5.  The martinis are pretty delightful, especially the espresso and the mini martini.  2) Sunday Brunch. Starts at 10, doesn't get too busy until 12. It is an excellent alternative to the widely busy and popular Pamela's. Student brunch is a mere $10 and includes coffee. There are both breakfast (bacon, sausage, eggs, etc.) and lunch fare (pasta, subs, antipasti) offered.   Must-tries: frangelico french toast with blueberry banana sauce, tiramisu cups, and tortellacci with roasted red pepper sauce. It's all you can eat brunch buffet and worth every penny. The waitstaff on Sundays has always been great.   Be warned, there is not a separate breakfast menu. It's brunch or be limited to the other tasty food choices.  As for other times, Joe Mama's is okay. it is good to take family members who are paying for your food when they are visiting from out of town, as it is one of the only sit-down places in South Oakland that is family and palate friendly to all.    Joe Mama's lost me for a while when they got rid of Hug yo Belly Gemelli, but there are plenty of other satisfying items. If you want pizza, go to their sister restaurant Fuel n Fuddle a hop, skip, jump and away. They are very accommodating with pasta choices, as I  (along with many others) have asked for blush sauce or swapped a pasta type. Sure, it isn't the best Italian food place in the city, but the brunch and good memories of eating late night with friends there pushed me to give a 4 instead of a 3.
4	H8tJzQez27NrXi8BgMIVQ	George is a most gracious host and is very proud of his restaurant. I would highly recommend trying most anything on the menu but have had a recent favorite prepared to perfection...Peking Duck!!!  It was served as a first course but expertly prepared and cooked. Just the outer layer along with skin are served with the traditional pancakes and plum/hoison sauce. I recommend having the chef prepare duck fried rice with the extra duck meat not served.   George also has some excellent soups to try...but try everything. It's worth the trip.  Enjoy
2	wyz4iPM5piksfVvfRNfTw	I visited Maria Bonita last night I read the reviews some good n bad.  But I like to see for myself sometimes, I was disappointed. First  they were not busy when we arrived at all and we had to wait while they cleaned a table. That was okay, we sat upstairs, they told us that they had a big party upstairs and hadnt cleaned up yet!!  They cleaned a table for us and we were the only ones upstairs, through our whole meal they never cleaned any other tables!!!    I had the chicken Quesadilla, Queso dip, my friend ordered a margartia and the chicken Mole.  The margarita had to much salt and had more sweet n sour mix than tequila.  My Quesadilla was okay the sour cream that was suppost to come with it and guacamole was on top of some skippy lettece and some rice.  The chicken Mole was bland with no kick or flavor.  There were no drink specials or special dishes of the day.  As we were waiting for our bill my friend looked over and saw a check laying on the table beside of us of which still hadnt been cleaned gross.  The person had left their credit card we told our server so they could call the person or put it in their safe.  Now how long would that have sat there or what if a dishonest person sat there and took it!!  I was not impressed with Maria Bonita at all, nothing beats Don Pedros so far :)
2	q5MfoZBbMyKOQ65LLBPA	"Meh" is right, I'm not quite sure what people like about this place.  It's so below average that I have no clue what the attraction is.  I initially went to Atria's b/c of all the hype and then I realized something, it's all hype - there is no substance to the hype.  The food was blah, the atmosphere was blah, the service was blah.  Maybe "Meh" isn't the right word - let's go with "Blah" for Atria's.    There are so many places in and around Pittsburgh that are so much better so do yourself a favor and try one of those other places!
4	5cBSYqoWECng0bYuFZ8Ag	Rad, chrome and red, amazing prehistoric fish-tanked Oriental dining hall aesthetic. Large lazy susan full to overflowing with condiments (fish sauce! oil based chili that isn't as hot as it looks! etc) and utensils sitting in the middle of your table.   Decent selection of tofu entrees and apps, but the veggie pho is where it's at. Ever since our Viet-training-wheel event, I've been  semi-obsessed with vegetarian pho and have had it at a number of queen city mainstays - but Saigon's is best, has all the correct additions, and is almost the cheapest. So that's awesome.  Other than that, the menu is ok but less extravagant than BT's or LV's. Those guys set a high bar, and there it is. But as they do not have a vegetarian pho option, I will drive out here to order Saigon's. Happily.
2	VzxXjdQZsJiBStVkpZXRow	I'm not much of a blogger but, here's my first one. This was my first visit to China Ginger and it might be my last. The man at the counter was very nice a tried to help me make a decision. I was trying to not get anything fried with the exception of fried rice. My order was pork fried rice with NO CARROTS( not that I  don't like carrots), steamed dumplings, chicken and broccoli NO CARROTS, and free sesame balls for making an order over $20.00.  Complaint #1, There were carrots in everything I ordered without carrots. Complaint #2, Seems like the sauce for the chicken and broccoli and the sauce they use for the fried rice was just plain old soy sauce ( very lazy!). Complaint #3, The "free" sesame balls the threw in were flavorless, It was like biting into fried nothingness. The center was filled with something, I couldn't  make out what it was. I wasn't sure if it was fish paste, chocolate, or some kind of meat puree. I ate one and threw out the rest. What ever it was, it was just a waste, Complaint #4, The one main entr\u00e9e I order, which should have been enough for at least 3 to 4 normal portions( not over eater portions) was hardly enough for 2 people but too much for 1. Complaint #5 ( wow, I didn't think I would get to 5) The steamed dumpling looked and tasted like the were out of the frozen food section at Walmart. I don't think I have ever had worse dumplings than this in my life, And I've had some pretty bad dumplings. Btw. served with the same soy sauce as the fried rice and chicken and broccoli.  The positive, the guy who took my order was nice.   When I started to write this review I gave China Ginger 2 Stars. After reading what I wrote, I think one star is too much. I will not be going back
2	6VcD0r8mupmidnLj0kC4Ww	My wife and I are Vegas locals and Mexican food is a favourite. When South Point opened its new Mexican restaurant we had to give it a try, especially as it is only a short drive.  The first thing I noticed about Baja Miguel's is that it looks more like a cafe than a Mexican restaurant. The colours, decor and layout of the tables doesn't make for the most intimate setting.  Before our meal we were given Salsa, bean dip and guacamole. I can't comment on the guac since neither of us like it - The salsa was good but the bean dip was revolting.  I ordered the shredded beef nachos and my wife had cheese enchiladas.  The best way I can describe the food is "Pedestrian" - sort of like what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  The beef on my nachos was a bit sloppy and my wife described her food as "ok, but nothing id ever crave again".  In a city with so many cheap Mexican options, give Baja Miguel's a big miss. The food is OK, but when you have similarly cheap fare all over town, usually of much higher quality, I don't see any reason to go here again.  On the plus-side, drink service was sensational and the staff looked after us well.
4	YLkURKZR0iCg02N3oWNlw	I love finding little hidden gems while driving around. This little tiny place I found and so glad I tried them!  The service was great, considering my inconsiderate self strolled in 15 minutes before closing! :-/ (rude!) Anyhow-they were polite, food was great and never felt like I needed to inhale my food and go. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Soltani and it was made to perfection! Chicken was flavorful, nicely grilled, rice was fresh, overall just delicious! Good job to the owner and staff!
2	ysFDilVLGQuG70Ygh2BHA	Another in the long line of strip-mall restaurants that I seem to have a habit o visiting, this one is brand new, in the Harris Teeter shopping center that is wedged into the corner of Idlewild and Margaret Wallace roads near Matthews.  Frankly, I have always thought that those corners are a bad place for a large center such as this one, and after eating here, I feel so even more strongly than before.  Turning into the place isn't bad, whether you are turning right or turning left.  But getting out is another matter entirely - especially if you are turning left across traffic.  There is simply no way to get across both lanes easily, and it's right there at the intersection so it's unlikely to see any improvement any time soon.  When the building of the homes on each side finishes it will probably get worse.  In any case, the place isn't bad.  When you go in, it looks really small - just a counter.  But to the right, there is a medium-sized dining room that is a bit of a surprise.  It's actually quite nice for such a fast-food restaurant.  Usually it's lucky if you get a couple of chairs and an old table.  This one's nicer.  The food comes out on actual dishes with silverware, too - no throwaway serving utensils and plates.  I was impressed.  Very rarely will such a place give you the royal treatment like this.  The food had to be good.  Or they were covering something up.  In fact, it was probably a little of both.  It's not that the food was bad.  It just wasn't that great.  The sauce was a bit on the heavy side.  Had it not been, the food may have been quite good, but as it was, the taste was simply lost.  The service wasn't bad, but being over on the side of the counter like that, it's like you had been stuck in another world and simply forgotten.  Since the food took a while, this was disturbing as well.  Not my favorite place.
2	tibCeu86FRHWhUPbDbXhA	Since it's close to the house, I thought I'd give this place a try.  Tried an Angus burger and the wife had the sliders.  The food was in a word mediocre.  I've had much better burgers in a lot of places that made lots of other things besides burger.  The sliders were pretty bad with thin tasteless meat.  The prices are high as well.  Oh well, on to the next joint. Only if Delux could branch out to Chandler...
4	Zi6KcncWb2CzK23nU7Djpg	Downstairs!  The entrance is on the right side of the chicken joint above it.  What a wacky little bar!  And they have friendly people that are just as weird as you are.  Great place for conversing with patrons, the bartender or just hanging out.  Dare I say this is the first true dive bar I've discovered in Charlotte.  You "could" dance in here if it wasn't so tiny.  It gets packed quick and then nobody can move.  I've noticed locals confusing dive bars with biker bars.  Both have their merits but  they are not the same!  Dive bars are cheap, have their own regulars and have been around forever.  Many are former speakeasies.  In the surliest of places, the bartenders drink as much as the patrons.  That's not the case at Jeff's because they run a respectable establishment.   Oh right, and biker bars have a bunch of hogs parked outside and bikers drinking inside.  Get it?!  It's pretty simple.   Where the two lifestyles sometimes intersect is at joints that refer to themselves as punk rock or heavy metal bars.  And I haven't found one of those in Charlotte just yet, but I'm still looking...
4	YTVZsNjwvzZV03AuynQaA	Surprisingly, Ethiopian food consists of more than 6 grains of rice and a few beans.  If you're a vegetarian like me or a vegan, this place will be a sanctuary for you, especially if you try their vegan tiramisu.  It's right across the street from the Tempe Improv, so stop by here for a very inexpensive, very tasty dinner.  Do not, however, make the mistake I did -- the injeera bread is not a napkin.
4	yIRox5fnY3oYe5RqywZTVw	I've been here a few times and think the bagels are very good but I'm not a huge fan of the coffee and their sandwiches.  I suggest you pick up some everything bagels. So good.   Employees are super friendly and recognize the regulars without issue.  Prices are great, you really can't beat 'em. You won't find another bagel place around here at these prices.
2	sg2uQQykd8WlNekAqd6cmQ	Well I live down the street from this place. And I hate coming to it. First reason; drink specials. Or may I say the lack there of. For women they have some pretty good specials but for us men I think this place figures since all the servers are in school girl outfits they are doing us a favor. Honestly I careless about the servers and what they wear. It's no strip club. I come there for one reason only, a beer. And when it's over priced it's not worth it. The food at this joint is also crappy, only the french fries are ok. I recommend going to Salty Senoritas if your looking for a good bar  & food and atmosphere right down the street.
4	hT9PE5ZeCxtHlgaYZfBRw	The food is above average, but it is not especially innovative or creative.  They use quality ingredients in standard combinations for a tasty product.  The tuna tartare was a standout, I had a venison special that was merely good. The waiter couldn't answer a few questions about the food and went to check for me.  I generally expect a little more familiarity with the food at "upscale" places.   You are definitely being upcharged for the view and the setting - but for a special dinner, it is worth it, because the view and setting are pretty killer. Stop by the Jade bar before or after dinner - it is my fave place in AZ for drinks.
4	DH6v6Xm8iiSJIg3XHhJAsw	I enjoyed my lunch there yesterday and craved the same sandwich just 2 hours later. The peppercorn steak on white was amazing as usual along with my chicken bacon salad. As we sat and ate we both agreed it was by far, better than a Subway sandwich and it was all about the bread! The gals there were very attentive and sweet, great customer service. Will be back!
4	HTIM5HlFR8uHjBYoQdYO0g	For many months I had savored the food of Jamerica strictly from their library mall cart; a few weeks back though I made it into the restaurant and as with the cart I can't wait to go back.  It was a Saturday afternoon, me and the lady were the only two patrons, though there were a bunch of guys playing dominoes and drinking beer in the back room.  There was reggae on the speakers and Redstripes all around.  Service was quick and friendly and the food was great.  Large portions and super tasty.  So glad I live close.
4	27M4q01s1Q9O8JI53xzfyw	I fell for this restaurant immediately, and I do mean fell for as soon as I stepped one foot out of my car I went immediately face down on the ice.  Now just because it begins bad does not mean it ends bad.  Once my fiancee knew I was all right and subsequently she stopped laughing, we went in and enjoyed a really great experience.  This was my first time at Feiler's and I could tell right away I'd go back again.  The decor is very chic Ala That 70's Show.    We started with a round of beer for me and brandy old fashion for her.  It was Friday night so we of course ordered the Friday night Fish fry, which for both of us meant beer battered perch and hash browns though cod was also an option.  I was disappointed to later find out they have walleye on their regular menu as that is my favorite and preferred fish but none the less, the perch was excellent.  Crisp and not too fishy with a good portion, the perch was just right.  The hash browns were more like small cut potatoes and were not crisp and well done.  I did, however, take them home and cooked them up proper the next morning and they were great.  Overall, I would say that Feiler's is a neat little neighborhood treat tucked in the nowhere land near the beltline.  It will take you back in time for certain and though prices are from the 70's, it won't set your wallet back either.  Good value for the price and we'll definitely keep it on our list!
4	13hEpFRpsteqUSoY9IvQ	The Honey BBQ wongs are the best here but I always call my odrder in and go pick it up as the wait is LONG lol..the service sucks waitresses are trashy and the place is usually not that clean but those wongs keep me coming back time after time..
2	mQhjLYXSvfRmf8TfnXQSGw	Service at this restaurant was excellent. Always asked to refill drinks and offered to take away plates often. When seated, immediately asked for what drinks we wanted.  Food at this buffet was on the low quality side, Sushi had a lot of fillers. Food was average to poor. Ice cream was all messy, melted and not very clean.  Beware of the coupons, although you save, the food is very cheaply made.
4	xXIFkcW94YRI1pLNsWQcw	We had a light dinner there on a weeknight and were seated immediately. The atmosphere was dark, warm and romantic; the wall paintings and decor reminded me of the Italian Village in Chicago (http://www.italianvillage-chicago.com/).  We both enjoyed the food--I had the market tomato and goat cheese pizza, and my fianc\u00e9e had the margherita pizza. The crust was crisp and the food was simple but flavorful.
2	GJ7rGnza0a9iYRMevStQ	Here is the thing, the food was mediocre at best. The meat in the cheese steak was to thick and over done along with the mushrooms and onions. I kind of felt like I was eating dog food or a really bad Italian beef. The only good part were the fries and they were just OK. If you want a good cheese steak I suggest you go to Casella's in Scottsdale. I wish I had.
4	a11KoOgODLrLWSJqK7muxQ	Sweet basil, this place is good!! :-)  I think that's going to be my new "catch phrase"..."Sweet Basil", etc.:)  If I want to add emphasis, I can insert an adjective..."Sweet Aromatic Basil", etc.:)  What do you think?...No?...OK:)  But, Maxim still has about the best Vietnamese food around:)  After a workout this morning (to nullify the effects of the UYE at Haus Murphy's last night) I met a bunch of my attorney buddies for a sort of healthy lunch today (BTW, I realize, that sounds like an oxymoron..."attorney buddies", not "healthy lunch":)  They are a jolly crew...always laughing and giggling about the misery visited upon the rest of society by the legal profession and its handmaidens, health care and insurance:)  We laughed and talked and ate, ate and laughed...soon, very soon,  karma will pay a visit, but for now, they are jolly and entertaining lunch companions (not to mention invaluable resources for that inevitable day when my own legal misery strikes-:)  Maxim is more reliable than an attorneys billing logs (and significantly more tasty and less expensive:)  I generally have #20, the rare beef pho with rice noodles, and a chicken spring roll...hearty broth, real beef (not bits and pieces:) and plenty of it:)  Add your own heat (and there are plenty of options for that) as well as sprouts, basil, peppers, etc., and you've engineered a pretty decent lunch...that doesn't cause retox...probably:)  The service is always good here (insert legal joke about "service" here)...and to top it off, the whole crew at Maxim are just very nice people...I think they are mostly family and they treat all of their customers great!...We were greeted with a smile and a smile and wave when we left:-)  Sweet Basil, that's good food:-)
4	GoNOlg56R2BqNDnpjH9lg	Such a yummy alternative to fried southern food. We found this place from an article we read about them in the paper.  Our reaction: a NY style deli in Charlotte ... we are so there!  We went to try it that day and were not disappointed. This place is decked out in top to bottom New York City memorabilia (even has autographed Seinfeld pics, not sure if they are real though).  Pickles and coleslaw to start off the Corned Beef sandwich on rye meal.  This place is packed on the weekends so expect to wait or take it to go.
4	YbZ1oIapAr4VpRBPIPoww	We first ate here a few months ago.  The pasta and veal dishes were OK, but not spectacular.  Then last night I had a really strong craving for pizza.  But except for Settebello (which does a very crispy crust with minimal toppings), we have hated all the local pizza places, especially the chains.  I remembered that Buon Gusto also made pizza, so I called in an order of our traditional toppings:  sausage, mushrooms, and onions.  Oh, my goodness, did that HIT THE SPOT.  The crust was New York style (thin, but chewy) and the toppings were REAL.  Yes, Virgina, someone makes a pizza here in suburbia that is not canned and processed.  The pizza sauce was fresh, but not overwhelming.  And we were eating this pie after a 15 minute trip in the car!  I imagine that eating it inhouse (as we prefer to eat all our pizzas) can only be better.  I have to stop talking about this now or I will want to order another one right away.
4	tEtEr9coD6xxWGvxQYM0iA	The breakfast we get delivered & it's the BOMB!!!!! I wasn't as impressed with their lunch, but it was filling & they deliver which is fantastic!!!!! We order so much that they put in extras which I thought was really nice.  The people are fantastic to work with.  They go the extra mile!  Thank you Lord for PPR!!!!!!!  BTW the sausage & cheese omlet is even better than the one I make & love!!!
2	nto0a0U7Twg3ylEI6PYVGg	I had very high expecations for Good Food. I have been a longtime fan of Bruce Barrington's and it's such a hotspot. I agree with Courtney- the decor was definitely urban and chic and I loved it. It reminded me of a Denver vibe, and I liked the layout and ability to see the kitchen and prep areas.    But alas, the food left a bit to be desired. I had the gnocchetti, which the waitress said was the #1 thing on the menu. I was encouraged by the use of brussel sprouts but the taste of the sauce just was a little funky, too heavy and it was over-parmesaned.  We also had the braised short rib and the quality and texture of meat reminded me of the kind you'd find in Progresso soup. The ginger dressing on the salad was a bit bitter and the falafel was forgettable and a bit mushy in the middle.  The only dish we enjoyed were the wild mushrooms- delicious!  In the end, we walked away quite disappointed and not even hopeful enough that we would get a decent dessert so we skipped it, which we NEVER do.   I'm disappointed to give a bad review. :( For the money, I'd go across the street to Andrew Blair's. I guess I just need to go back to Barringtons for the real deal.
4	NMoRcZTRL9Iqj9DRmzzmPw	Love it! I've been here numerous times for fresh-made sandwiches and sides.  Everything is fresh. It's a little pricey for a deli, but the sandwiches are so big I can order just a half sandwich. Love to give this place business instead of a chain. In cooler weather, their soups are usually very good.
2	1TY4XwHhXOy9IYnCFY1rFg	After a LOSING weekend, I couldn't wait to get out of Vegas.  Traffic at 2:00pm on Sunday of the Thanksgiving weekend was horrendous!  I've left many times in the past on Sundays at 2:00pm and have not had any problem.  We decided to have lunch before driving out again.  DJK was actually on my bookmarks to try, so we came.      I ordered the Soft Tofu with Seafood for $9.99 (2 stars).  Right away, something didn't look right - it was not bubbling, bubbling hot that is!  I have NEVER had any soft tofu that was brought to the table not boiling hot with bubbles.  The soup looked really red but it was not spicy at all.  Not only that, it was really bland.  I had to add rock salt to it!!!  My fiance ordered the Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap for $14.99 (2 stars).  It was dry and and boring.  The veggies were unimpressive and you couldn't even find bits of beef that were supposed to be in it.  My fiance asked me 'Didn't I order the Beef Bibimbap?  But where is the beef?'.  He had to add more soy sauce and the chili miso paste a few times to season it.      There were only 5 banchans.  I noticed the other tables (they were obviously Korean) had more than us, like a plate of salad.  I hate it when I go to a Korean restaurant and being treated inferior because I am not Korean.  And whatever it is, this 'discrimination' only occurs at Korean restaurants, not at other Asian restaurants!  For this reason, I'm giving the service 3 stars even though they were pretty friendly.    Unless I am dying of craving for Korean food in Vegas, I doubt it I'd ever return!
4	dsEuHryAAmA4XzhTDDUzYQ	Open 24 hours a day. Very cheap and they have great breakfast specials. So be prepared to be surrounded by senior citizens!  It's a down home cooking kinda place where you get what you pay for. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. We've only been for breakfast and have always left full and happy.  My only complaint is that their coffee leaves something to be desired.
4	Y3GL3cDkhLnDR6HDktHng	If you are looking for great authentic style pizza, wings, and subs, come and enjoy a warm family oriented restaurant in the heart of Phoenix.  Are you tired of the artificiality of the popular food chains, come and enjoy a unique experience at Angie and Jimmy's.  The pizza and wings is the hot commodity, due to taste and daily specials, yet Angie and Jimmy's also provide a variety of authentic subs.  The interior design is layered with precious Elvis artifacts, which is the reason why some people come in and dine in the first place.  Once there however, it is hard to not fall in love with anything and everything you eat.  Yet, if you can't make it to the restaurant, Angie and Jimmy's cater to parties and local events.  So if you can't enjoy the fun from the inside, Angie and Jimmy's lets you take it outside.
2	oUWuseNa2G4Dk9Li3DX0g	We've been here a few times.  We really love the sushi, but the service seems to get worse every time.  This last time, we waited for 30 minutes after we finished just to get the check.  I asked for it three times and after the third time the waiter just never came back.  We finally walked to the hostess station to pay.  I will definitely get take out, but will no longer dine in.
4	jLgZQ5XPQROD92zT5065gQ	This place is great! I wish I would of went here when I lived closer to the place. But it was worth the drive.  Had some great appetizers and wine with some friends AND it was happy hour so the appetizers and wine were half off!  I was psyched to see when the hummus came out it was served with a roasted head of garlic! I love roasted garlic! The hummus was amazing, by far the best hummus I've had in the valley. It may be too garlic-y for some but I loved it. The portobello mushroom with crab was also pretty tasty and amazing. It was grilled to perfection (not dry!) and some crab mixture was put atop. It was just so good! The baked brie was so-so. I've had better store bought. My friend, the lone meat eater, had wings. And judging from his hand and face after, they must of been pretty good! It was a great spot for a fun get together with friends. They even had a live band playing, for those that like live music.  I will be back soon!
4	lDs5DKJXaA9HxFNU4TCX2w	Good general tso chicken, could provide more sauce, crab ragoon is very good.  I do like the hot and sour soup, one of the best in area.  Egg rolls are good, but not great.  That is why only 4 stars.
2	1OsrCY3B44YK19bPcONTLQ	Urgh, went there for a quick dinner, having read decent reviews here but despite fairly good service, the food was really not great.  I had pasta in a weak, watery tomato based sauce, my company had a fairly average lasagne.  On the plus side this place was fairly cheap but, as with most things, you get what you pay for.  Try Gusto on George Street for a superior (an more expensive!) Italian experience.
4	lIWWnN7vGUSskj48oiX9CA	King & I has one of the best yellow currys & Pad thai i've ever had. Full of vegetables & super tasty and love the spice! On a trip to Vegas, I took my hubby to try it and he absolutely loved it too! He thinks it's the best thai food he's had... though, he's only been to maybe 3 or 4 different Thai places... but still, a place we'll eat every time we go to Vegas!
4	ODwNyToeV2iNkyITRaA	I can't tell you if this is really the original, or just the original one owned by Tony, but I can tell ya it's pretty darn good.  Huge menu.  And of course not just Burgers.  Steak sandwiches, as well at Fish, Ham and even tuna salad.  Or go with Burritos, Gyros or Pita Sandwiches.  And yes, that is a NY Steak on their menu.   But don't forget your appetizers - Chili Fries, Mozzarella sticks and Fried Zucchini.  Sheesh!  And their fries are SO good!  Really huge portions too.  Especially for the price.  Expect to pay about $6 for lunch.  Yea, you're just going to sit on McDonald's style tables, but you didn't come here for the atmosphere did ya?  So far everything I've had here is really good.  Even the gyros my friend got weren't too bad, though they weren't freshly cut.  Think "Steak-ums" with chunks of Gyro meat.    Important note - While yes, you can use your debit card, their process basically works like an ATM Machine.  Order comes out to $12 - they will run it for $20 and give you back your change.  AND - it's a $1.50 fee to use it.  Plan to just bring your cash.
2	GfguBLTGqORdURC9mWVWw	My family and I used to always go to the Green Valley Brooklyn Bagel. This one is not worthy of the convenience. We were served moldy cheese and when we brought it back we were not offered a refund. EW!
4	q4Rk7clGEHrAloEoLVoKw	Happy Hour & Late Nights are the way to go. Good pricing on App's and Foxie pours em stiff. Ladies, make sure to ask Foxie for the time on his 'Magic Watch'.  Sunday Nights, Musicians from all over come and sit in with Tommy and play until everyone is nice and primed. Always a good time on Sunday Nights.
2	dGvvlPNVWJkulTIEEawxA	We went here because we have a buy 1 get one pizza free from the Entertainment book.  They informed us we could not use the coupon, even though it said their address on it.  We went ahead and ordered there. We got a large sausage and pepperoni pizza. First impression was the large was small. It was thin crust, which was not too bad. They do not put very much sauce on the pizza and I love sauce so I was disappointed.  Also, each square of pizza had 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 ball of sausage. I prefer my sausage in little ground up pieces and these were the size of mini meatballs, so I ended up taking off the sausage. I probably wouldn't go here again especially since 1 pizza was over 20 bucks.
4	lPjiFWAVhm41NHI14ChTw	NOMNOMNOM!!!! WOW what a great sandwich! Loved the turkey with cranberry sauce. yummy! These places are a chain and they are all over town, but the food and concept are holding up. The sandwiches are big and there are a few chairs sometimes in these places. Not fancy at all but really really good!
4	ze463v4XISk5VRtk883CkA	One of the best cheeseburgers in town can be found at the "Wisco".  There's a pool table, dart board and volleyball out back. The drinks are poured generously, and there is often a really cheap beer special going on.
4	OvwWTeHskkXvS8AlINtJ4A	Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!
4	WjdxZn9l9ZbPE8nuj3g	I love wings, absolutely love them... and you can tell how much i love them by my pictures... anyways, Santisi has awesome wings..  The atmosphere can be a bit creepy at times and pretty dark, they have ton of TV's all tuned towards some sort of sport or game. Usually there is a lot of seating unless their is some sort of big game going on or its Friday night.   The food there is awesome.. Great/awesome wings, the ribs there rock, the pizza is awesome too. The beer prices are good, and i reasonable. The waitresses are mostly hot, and really nice. Out of the 20+ times I've only had one "interesting experience" there (and no it didn't involve little people).  I would definitely recommend this place.  One note. Although it's a kid friendly bar, i wouldn't recommend bringing your kid there.
4	4zWQ4g3kRzUyXDAGlGkraA	Located in the Safeway shopping center on the northeast corner of Scottsdale & Pinnacle Peak, this Jade Palace may seem far for some of you, but for some of us living in North Phoenix / Scottsdale, it's the best Chinese around!  Jade Palace is a regular in my rotation of consistent dine-in and take-out restaurants and has been for years.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the service is attentive.  The hostesses are always sweet and if you place a take-out order, they make sure that they read your order back to you to avoid any confusion.  My favorite dishes are the healthy choice steamed shrimp (or chicken) and veggies, mu shu chicken, and dry sauteed string bean.  Their soups are all really good as well.  The saying 'never order fish in a Chinese Restaurant' does not hold true at Jade Palace - go for it... it's delicious!  Devlan, the Manager & Co-owner, can often be found at this location and he is extremely personable and makes sure that all of his customers have a pleasant experience... Whether I'm coming from the gym in workout clothes or I'm dressed from work, dining solo or with a group, I always feel welcome at Jade Palace.  For the food and the service, this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you like Chinese food, check out Jade Palace - I'll see you there!
2	nB62qYyHb0fH7RGw9YlPA	Not a fan.  The paella was not very good. It was wet and overly salted. It needed more saffron or other spices.  They made us come at 6 - early - but didn't even take our wine order until 6.45 and we didn't get our wine until 7.15. It was unreal. The place was basically empty at 7, so I have no clue why they insisted we come at 6. The service was borderline humorous, but if I wasn't on vacation I probably would have gone insane or just left.   Also felt very touristy and didn't seem like there were many locals there. Maybe just my impression, but we really didn't like this place.
4	nfxLl86rOaWiNAOBlmsbbw	Super Bowl Sunday. I'm in a strange town and I want to watch the game. My indecision about where to go was quickly decided for me by my concierge who pointed me toward Zipps.   I got there with plenty of time to spare and was greeted at the door by the nicest guy who was very accommodating to make sure I had a seat. He offered me outdoors (too bright to see the TV's) , inside (the stool was higher than the table- not good for long periods of sitting) or at the bar (Perfect).   After getting though my Goldilocks phase, I settled in at the bar and got some great service from Shauna, the bartender who never lost her smile no matter how many directions she was being pulled in. In fact- she is the reason for the 4th star as she made me right at home at her bar from the first beer ordered. And there was none of that "catering to the men" thing that makes me nuts when the bartender is a cute female. She was on her game for all!   Plenty of TV's in this place.  Three alone over the bar, more outside and even more scattered through out the bar.  There is also a pool table and other bar games.  The food was just okay. I had a burger which came with a novel idea of half and half fries and onion rings. The food came up fast and hit the spot but it wasn't anything special. The fries were soggy and the onion rings were over done but the burger was pretty good with the meat seasoned perfectly. The menu is quite diverse, though, ranging from burgers to pizza to salads.   Nice clientele too. I had read some Yelp reviews about what kind of person frequents this place but I have to say- there was a good mix of tourists and locals and if the two guys sitting by me were any indication of people who normally frequent this place- I'd go back if I lived in the area (but maybe it was a different crowd given it was Superbowl Sunday) as they were friendly and fun to hang with for the afternoon.   Yay Zipps! You made my Super Bowl Sunday fun versus sitting at a hotel bar. And that's saying alot.
4	7DEEDhkUPEOA7z47uiuo3A	First, what's with the other reviewers whining about the location?  The metropolitan area does go beyond their cozy little caves in the east valley!  Moving on...hey look it's a non-chain place to eat in the Phoenix area -- AMAZING!  The food was excellent, the service was great, it wasn't overly crowded (i.e. no long wait), and it wasn't one of those pretentious "we're a cool Italian over priced fancy place."  It was the perfect place to get good food, relax and have a great time.  Something the west valley definitely has going over the east!
2	9V9sySFGaiWicicUUJSUKQ	Eh, pretty decent eatery. Reasonable price and portion but the food isn't anything to write home about. Portions are filling but I found the flavor of the chicken and broccoli to be a bit bland. Stay away from the bubble tea though, very very bad but the smoothies are drinkable. Sushi here is OK but with Sushi Boat two doors down I wouldn't recommend it. There are not many tables so the place is commonly full.
2	GV61MFTHRfldL9nw77H0g	Not really a great experience..  Arrived at about 6pm and was told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  Ended up being 40 minutes to get a seat.  Normally I wouldn't wait for a place like this, but we had gift cards to use.  We finally got seated in the bar area.. after which there was a bit of confusion on who our server was as 2 people stopped by.. and I think they told each other that they were going to be the one for our table because then nobody really came back and we had to flag one of them down to start drink orders.    Drinks took a few minutes.. and then we waited another 10-15 minutes for someone to come back to actually take the dinner order.. again we had to flag someone down.  Had to ask for bread at this point.. getting hungry(er).. Salads didn't take too long to get out, but it took another 20 minutes after those were long gone to get the main course out.    So the food... I got the ribs and chicken with fries.  The ribs were tough.. I had a real hard time even cutting thru them with a knife.  The chicken was dry and the fries were soggy and luke warm at best.  Plus the food just LOOKED like boring/bland when it got to the table.  Everyone else at the table got some sort of steak.. those seemed serviceable, but nothing spectacular.. but again.. bland looking.    So the problems with the service.. I think they were just understaffed and I can't blame the waitstaff that was there as it looked like they were doing their very best... I know that's a tough job, especially when understaffed.  The food.. was just not good.  In this 2+ hour experience, I would not recommend much... Although I was not drinking, the people I was with said the drinks were good.. strong.. So I guess that's a positive.
2	eqyXzuhS8f9pnrcvD0EAA	Standard burger, good fries, okay service.  Tried out this place a few weeks ago. My parents and I did the Build Your Own Burger, which allows you to choose your toppings and sauces. I had the black agnus beef on whole wheat with onions, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle mayo. The chipotle mayo sauce was great, and the sweet potato fries were decent. The burger was nothing to rave about (although my dad said the kobe beef burger was pretty good). For the price and the quality, I'd look elsewhere.  We typically go to LushBurger on Pima near DC Ranch. Gave this place a shot, but I think we'll stick with LushBurger.
4	wMukYDHvWpXGuCOlLazw	This McDonald's obviously isn't getting 4 stars because of its food, because based on food alone, McDonald's is a 3 star at best and I get that.  This McDonald's is a 4 star because of their employees and overall service. Even when they get busy, they have rarely messed up my order. The one time I recall them getting my order wrong, they were quick to fix it, and did not even try to give me any grief about how it was some how my fault.  The inside, bathroom, and even the kids play area are cleaner then the majority of other McDonald's I have been to.  Who ever is running this place and doing the hiring is doing a good job.
2	HxbQKZkNdOyobODl3ZbTA	This is the old standby for my work. Any time we order pizza it's from here. I'm not a fan personally. Too greasy (I understand pizza is meant to be greesy, but really??) and the sauce seems like it adds sugar and is just plain too sweet for my tastes.   I like my pizza plain. Cheese, that's it; however work orders this "Pittsburgh pizza" which is quite interesting. Very primanti's like, so if you are in the mood for an adventure you should try it.
2	Navh6BOoKy6eYPucTUaenA	You know I'm not a fan of the basic burger joint.  They would typically get 1 star from me.  However D&B have some fresh food. The problem I have with the fresh food is how its bombarded with the less healthy stuff.  Course if you're looking for a burger joint, this is your place.
2	fFGD878OLEmcz5xxHyXuFg	A "build a taco" style place tha i s always full of a larger than average number of sports-obsessed folks and only an average (or less than average) number of extremely high people.  This is counter to my expectations, given the "Chronic" portion of the name.  However, they so reliably live up to the "Taco" portion of the moniker.  Bsed on my, primarily lunch time experiences, I have made the following conclusions:  They offer a drink special during ASU games.  The fish taco is okay, as is the potato taco.  Is this the best place on Mill Avenue?  No.  Is it better than Taco Bell?  Yes.  Is it a pretty good deal?  Also a yes.
2	yJORbIQg1vgJ230u3mJUiQ	Took my wife there for Valentines day, and was fairly disappointed. I have visited other Brazilian steakhouses before so I had an idea of what to expect, unfortunately this place did not meet my expectations.  The food was fairly good, the bacon wrapped scallops were terrific. They are also attached to an Indian Restaurant, so you are able to sample from the Indian food, which was pretty good.  The service and selection was the disappointing part. They only brought out like 4 or 5 types of meat to try, and the selection on the hot bar was pretty thin.  Next time I will go to Chima...
2	ewyF7EOnTlDNGoirRkAOA	NO CHICKEN PRODUCTS. Seriously, in this day and age?  I drove by this place hundreds of times, thinking it sounded pretty cool, and the other day finally bit the bullet and went inside. Put bluntly, there just isn't much of a reason to go back.   I had no problems with the service or the speed at which we got our food, so I can at least list that as a positive for this place.   But their menu lacks any real variety. Sadly, the place is essentially a poor man's In-N-Out Burger, and they share In-N-Out's biggest flaw - a lack of any chicken products. Not everyone likes burgers and hot dogs, and you sure as hell can't make a meal out of just fries. In their defense, the place also had a breakfast menu, but they weren't serving it all day so that sort of defeats the purpose.   The big gimmick behind this place is they like to put chili on everything.... but seriously, can you run a whole restaurant around this premise?  Disappointingly, the shakes are standard fast food fare, themselves being similar to In-N-Out. If I go into a retro-style restaurant, I want a quality 50s diner-style malt, not the crap I can go down the street to McDonalds and get.  If this place would add chicken products to their menu they would score some major points in my book.... but I somehow doubt that will happen anytime soon.
2	zP1MttmJMKpd8d7Aeng	I've eaten at the Flancers in Gilbert three times and recently tried this one in Mesa. I'm just not a big fan, the reason I kept going back is because its close to home and because of the rave reviews.  I figured I must be missing something. This last time I asked the server what was the best thing on the menu, she replied about a roast beef sandwich, really it was just OK and the same with my wife's salad, nothing special. Really I much prefer Crackers for sandwiches and Vito's for pizza.
4	WHXOnLKKeqfiAkmReWRqJQ	Great spot for breakfast or lunch in downtown Mesa. The food is above average, and the pricing very reasonable. I eat here about once a week (close to work). I would pick a local place like this over Denny's, Coco's and the like any day. They offer unique off-menu specials like: grandma's meatloaf, spinach quiche, and blueberry pancakes almost every day.  No waiting, the place is somewhat large and never too crowded. Has the look and feel of a mid-western breakfast spot.  The staff are very polite and helpful, and they get to know you by name.
4	mFwiOfhKwao3cOVHL1wSw	The first time I went here was for a going away for a co-worker. It was pretty good, and the service was great. Waitress was extremely nice and helpful. The food was tasty, and it made me want to go back for more. The place isn't located in the best location, but at least the food and service are good. :)
4	8KCnY3Yn0Yiz2E4Zy8Jzw	Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My "Artichoke dip" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My 'eggless eggrolss" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area.
4	zBYRuwtgUxz0Z5Ki8AbQ	I've eaten in here 2-3 times and did "Carside to go" twice.  No matter how I've eaten here - it has always been a solid experience.  The carside to go deal is awesome.  They see your car pull in and bring it right out.  The staff on the phone is friendly when they take your order, the staff in person has always been very accommodating and they don't do the "eye roll" when I ask for a booth.  I just moved to this side of the valley from the west side and, let me tell you, if you think anything negative about this Applebee's - try to eat at one on the west side (yech).  Favorites:  The new wedge salad, the pretzels with beer cheese, and the potato twisters.  (I am a real health nut.)  Also, if you haven't tried a Perfect with extra olives, you're missing out.
2	BvOGbnAWwdFiODxpumcwSw	Regrettably I'm going to have to knock some stars off Mantra Masala as I feel like the quality and value for money is dropping off sharply.  This place has never been our favourite Indian option as far as flavour goes, but for a local place where we can get some takeout it more than fit the bill.  Unfortunately, on our last couple of visits the naan has been extremely rubbery and we've felt like they have really skimped on the content of our dishes that we ordered. Our Shahi Paneer on the most recent occasion contained a mere FIVE chunks of paneer in a sea of sauce. Sorry guys, but when you're charging slightly higher prices than average for your entree portions already, I expect more than 5 cubes of cheese for my money. On our previous visit we fared a little better, with seven bits, but it's still not very much is it?   Mantra Masala's food is generally OK, perhaps not quite as tasty as some of our favourites, but in terms of value they are going downhill fast, to a point that not even their proximity to my home will call me back.
2	T72Bg8sngpU6xCC7OXLhYg	Now two stars...  Went this past weekend for lunch and enjoyed the patio.  Nice to be outside, but they need more tables that accommodate more than 2 people.  Also, the queueing system is still a nightmare.  Still confusing.  Plus our food took a long time to come out...  Another thing I didn't like was that when I was getting silverware, I looked at the spoons and there was one with a big chunk of lettuce/spinach on it.  Gross.  If the food wasn't good and they didn't keep sending me two-for-one coupons, I wouldn't go here...
2	UmfuSc91O2IesIXxPwayMA	The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.
4	6CafHKSyFm5jXVerfXMkzQ	They shortened the happy hours at these bars, so happy hour is actually almost an actual hour now. More corporate greed at work. They did have a few beer specials, like 5 buck tall bud lights,  so that made it workable. Ordered the bikini wrap which was pretty good for a wrap. White chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Choice of wrap like spinach would have been nice. The fresh Cole slaw almost stole the show...The cook must have cut it up after I ordered. Best slaw in awhile. Good switch from fries. Not a bad location. Good living room area which I had all to my lonesome watching game.
4	PqEQ9JEd7biI9Tulw4oY2w	After months of commercials about that brisket swimming in my head, it was time to venture into an Arby's for the first time in decades. Hey, they smoke the meat  for 13 hours, so it had a good chance to taste good, if that was correct. The three Zipparita's I had right before entering might have earned the sandwich a fourth star, but I really investigated this sandwich. I opened it up, picked some brisket off, looked for fat, but did not find anything out of the ordinary and I'm a damn picky brisket dude. Of course, this won't ever rise to the level of a real smoke the brisket in-house place, but it was lean, had good flavor and the sandwich was well executed with a good amount of product. The smoked gouda was a great touch and the mayo/bbq sauce combo worked well. Onion straws on the sandwich also was a surprising touch. If you need a quick fix for Brisket, it is worth a try while supplies last.
2	Bivgb2LTQ4Rbhg4u5muKNQ	As an Eastsider, I'm always looking for a great spot for food and drinks close to home.  I was hoping that the Jovian Taphaus would deliver, but unfortunately it fell flat.  The restaurant/sports bar itself is still welcoming and comfortable, and the gorgeous view hasn't changed.  Unlike previous experiences at Cloude 9, our service was great and the beer selection was decent.  But the food disappointed.   We sat at the bar and ordered the mac and cheese, short rib sliders, and fried pickles.    The pasta in the mac and cheese was overdone and mushy.  Normally I love bacon, and think it's probably the greatest invention ever, but it completely overpowered the dish to the point that I wondered if the sauce on the mac and cheese actually contained cheese.  Because I certainly couldn't taste any.  The fried pickles were abysmal.  I love, love, love a good fried pickle, and I think that in order to do them well, you have to start with ice cold thickly sliced pickles so they retain their firmness and crunch through the deep frying.  Unfortunately, these pickles were thin and limp, and so encased in batter that you had to hunt to actually find the pickle.  Plus they were greasy as heck.  We took the leftovers home in a doggy bag for our dogs, and they didn't even like the deep fried pickles.    The short rib sliders were easily the best dish of the night.  And by best, I'd say average.  They were fundamentally okay - tender shredded short ribs on a nice brioche bun.  But they could have benefited from some oomph - maybe a bolder aioli or at least more of it.    If you like bland "upscale" bar food along the lines of your local TGI Friday's or Applebee's, then you'll probably find Jovian Taphaus to your liking.  But if you're hoping for something that's actually delicious and not just meh, you'll be very disappointed.
4	or4IXdj6jlY8vODeZ0kmg	The food here is awesome, lots of variety and inventive rolls and salads. I love the screaming orgasm. It's been around for a while and it's definitely high up on the list of best sushi in Vegas. It's a pretty huge place with a large sushi bar, tables and private booths as well, not as cozy as I prefer, but it does have that rowdy vibe that some of my favourite California places have. The sushi chefs usually end up pretty smashed by the end of the night, which makes things fun.
4	G9wBBqiu6op90GZozaguw	This place is good. Really good, actually. It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the "no students in the bathroom" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better. And that's not a bad thing.
4	8t0bQlptu3F2KVjqPNEVQ	I actually really love the food here. Prices are very good for what you get. The only thing is the place looks like a hoarder house. It hasn't changed since in the 80's except got more bumper stickers. When you look at this place it really makes you want to go somewhere else. I really hope the owner realizes soon what a dump and out-dated place it is and does something cause I would be sad if it were to close.

Walking in everything looked dirty- walls, booths- kinda cramped together. The service was good and super fast, we had our food within minutes. The downside was that everything tasted old. The chips tasted like old grease, the guac was brownish, and the tortilla from my chimichanga tasted like Mission brand.  I've had better at Filibertos. The worst part is they charge an extra $3 for beans and rice.  Hello! Beans and rice is a staple not a surcharge!
2	g1GjFP2XLo2RElBxC0s0w	Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm.
4	7mKtHRXfUl6EXly43fm4rg	I would never confuse good Asian, Thai, Chinese, Korean or Japanese food with Noodles...but if you're hungry and looking for something filling and delicious, this will fill the bill.  Yes, its a chain, yes, there are better choices, but for the money, Noodles will fill you up and put a smile on...well, it will fill you up.
2	pk4NEMcORiTKIu175E23rw	Foods alright, not impressed by there pizza but not much else for a quick bite on this corner except the market next door.  Honestly there roller pizzas might be better at this time of the day.  The man that served my order was pretty rude also.  I kind of felt he was like hurry up and get out of here!  But it's a beautiful day and I'm enjoying the outside tables!  Probably why I gave this experience 2 stars instead of 1!
2	oIFKPspHMI9CczptoBvqQ	Meh:  Go there because work is near by.  I think the food is over priced but dependable.  The pastas are the best best or the sandwich by itself.  Don't make the mistake of ordering a side of pasta which will net you a smallish cup (amounting to two forkfulls of pasta) for like four bucks.  Okay for a quick work bite.
4	o15Q593iNa3yKSS9tx4UwQ	Excellent pizza. I'm kinda a pizza snob having grown up on the east coast with frequent trips to NYC.  Its as good as some of the spots in NYC and even Rome. It definitely hit the spot. Best pizza I've had in at least a year. My wife gives it 5 stars. My wife and I will be coming back for more.
2	cEBEIELuOJzvohoKulU2w	Alas, my friends, it is with a heavy heart that I must demote Sushi Kaya from five stars to only two.    Since August, I have visited this establishment over 20 times, and until recently, always found the quality to be consistent.    My last 2 visits (5/1/2010 and 5/12/2010) were extremely disappointing.  As usual, my friends and I purchased the All You Can Eat sushi, and proceeded to order our favorites.  We were all in good spirits, expecting the feast that was to come - until we saw the food.   In the past, I would struggle to eat a piece of Kaya's nigiri sushi in a single bite.  The chefs cut the fish thick and broad, so that it completely covered its bed of rice.  Not anymore.  The mackerel, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri I received had been reduced to half the size, at least.  This, in of itself, is not a problem at an AYCE place.  I could overlook it as a cost-control measure, if the quality of the fish had not declined to the same pittance as the portion.  The fish was decidedly old - even a little dry in spots.  The chefs tried to cover up the worst selections with ponzu sauce.  I love ponzu, but on nigiri?  Sacrilege.     Rolls proved more palatable, if only for the multitude of ingredients drowning out the fish..  The only one that was actually delicious was the Spider Roll.  However, the sushi artistry I observed on my earlier visits was missing.   Each roll appeared sloppy on the plate, and the pieces were difficult to pick up intact.  Was the chef too hasty to give a damn about cohesion?  Was it his first day on the job?   I try not to judge too harshly, but I must also add that the avocados were inexcusable.  My avocado lover (an orb-like sculpture of shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado slices) was inedible.  The avocado was so hard and under ripe,  I'm surprised it could be sliced at all.  If the avocados are so petrified that I can't poke a chopstick through a thin slice, why would a chef deign to serve it?  I'm baffled..  The worst discovery of all was the tuna.  I'm a big fan of tuna.  I *KNOW* what tuna is supposed to look and taste like.  What Sushi Kaya currently serves as tuna is decidedly ANYTHING BUT.    I don't know what it is, exactly.  My best guess is dyed tilapia.  It has the strangest shade of pink I've ever seen - like a watermelon jolly rancher.  It has almost no flavor at all, and it flakes like a white fish.  Tuna:  you're doing it wrong.   Other small gripes include the watering down of their miso soup, and an unfortunate switch from their previous brand of green tea ice cream (very flavorful and creamy, with bitter tea notes) to a new brand (bland, too sweet, may as well be vanilla).  I don't know if Kaya is cutting corners, having issues with its supplier, or both, but I don't think I'll be back for a while.    The service and ambiance is still pleasant, so it keeps a few points for style.  I knocked them down to two stars, instead of one, in hopes that the restaurant gets its act together.
4	dgHYSAxAYxUAhAQLkLtBg	We ordered this online at work today for lunch, a large 3-topping (pepperoni, sausage, and ham).  The estimated time was within 40 minutes and we had it in about 25-30.  The pizza was hot and fresh with a nice crisp crust.  The delivery driver was friendly as well.  Overall, had a great experience and would order from here again.
4	ekCU9HkZZhBb7iZLYvW3w	Relatively easy to get in for an early lunch (say, when the doors open at 11:30am).  This place has a really neat menu.  Testosterone Salad with sirloin tips, greens, other stuff, and Potato Chips?  Pigs 'n puddin' which is pulled pork barbecued up on top of polenta.  Mushroom sandwich looked pretty darn good.  Seared tuna also looked tasty.  The item I ordered was the duck and brie melt sandwich.  Yum-O!    This place is worth trying just to read the unique food selection the menu.
4	olkZULcCO0uHQYUTEqUkw	Even though this isn't the most authentic mexican food, it's still my favorite in Madison.  It's fast and cheap, and pretty flavorful.  I really like their tamales.  My only problem with it is, for some reason, it's always cold in there, and my food is always a tad on the cool side.  I miss the Atwood Ave. location, and hate hate hate the new hilldale location.   The atmosphere there is hideous, and mcdonalds-y, even though it's sit-down.
4	H7SuJVeD6jAkvjXCJJVA	This Macayos puts the bell road one to shame, they actually have service, get your order fast, cook the food like how you ordered, etc. etc. etc.  Every problem I have ever expierienced at the bell road Macayos this place makes up for 10 fold. They have a popular happy hour at the bar, not for me. Great mexican food and expierience.
4	BJHtwY2rBRtk9vxV9PMYKg	Places like this remind me of how much i miss San Jose and places like Tapioca Express.   Ordered a Peach Yogurt snow with pears. larges are...LARGE but expensive San Jose i can expect to spend about 4.50 for one that's just a quarter smaller but here it's 6 bucks.   Other then being a penny pinching bastard i can find anything else wrong with the place, will try to come back to try the mango everyone's raving about as well as the chicken.  This place is MUCH BETTER then that other Taiwanese place down the road that everyone, employees and customers included give me the judging eyes for a foreigner. Note, i was born in CALIFORNIA and spent an enlistment in the Marines, i also practice my 2nd amendment right by owning a Springfield 40cal so if I am to be considered a foreigner, we got serious issues....  :: UPDATE :: Okay just bumped this place up from a 3 star to a 4 star. - The spicy fried chicken wasnt really spicy at all. it has as much heat as a chicken mcnugget + Finally found something i liked that made me go up a star and that's the Iced Bubble Coffee with pearl - Everyone raves about the mango snow ice i believe, to me it's not bad but i'd never order it again, it tastes too artificial and lots of it. + Seaweed wrapped chicken rolls are HIGHLY recommended
4	3zEXDAEPaLCJOWgMTpqqyg	This is definitely a hole in the wall place. I was actually picking up banh mi sandwiches and saw this place. The duck and pork were prepared as well as the places I go to in ATL. I will definitely be stopping by this place again when I'm in the area.
2	WwkpQ9ZGKGRYoekmdFePng	We went here a week or so ago after purchasing a Groupon.We got the bulgogi ($25) and kimchee soup ($10). The food was fine but over-priced. I don't think I would go back. There are better Korean restaurants that are more reasonably priced.
4	e52Wf1yu0gprsvPJ7noFeA	I should give Thai Taste 3 stars because 3 is where the waitress cut me off on the heat level of my curry.  Waitress: Would you like it spicy?  1-5? ML: 4. Waitress: 3 would be better [walking away].  True story.  But I wouldn't dream of giving the Double T anything less than 4 stars.  The chicken dumplings were really good, and my curry was exactly what I was looking for (maybe 25% less spicy?).  The service was also good, even considering the affront to my manliness.  We'll visit T^2 again - probably weekly until the waitress doesn't bat an eye when I order my curry at a 5.  I'm wishing we'd ordered double just so I'd have something for a late night snack.  Besides, two 3 curries = 6 overall, right?  And that would be like the 11 on the volume dial of Spinal Tap's amps, right?  Right?  Boo-yah!
4	V304utXrKqfOSi51W7O7bg	I discovered this place because of a GroupOn and after reading some of the Yelp reviews was pleasantly surprised. Service was excellent and the food was creative, tasty and reasonably priced. The western ambiance was fun too. I also would give it a 2 $$ rating versus a 3 $$$. Most entrees are between $10-15.
2	9bFXFotlTm2eun107fg	Be sure to try the hummus sampler!  Different flavors that I have never enjoyed before, all really good.   Loved the outdoor seating, perfect for a sunny, spring day!  I tried a lamb dish...silver skin was not removed before cooking = WAY TO TOUGH TO EAT!  Others in my party really enjoyed their food.  I would give it another try...just stay away from the lamb.  Sides were good.
4	LZ1Ol9tGNkCOknLKuFZlCg	Micheals is good stuff. This is excellent custard. Flavorful, smooth, rich. When I judge custard I try to look past the flavors of the day, the novelty sundaes, the toppings, and zero in on the taste and flavor of plain ol' vanilla. If the vanilla is good, then the custard is good. Micheals' has excellent vanilla. Micheals is, therefore, excellent custard.
4	8OzJsjwWdmjDNdsTNY522A	Mi Pueblo is very flavorful.  The ambience is horrible.  It's located in a strip mall on the outskirts of Metro Center.  Spinach enchilada's are some of the best I've had.  I'm a professional Cheese Enchilada eater :)  When I find a place that meets my standards I GO BACK!!!  I will go out of my way to eat a Mi Pueblo.  Just don't take a date there because she will think your a cheapskate.  You can keep this place as your secret.
4	Vh01xcWYK4cH9MN3Nx1ZA	Great sports bar to go to if you are in Scottsdale area- especially during Spring Training! All the waitresses are hot and very personable as well....Food isn't anything special but what sports bar does?!! Only a few blocks away from Scottsdale Stadium so great place to go and celebrate after the Giants win!
2	8xkjKoudDjJAAjUQ4mp0tQ	Bottom line: ACCEPTABLE - stop here if you're on business and need an outlet.  Pros: -Quite a few seats with access to outlets -Good service  Cons: -Does not taste good; chicken was rubbery (I know it is airport food...still expected something slightly better) -No value, quality not nearly justified by price
4	xVUX9mnjwHxN4u8ruec6g	My wife and I ate at Roberto's for the first time yesterday.  We are currently in the processing of moving from the Ozarks back to the Phoenix area after a ten year absence; one of the things we missed most while in Missouri, was Mexican food.  Since we are moving into the Anthem area we wanted to locate a decent place close by... We certainly found it at Roberto's.  Roberto's has a limited "eat-in" area and seems to cater mostly to take out and delivery but that certainly doesn't diminish the fact that this place makes great Mexican food.  I was very impressed... and we've eaten in countless places across the country claiming to serve Mexican food.  I had a chimichanga with rice and beans; my wife selected carnitas, flour tortillas and rice and beans.  We weren't disappointed.  We were also delighted to meet the owner, Roger, who was welcoming, personable and obviously well versed in the preparation of Mexican food.  The shredded beef in my chimichanga was wonderfully flavored, light and very good.  The beans were excellent and the salsa was very good.  My wife's carnitas were beautifully cooked being slightly crispy but still very moist and flavorful.  I'm looking forward to a long relationship with Roberto's; I plan to return frequently and try everything on the menu.  I would love to see Roger's business thrive and develop into a larger operation as a "sit-down" restaurant as did the original Garcia's (one of my all time favorite places).   I will certainly do my part by continuing to patronize Roger's fine establishment.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican Food and his place is one of the best and most affordable that I have ever patronized.
4	RwaUSwhurwjm8vX9EYvOGQ	First timers: we went today for early supper.    Mommy, Daddy and 3 year old Silly Pants (who was sleeping on Mommy's shoulder at first).  Greeted by very friendly Mom and Pop owners.    Housemade hummus plate was wonderful.  It had greek olives, fresh olive oil and a red spice sprinkled.  Very garlicy.  Mom told me that she makes the hummus with nothing from the can.  The pita it came with was a little stale, but still tasty.  Spanokopita was filled with spinach but not cheese.  Served with lovly tatziki sause.  Just perfect.  House Greek salad was great!  Fresh red onion, romaine, feta, tomatoes, olives and housemade dressing on side.  Just wonderful!  Our boy woke up and joined us for the entree.  Yay!  Gyro plate was divine.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had crispy edges.  The white onion was not strong and went so well with the fresh tomatoes and more tatziki sauce on top.  We had french fries, which were just right.  Freshly cooked.   Overall, clean, friendly atmosphere.  Very casual.    50 cents for refills.  Somewhat loud tv with game show on.  3 others came in for take out and complimented Mom and Pop for great food.  They were obviously regulars.    We will be back next time we are in the mood for gyros.    Wish they had baba ganoush.
2	NrxyuuAc2oWcgFhpChDOxQ	I enjoyed my food, but I was the only one in my party that did. Nice decor and pretty decent menu selection, but I have had far better mexican food before. I'm from So Calif, so it is hard to find good mexican when you travel, nothing tastes like home. I wouldn't return and if I was a local I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant again. Maybe my expectations are too high or their standards are too low.
2	tn25XEnwjuI4guOtXoshdw	I'm not sure what the hype is about this place... happy hour is all we go here for.    Probably been here a dozen times now. I'd call it an upscale dive bar.  Since it's close by and usually not busy we end up meeting people here. It's kinda hidden over by the oreck store behind the B of A on the street corner.  It's a small bar inside and about the same size outside. I think it opens at 4pm and doesn't do lunch.  The food is ok bar food. Honestly the cheeze wiz on the pizza is gross but drunk people seem to love it. Bar top is always dirty which is gross and it gets hot and humid inside a lot.  Patio area is probably the nicest place with the misters. Oh and they have free popcorn. There gigantic pitcher mixed drinks only have 1 shot which is misleading since they are the size of a pitcher. The shot-ski thing is kinda cool since someone always misses/spills. I wish they had a Polaroid/dig camera or something for shots of those.  Overall it's good for the HH but not much else.
2	WAq9OcHxIq3jJuIbd8EafA	The best thing about this place was the bathrooms! They were great, I would pee in them any day of the week. The food (lobster, fillet mignon) was nothing special and for the price I would have expected a little more food then what I got, that's for sure. The food came almost too fast which gave me the impression that the food was pre-made and just microwaved, and most of it was almost cold - so if I was them I would invest in a better microwave.   They did have good shrimp but you only get 3.   I have definitely had better and paid less for it.
4	q3c6Yf4x31rhpiCPAH04Uw	After a coworker came back from lunch with a roast beef sandwich on a King's Hawaiian roll from Arby's, I knew I had to go get one!  Located on South Blvd, near the Woodlawn intersection, in the same shopping complex as The Home Depot, Firehouse Subs and I think a TJ Maxx(?), the line at 12:50 on a bleh Wednesday was about 5 cars deep.  And of course I got behind the lady who didn't have windows that rolled down so she had to open her door, was placing separate orders for several people and I heard a lot of "ummmmmmmmmm....".  Go inside, fool!  The line did move fairly quickly up until her, so they don't play around at the drive thru here.  I ordered the aforementioned sandwich (LOVE King's Hawaiian rolls - that is a relationship that goes back a long time and it runs deep), mozzarella sticks and a cherry turnover.  The sandwich was quite good - I drown it in Arby's sauce, but there was plenty of meat on a large, soft bun.  The mozzarella sticks reminded me of McD's chicken nuggets for some reason - same kind of hard-ish coating instead of a crumby one, but they were as good as fast food mozz sticks are going to get.  Served with a small cup of marinara sauce, that was more flavorful than what I was expecting.  Cherry turnover was good - standard cherry pie filling in a flaky triangle of fluffy pastry with a drizzle of white icing across it.    The employees are quite friendly.  I go to this Arby's every few months and they are always friendly and get my order correct (with plenty of Arby's sauce).   My lunch was just under $9 and it will get me through to quitting time - good job, Arby's!
2	RFwfnJrURSlvvgXX61StNA	Yes... I went to Popeye's for dinner tonight.  I had a craving for popcorn shrimp and it was the closest thing to satisfy my hunger.  Is it just me or are their portions shrinking?  My popcorn shrimp was good and finger-lickin' greasy like I expected, but I could have eaten 3 times the amount! I guess that explains why they don't have a kid's menu and my boyfriend's son couldn't get a damn toy! They have obviously melded the two menus together and now I get to pay $6.95 for a combo that is kid-sized.
2	Ozi4tjQGY4qF19CGCA5LsQ	Food is great, but they're really let the bathroom cleanliness be ignored at this location.  Graffiti in the bathrooms, not clean, and just an "unkempt" feeling come about you when visiting this location.  I'll still go here because I love In-n-Out, but someone needs to get this location cleaned up.
4	IymCUlZgXXkvPwZFylnquA	Service is good but the food is really good.  If you are looking for something authentic and you want something different than the usual Panda Express and PeiWei this is the place to come.  The orange chicken its cooked different from any other place I've ever been and its really good.  I haven't tried a dish that I didn't like.  Order the dinner for two and you will be very pleased.  Fried rice soup its great too.
4	4eMmtWxYPdUMbrLCrZxEA	i love sub station! much better than sub way! I like that they slice you meats fresh. its not pre measured out. the quality of the meat is better. they have such an array of sandwich choices. This particular store sells meat by the pound. you can get a 3ft sub with 3 meats and 3 toppings for around $40 and a 6ft same way around $75. that would feed  lot of people!   the place is really clean, serve yourself beverages. and the staff was very nice!
4	KxkjQP3RsqoGt6LVEWFVw	I have been to this location several times and the food is very good for what it is! Most of the food is surprisingly fresh and flavorful. The salad bar is sufficient as well. The great thing is the selection of food offerings. Some of the things that I find consistently good are the Yankee pot roast, ham, grilled chicken and fried chicken. The vegetables are usually quite good too. The turnup greens were vibrant and very tasty, however, they didn't have any apple cider or pepper vinegar to go along with them - bummer! Like I said - overall pretty good for what it is.
4	Bv6Ceep6BuE9vVKaaxHzg	Have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was pretty spot on. The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.
4	isJtzQRbLuV5tLqmNsHKsw	I was craving a burrito and i've been to longboards a few times so I decided to visit moe's.   It's a Moe's.  They greet you on entry with the signature "Welcome to Moe's" although much to my liking they aren't super loud in a meal disrupting way...or maybe I was lucky.  The food is very consistent from store to store so I wasn't blown away, but enjoyed the familiar...and got what I expected.  I had a burrito prepared the way i wanted in front of my eyes with nice crispy chips on the side.  I didn't try out their Freestyle coke machine but rather drank some so-called "Northern Tea."  I don't really like that designation, but oh well.
2	uU8FdBCB6Y7VpXIWgRdgng	The short: Fine for a neighborhood drop-in, offering moderately priced pizza, pasta, subs, and a few Sicilian sandwiches (calzones), as well as some Greek options like gyros and baklava, but food isn't terribly exciting--and neither are the d\u00e9cor or staff.   The long: Located on the northwest corner of 52nd St. and Thomas, this little hole in the wall has been serving pizza, Italian, and Greek food since 1973. The restaurant interior is straightforward and frugal--you walk in and up to the counter that fronts the kitchen, peer into the cold case to the right holding Greek treats like baklava, or head to the little dining room to the left, filled with a handful of nondescript tables and chairs.   DiVito's is open Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and closed Sunday.  The offer weekday daily lunch specials for under $5. Pasta dishes for $8, including side salad and garlic bread. Pizza starting at $7.50 for a 12" cheese.   House salad was crisp. The wings hit the spot, without covering it. They were flabby skinned--cooked through, but not fried to give it a crust. I wasn't expecting it to be battered or anything, but I like a quick fry to hold the skin to the meat. The wing sauce was good enough--a bit of heat, a bit of tang, and down it went. We ordered Mama's Special: Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, olives, mushrooms & onions. No love for the pizza crust. It was baked just right, with some nice spotty oven char on the bottom, and the crust looked like it would be great, laced with big air bubbles, but there was no chew. I wasn't expecting a big bubble gum bite, but I like a bit of chew, and with that chew, some of the flavor that tells me the dough was allowed to rest for awhile to develop. This dough yielded instantly with a bite, then quickly disintegrated in my mouth as if it were Wonder Bread. In a backwards way, it was left to be carried by the toppings, but alas, those were subpar--the lightly spread sauce (just right in quantity, bland in quality), mozzarella, sausage, black olives, mushrooms--it was all off the supermarket shelves. The Sicilian meatball sandwich had the same crust, and it was more obvious here, in plain sight, but still a wallflower. Again, more rise time, and a sprinkle of salt in the dough, and maybe we could've been friends. I liked the innards, even though it wasn't the big globes of meatballs sweating into marinara that I was expecting. The meatball meat--just nicely seasoned lean ground beef--was scooped in, filling every inch of the sandwich's cavern (no annoying air bubble cubby holes of emptiness), and sprinkled with mozzarella. Again, not great, but adequate, and everything I wish a Hot Pocket could be, if not the calzone I'd expected. The lasagna I especially wanted to love, especially with its menu tag: "the best you've ever tasted." Here, I loved the composition--not too much noodle, not too much cheese, not too much sauce inside, though the thing was really swimming in sauce when I received it. I easily sopped that up with the very tasty and perfectly crisp garlic bread, though. I liked whatever herbs they seasoned their ricotta with, and that they seasoned the ricotta at all, since it's too often neglected in lasagna dishes. I just felt like the sauce was missing something, and it fell just flat. Maybe a few glugs of wine or some minced garlic would've given it the light bite I was looking for. The desserts were also fine. The cannoli in its fried shell wasn't traditional, filled with a slightly starchy vanilla pastry cream instead of sweetened ricotta, but it was crispy and creamy and sweet. The tiramisu was tasty, but I couldn't taste any Marsala in the zabaglione, so I declared it decidedly kid-friendly.   One of the best things about DiVito's food is that it kinda tasted better the next day, reheated. *shrugs* Maybe it's one of those things that needs a night to allow the flavors to meld? With decent prices and decent food, especially when a craving hits, I won't mind going back to further test this theory. I wish I could give them 2.25 stars: "Meh, it's ok."
4	fYkgh8WlvLzKvdtNyvQA	Great food, keep in mind it's a family run affair. I want to preface this review by saying I'm a huge fan of this place. The Stone House may well be my favorite restaurant. That being said, I simply can't objectively give it 4 stars. It's not a professionally run restaurant. The food is generally great, the appetizer sampler is a must have. Entrees are mostly good, though there are some exceptions. This is the type of place you love for it's character and it's flaws, not despite them. Worth at least one visit, it may not be for everyone, but there is some fantastic food and atmosphere to be had.
4	PJItMAgkGRjgm0gm0pC9Fw	Good food, great atmosphere...   This place is entirely underground, all you'll see when you drive up is a little shack-like building. The seafood is only fresh and well prepared. Drinks are well poured (strong).   I hear happy hour here is a good deal.
2	UbGoV9wtBvLdFCQFQYdwA	The atmosphere was great here...very country. The service was awesome and the food was piping hot!  The quality of the food was very generic though. I don't think the cooks are at fault here, it's just the way the food was bought. **Think cafeteria food... no flavor, bulk items, and pretty....well generic.**   Keep in mind, you're paying for the experience, not so much the food.   Try Bill Johnson's, they seem to have a better food.
4	lgbOffVAQM5YepOx9fomw	I've been to Pasta Brioni more than a handful of times over the years... and I've never been disappointed.  It's a fun girls night out, but it's also great for date night or with a group.  Most recently, I went with a group of 8 of us on a Saturday night.  It was a spontaneous decision that the birthday girl (Halley S) made with some persuasion from her fiance and my boyfriend too.  (I think they really wanted Italian food).  Luckily, Brioni accommodated us and we were seated within minutes of arriving.  The ownership may have changed, and maybe the waiters weren't as HOT as i remembered, but we were all pleased with our experience.  Justin was our waiter and he put up with some random questions from my boyfriend (IE - are all Maryland Crab Cakes from Maryland?) - he'd been drinking all day long; forgive him!  The warm rolls were as good as ever and we were all happy that there was plenty of olive oil, parmesan, and balsamic on the table ready and waiting for us to dip into!  I started with a dirty Grey Goose martini and it went down real easy... The birthday girl and some of the other girls seemed to enjoy their blueberry lemon drop martinis also.  Some of us had wine with dinner and that was good too...   Onto the food - I had a few bites of the artichoke appetizer (note that it's served cold, but it's tasty!)  For my entree, I went with the tilapia special of the day - it was a huge portion and it was great; served with veggies but I had a side of pasta too (after all, we were at PASTA Brioni!)  Others in the group had the grilled salmon special, mushroom ravioli, gnocchi, chicken martini (this is a special recipe that is really good) and maybe chicken parmesan.  No complaints from anyone - pretty cool!  We didn't order dessert since we had Sprinkles cupcakes... it was really sweet that our waiter even served them for us - not all restaurants are so accommodating when you bring in outside food).  All that and total per person (of course we all paid for the birthday girl too) was $48 including 20% tip.  Not bad for a Saturday night out for a special occasion!  We are excited to be moving back into the Old Town 'hood - I'm sure we'll make Pasta Brioni one of our regular stops on the restaurant rotation... maybe we'll see you there?!
4	OBFHep1gsFLbpPZqtPNFpg	I had a little business to do on Mount Washington this morning.  So after stepping off the Mon Incline, I decided to treat myself to lunch at one of my favorite Chinese places.  I opted for the Lighter Fare Chicken & Vegetables.  That way, I had room for my eggroll.  The chicken was absolutely perfect--not greasy at all.  Yes, I know that "Lighter Fare" is all relative, but that's my story and I'm stickin' to it!.
2	HCd0C1kEeREQRxyGDsdwyA	Huge portions continue here after new ownership took over but I liked the flavor and quality of the food better before.  The food is nothing memorable. The meat was a little dry and very fatty. (shrug)  I used to recommend the place with the old ownership, but I can't say the same anymore. If you're *dying* for BBQ and happen to be in the area, it's okay.  But it's not a place to drive cross town for.
2	fnZwKkfjqjxMZqfNG2OCqw	Deep-fried chicken, fish, polish sausage, wings, fries, and okra (only). No frills place at the corner of Washington and Philo in Urbana - parking for 4 cars, seating for the same. Awesome home-made sauce, but that would be the only reason I would ever go back.
4	f1nj2S5NCYH0e0pQ0Cgkrg	My search for the perfect torta continues...  Heard a lot of talk about this place, so we went for lunch. Decor is cute, clean, colorful. Rainforest murals, lots of hanging flags. Service, awesome, language being no issue. Lunch specials hover at 5-6 bucks, combos 6.50. Comprehensive menu, 4-5 soups, fajitas, even saw oxtail on there. Lots of breakfast options, with no hourly limitations. 7 tortas to choose from.  The one I wanted wasn't on there (huevos y queso) but special ordering it was no problem. It was out in a jiffy, and huuuuge. Huuuuge. I wish I'd stuck a quarter in the pic for scale - easily the size of both my hands, side by side, open. Eating it wasn't gonna happen without slicing it into fourths, which I did. I'd declared my love for jalapenos and was brought a small bowl of (methinks) homemade carrots and peppers, for fwee, which I ate like deli pickles. Yum.  STILL not the sammich I'm searching for, but good. The bun tasted like a really good, really fresh hamburger bun, covered in sesame seeds. Instead of oaxaca, cheddar cheese found its way into my torta (sigh). Still, a tasty rendition.   Huevos Rancheros - basically fried egg soup. No rice, so you're going to be wrapping what's hidden under that (tasty, tomato-y) pile of Ranchero sauce up in your tortillas, trying to eat the whole thing before it squeezes out onto your lap. Not the best thing to order if you're a messy eater and wearing white.  Salsa is served warm. This was a first for both of us.  Kitchen isn't that well ventilated, so if the smell of charring beef turns you off, you might want to get take out.   All in all, delicioso! We'll be back.
2	aia5ELBiR8JnmYkAkXu4LQ	While living up in the PNW of Washington I would see these tee-shirts and bumper stickers for the In n Out Burger joints and wonder what I was missing. So I come to AZ and I see them all over. One day (months ago) I try one. Hmmm I haven't missed a darn thing is my conclusion. It hasn't grown on me. I've not been tempted to return. I've been repelled to avoid it is more like what happened. All desire to experience it again was removed by one visit to this lame enterprise. Nothing is cool about it, fun about it, or great. I love burgers and fries, can eat them three or more times a week if I allowed myself, however this place doesn't do the great American meal any justice, sorry they could fold up and close their doors without making a blip on any radar screen of dining experience.
4	vIEXv7cPBAUSImOqZ6s4Q	The service here is definitely the selling point.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The food was a solid okay and the beer selection was above average.  I really liked the outdoor seating area though it was constantly polluted by cigarette smoke which makes it uncomfortable for nonsmokers to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather.  I am sure I will be back, but I'll remember my gas mask.
4	r0dW9M8QPc9E4u6RtePeA	Once inside, you'd never know that outside the windows (which due to relfective covering and decor sort of disappear)...lies an ugly strip mall in a non-descript transition neighborhood next to ASU.  That said, lamb vindaloo is a tasty treat and when you order it hot, it actually comes HOT (spice).    Place never seems to be busy when I'm there (mid-week) but servers are attentive and typically have given me a free naan or some other treat.    Go for the mango yogurt drink if you can't take the heat.
2	W6TGRqpaKofwHt5Ag4KQ	I've eaten at the Sahara location and been satisfied with Sammy's before.  This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.  The menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  "Tapas" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.  No comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.  For those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci "you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin" hahaha.  Overall, just didn't stick out as a place I would ever return to for pizza and its in the freakin name of the restaurant.... come on!!!
2	wOgIcAWn2ioLl3PP1rY5g	Premi\u00e8rement, juste le fait qu'on ne peut pas payer par carte, c'est poche parce qu'on doit payer des frais au guichet du restaurant.  Pour la nourriture, j'\u00e9tais super satisfaite. J'adore la poutine de la belle province... Elle est sal\u00e9e et fromag\u00e9e comme je l'aime! Ce que j'ai le moins aim\u00e9 de ce commerce sur wellington, c'est le service \u00e0 client\u00e8le. Je l'ai trouv\u00e9 m\u00e9diocre; la caissi\u00e8re avait l'air de d\u00e9tester son travail et \u00e0 cause de \u00e7a, mon copain et moi ne nous sentions pas les bienvenus et \u00e7a nous a donn\u00e9 envie de ne jamais revenir dans cette succursale. \u00c7a se peut que ce soit juste la caissi\u00e8re le probl\u00e8me, elle a peut-\u00eatre quitt\u00e9 son poste parce que \u00e7a fait des mois que c'est arriv\u00e9, si ce n'est pas un an. Mais \u00e7a m'avait vraiment marqu\u00e9 et j'esp\u00e8re que le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9 d'ici l\u00e0...
2	cxBLK9Wgbub6T9ZvCwCWsg	I've eaten at many Hard Rocks, and they're all the same and there's a certain fun charm to some of them. This one didn't have it. The servers were very interesting (my waitress was a McGill student from California, so we bonded over that) and the food was meh. I do enjoy their burgers, and that's what I always get, but the prices, the noise and the crowds all lead to a 2 in my book.
2	VLXYGod7DHneGXDYXROCGQ	I want to like this place.  I'm a fan of Peruvian food, and was delighted when this place opened in Oakland back in 2009.  However, the disappointment I experienced during the first visit surged again during the visit today.  Both times I ordered the 1/4 chicken combo, which comes with two sides.  I don't recall the sides I ordered the first visit, but the ones today (the sweet potato fries and pinto beans) were the saving grace of the visit.  Fries were fresh and crispy (although somewhat less so by the time I got them back  to my office); pinto beans were well-seasoned and savory.  But the chicken, the main reason I went to AJ's?  In contrast to other reviewers' experience, the chicken was terribly dry and not particularly flavorful on both trips.  On my first visit in 2009, I chalked it up to the expected hiccups of a place that had just opened. Two years later, that excuse no longer holds any water.  The 1/4 chicken portion today was from a small bird, and composed of a wing and breast. Perhaps because of the small size, the little meat on the wing was so dry as to be crunchy...and not in a pleasurable way.  The skinny breast was also dry and fibrous.   My side order of aji pollero sauce, while piquant and delicious, could not save the chicken.    Perhaps there's something different about the chicken at lunch (left over from the day before?), but I'm not likely to rush back.  My last complaint about the place...again one that I initially chalked up to just-opened hiccups...is how long it took to get my order. Both times I was the only person there.  Both times it took 15-20 minutes to prepare my order.  Odd.  To avoid ending on a sour note, besides the delicious sides and aji pollero sauce, the other clear positive at AJ's are the employees, who were friendly and welcoming both visits. Makes it that much harder to leave this negative review....
2	T3e4kSaPVfox0HkOwRQCw	Unfortunately this is not my first time here.  On previous times I've been here the experience has been more than sub-par... but today I couldn't figure out what to eat so I landed here.  Figured there's a banner outside that said under new management so I'd give 'em yet another try.     On first glance the joint looks glammed up a bit more than on previous trips here.  You know a lil extra decor here, a lil decor there... I end up making my way to an available table, got my drink order in then made my way to the buffet line.  At that exact point I realize my mistake of giving this place another shot.     I opted for the broccoli beef, bbq pork, general Tsao chicken and some vegetable fried rice.  All except the rice looked fairly unpleasing (like they been left in the tray too long and yet those were their best options).  Got back to my table and dug into the pork and found it was so overdone, it was dry and hard.  The beef was so rubbery, the broccoli way overcooked and dark.  And the rice although good looking was so hard and undercooked that I almost broke teeth and lost a few fillings.  Left that after a few bites, then noticed I'd get some shrimp they had just taken out and figured I'd take advantage of something fresh.  Fresh it was and salty as heck too, making me sip my Pepsi away in two gulps to counter the Salton Sea I had just ingested.     In all this not a good place to eat.  I've been here 3 times.  As the old saying goes, "3 strikes and you're out."  Yes it's under new management, but it must be the same crummy cooks and perhaps the same motto applies to this management of leaving old food in the tray and making it look so unappetizing that they don't care.  They must be rich to not care to make a quality product, scratch that, decent product.      2 of 5 for their decor and their attentive waiters.  I so wanted to give this place a shot, but alas, fool me three times shame on me...
4	nWEkDXiIEt0z4U5Jg0gDQ	We had a ladie's group of about fifty or so for lunch and the service was great or food was abundant and tasty and we had our own private room! The lunch portions are HUGE! I had fried baby shrimp and my leftovers looked like more than I ate! I loved the hushpuppies and the tartar sauce was delicious (and I am finicky about mine)  Our waitress was awesome and I thought she handled our table of eight superbly! The only " complaint" was that our bill was done by the table and we had to split it at the cashier prompting us all to leave at once or return the ticket to the others. Not a huge deal but a tad inconvenient.
4	KtEqxMRPfYzelfbRCV02cw	Same here, nothing to complain about. I really like the location of this bar. It's tucked away just West of the strip in a dark area with the Vegas lights in full sight. Perfect place to chill and get a few cold ones in before going inside.   I been here a few times all for bands coming through town. They have a nice little set up inside with a back room and small stage for the bands.   It's been a few months since I been here but I'll definitely be back when another worthy name comes through.
4	u6KuiGhksxhPjPr3MJ9yqg	A high-end steak house, Midwestern college town style, dark and traditional with some trendy accents for the kids.  Adjoins the celebrated Tornado Club, where (rumor has it) the members of the rock band Garbage have been known to hang out regularly.
2	UzWF7YfJCf90by01YKuSNQ	Sweet "O" is more like Sweet "NO".   Was intruiged by their website and good reviews, went on a wednesday afternoon around 430. We were the ONLY table. We ordered a two drinks, two sandwiches, and one dessert to share. The drinks were good, and the food had a lot of potential (although one sandwich was better than the other...) until I found a pretty gross hair embedded in the middle of my sandwich, mid-bite. Now, anyone who's worked food service can respect the occasional mistake. Sure, you cant control when your hair falls out. But what is getting the bad review from me is how BADLY the staff handled it.   Upon notifying the waitress, she unapologetically stated "Well I have no idea how that could have possibly gotten in there"... Almost as if I placed it there. It was short, black, and still had skin connected to it. I don't have short black hair. So she took it away. She then asked if I would like something else, to which I asked if it were possible to make another half sandwich. She came out with a completely different sandwich than I ordered (which of course was the one I didn't care for). So I gave up on trying to get any more dinner and we focused on dessert. It was decent, but nothing I couldn'tve gotten at applebee's on happy hour.   Then came the bill. Not a single thing had been comped, and it reached $60 dollars. When my friend complained, the waitress hastily said "I'll get the manager". Manager comes bustling out, sets a new bill on the table, and walks off.   I understand mistakes in food. I truely do. But the way this staff handled a mistake that was completely their own was ridiculous. Never ONCE in the evening did we get an "I'm sorry" from any staff member.  I won't be going back there again. And by the attitues they exhibited, It didn't appear as if they cared that I told anyone else not to go there either.  2/19/08 EDIT: The owner has contacted me, apologized, and shared that there is new management. Might be worth another try.
2	SJGin10pjFzpSLk15VA3Vw	I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.  Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good.  I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy.
2	fk8zZyiLJ2rfOGxPIxDUOw	Donatos would have received three stars except the management is horrible. I have always had a positive experience at Donatos and have always enjoyed the food. It isn't the greatest pizza in Charlotte but it is certainly not the worst. My mother, however, has not had the same experience.   My mother has a hangup with pepperonis. She likes them but she doesn't LOVE them. Everytime she orders her usual pepperoni and onion pizza she always specifies light on the pepperonis. She had never been to Donatos and was unfamiliar with their obsession with pepperonis. She called in her order and told the girl on the phone that she wanted 25 percent of the pepperonis they typically use on their "edge to edge" pepperoni pizza. She picked the pizza up and brought it home to find that they had given her an edge to edge pepperoni pizza. She promptly returned the pizza and politely asked to speak to a manager about the situation. She explained the situation and he acted like she had lobsters crawling out of her ears. He was unwilling to remake her pizza and even shared a laugh at her expense with a fellow patron who couldn't understand why my mother would not want 500 pepperonis on her pizza. She called the district manager and complained about the general manager but has not been back to Donatos since.   I don't know if this will change your opinion or not but even though Donatos has decent pizza, they clearly have issues with customer service.
4	SDOhjelXslDgeCEiDBmQ	Ordered the lunch Barg, let me tell you, this should not be lunch, more like lunch and diner.  The portion was plenty big and could have been easily shared with another.  I was very happy with it.  The flavor and taste is what I expected from center cuts of filet Mignon, skewered, marinated and broiled.  I went with a group of 6 and we opted to get the Persian Room Appetizer, again, a mistake on my part, the appetizer was perfect for 6, not totally unnecessary with the portions that we had.  The service was as expected from an up-scale type restaurant and would be great for taking the high-end clients to for celebrating a big success.
4	sHb04R2gXLxpVtQ5BHmA	Fast and friendly. The gyros actually taste like gyros. Although they don't fillem'  full of meat like they do up north. Their tender tips with onions and peppers is awesome. I always get filled up on the platter. Pretty good value and the people that work there are very nice and helpful.
4	KX1fBcexjVhB2r3ETTfzg	This place will always have a special place in my heart since my husband and I went here the morning after our wedding. We shared the apple pancake and it was oh so good! Yes, the line is long, but I don't mind. I'm just happy that there are still places like this in Phoenix.
2	Wf1DzvxtHkMvQvWm96oFA	Dont come here unless you like bland food, indifferent service, all the booths camped out in by businesses conducting loud meetings or singles playing on laptops. The only reason I gave them two instead of one stars is that their bathrooms are very clean
4	4XvR3c1P4ASfSoBkJedDA	Real nice local place in Matthews. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching and the food was above average. The menu was somewhat normal for I did not see much that really jumped out at me but the service was good and the quality of the food was above average.  We will be back for lunch or maybe dinner.
2	XcXI7vX2MQysn8yfohr81Q	I'll just get to the point. Staff, great.  Cleanliness, great.  Food, eh.  Calamari was actually the best part.  It appeared to be fresh because it was not over cooked and rubbery. However the bottom pieces were a little mushy from the grease.   We had the porterhouse and filet.  They were cooked perfect (medium rare). However they had absolutely no flavor what so ever.  I tried adding salt and that just made it unflavored salty meat. It is hard to imagine and hard to describe that there was no flavor to the meat.  The house salad was nice but the Caesar had way too much dressing.  Needless to say we will not be going back.
2	kKRqZHXCrxoBwW4ujLHw	We decided to try this place after walking around during Glendale Glitters (everywhere else was packed, and this place was empty).  When we walked in, the woman who 'greeted' us was decidedly not welcoming.  We were the only ones in the entire restaurant (a converted house).  She asked we wanted to order before we even got a chance to look over the menu.  It took forever to get drinks though.  At NO TIME AT ALL was she friendly, chatty, welcoming, etc--it was very much like being an uninvited or unexpected guest in her private home.    Being a working mom myself, I understand having your children around, but after having her son run across the room four times in 10 minutes it was very disconcerting and not hard to see WHY this place wasn't busy.  It took a good 40 minutes for food, which while tasty, shouldn't have taken 40 minutes to prepare (the only thing that would have taken a bit was chicken fried steak--everything else we ordered was 'slow cooked' therefore only needs plating!).  Bear in mind, the food was delicious, but I just wouldn't wait that long for food!  I'd recommend eating somewhere else unless you have well over an hour to kill and don't mind feeling like you are invading someone's private space.
2	86mIv7MBMKEhXtQ50ryyw	I loved Cosi lunch back in the day when I worked in the Loop in Chicago. Since I was on the west side of Madison and lost in a sea of chain restaurant options, I thought Cosi would be the lesser of the evils. Plus, they have patio seating.  I ordered the hibiscus mint iced tea (good), an Adobo chicken salad and a side of tomato basil soup.  Soup was barely warm, trending cold. I ordered the salad without the tortilla strips and with very light dressing. I can see my receipt captures the correct order. However, the lettuce was drowning in a very tangy dressing and they forgot to include the chicken. I really needed a little protein and appreciated that the chicken they serve has no antibiotics added. Too bad I didn't get any!  I guess the good news is I really stuck to my diet by only eating a 5 oz soup and bit of romaine lettuce for lunch. I did have a couple bites of the flatbread with my soup. I try to stay away from bread since it's so calorie-dense, but it was definitely the star of the meal.
4	mNDCETnQmXjAMJZsvJPesA	Li'l Porgy's good food, fast service.Top of the line B.B.Q. best in town? No, but pretty darn good, and you can see it cooking over the wood.As for the  complaint of soggy bread ask for your sauce on the side,they don't have a problem doing that for you. I do that all the time, long drive home and the bun will get soggy.The fries are always under cooked, you have to look at that as a good thing if you get it to go, you get home and finish them off and you get nice hot and crunchy fries. The tub o tips with hot sauce will take care of any B.B.Q. craving. I have never had poorly or over cook meat of any kind here.
4	3wOSOnkQtLf0w8sbBNw	My fiance and I order from Pizza Extreme fairly frequently. They always deliver in a timely fashion, the cheese is amazing, and they have RC Cola!   One time, after a night of drinking, my fiance called and ordered "two of the biggest pizzas they have" for delivery. Well, twenty minutes and fifty dollars later, we had two of the biggest pizzas I have ever seen sitting in my kitchen. We were eating pizza for days. And it was delicious.
2	MxVYRXz4sYhuluDE0UIlw	Ok, I was trying to be adventurous for the group.  I don't really have a palate for Lebanese food, but it wasn't bad.  I am a huge fan of fatoosh salad and that was definitely a good choice.  The table ordered 4 dishes that included filet pieces and chicken pieces with rice, a ground meat concoction and a hummus appetizer.  The hummus was good.  The fillet and chicken were ok.  If I were talked into going again, I'd probably order a gyro next time.
2	VXoOTN61NPH7E4OmMhMIeg	We were at the New York New York for the Manhattan Express roller coaster... and after walking around so much, we were hungry.   We shared a hot dog and some fries. Both were edible/decent.. nothing special here.
4	2t9R3nzNXgzP3J9nDltBLw	ohhhhhhh, I am craving The Golden Greek right now.  SO since I can't eat it, I will review it.  I have not been in some time but as far as I can remember it was one of the best Greek meals I have ever had.  The ambiance is hmmmm.... how do you say this? Dumpy?  But the food is just so fabulous that you forget you are sitting in a booth with duct tape holding it together.  The gyros are excellent.  Give it a try if you are in the area.  The price is affordable too.
4	dyku5iDaiFPgTD6xIUtvA	Awesome coffee selection, great working environment.  They offer a wide variety of beans, and will make a single pour-over of any bean they have.  The barrista was very knowledgeable, and the bean he recommended for my taste preferences (the Costa Rican Noir) was exactly what I wanted.  In fact, I came back for a second cup, it was that good.  Reasonably priced (~$2.50 for a half-liter large coffee), with waffles and oatmeal in addition to the usual coffee-shop scones and muffins.  This was not the most absurdly gourmet coffee experience of my life, but the coffee was darn good, the chairs were comfy, the wifi was reliable (although there is a shortage of electrical outlets), and the service was excellent.  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Madison.
2	i8GWOEV4EQpDRHPTwyCjbA	I was *so* excited to go to Toast and had been wanting to go for ages given the breathless reviews I keep reading of it.    I started with the mac and cheese with pork shank and egg. The egg added nothing to the dish and only aggravated its already runny texture.  For my main course I had a fettucine with chicken and rosemary (I was carb-loading, apparently).  The dish was fine, but had nothing special or memorable about it.  I'm reasonably adept at cooking Italian food and felt that I could have made a comparable or better dish at home.    The atmosphere is interesting - the bar area downstairs is very hip and fun-looking, while upstairs (where we ate) was very quiet . . . verrrrry quiet.  I could hear everything everyone else was saying.   Although I feel that I should give Toast! another chance, I am unwilling to do so at the price point.
2	iitQsDdgiBBu9j5WtfUrQ	I had a craving for pizza. So this is where the review starts...  We decided to go to Sammy's and I was pleasantly suprised at the outside seating area. Unfortunately, I get cold easily so I stayed inside. However, there is a nice little fire going with booths and tables surrounding it.   I opted for the Tuscan pizza while my bf chose the New York. I secretly liked his better and was jealous that I didn't chose that one. But we share so I did get a piece of the pie.   I choose Tuscan because of the arugula and prosciutto. I know prosciutto is salty but it didn't seem to fare well on my pizza. Plus, I didn't know that it was fresh arugula on my pizza... It was a suprise. But I ate the pizza with no complaints...  However my friends.... the NEW YORK pizza was delicious.  MEAT! MEAT! MEAT! Could have had more salami but I guess all good things in moderation.   Would I go here again? Possibly. But I think I'll try out other pizza joints in the area first.
2	r9GiZFoDCd2IjJVmDEidw	Me and some of the boys were feeling like ribs after seeing Sweeney Todd.. yeah we're sick like that.. would have preferred meat pies.. ANYHOO.. got there during lunch time.. I'm not a fan of the whole corporate shtick and this place is well.. all shtick.. from the 'leg lamp' to the bottle caps glued on the wall this place is actually more kitsch and not in a good way. I would like to say though that the chair I sat in was SO comfortable that I could sit and stare at all the crap on the walls for hours. I mean seriously, there is tons of stuff on the walls there, dizzying.   Being the adventurous one, ordered the fried pickles.. ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them.. well, I wouldn't order those again.. let's just say I like my pickles firm! I ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch.. not much to say about it.. it was what it was.. overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip (was very tender) all covered in cubes of cheese. In fact none of us even ordered the ribs *sigh*.   The service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large. Typical corporate experience not to good, not to bad just ho hum.. will probably not return. Prefer Joe's BBQ for the time being.
2	7Ny1ywP1JakM1MqBuWtQ	Walked in and all three employees were in the back sitting on the food prep counters... Fries were not bad, but a little undercooked and the Louisiana rub had so much seasoning/salt I could blow it off every wing and it was just over powering! The teriyaki and BBQ sauces were both good but all the wings were over cooked. I will not go back here..... I'd rather pay a little more for Buffalo Wild Wings!
2	m4skonORqv1D2sBWcWEYw	Overpriced and not good. I would rather go to the panda express further up the road. I got the cashew chicken for lunch, and there was an abundant amount of cashews, celery, and maybe 2-3 pieces of chicken. That's it! It was definitely not worth the money and I wanted cashew chicken not cashew celery!
4	dTFr8lCJwZVDWOxv4aSTbA	I'm all about an economical, hearty breakfast and man, was I satisfied.  After waiting unsuccessfully at John's around the corner, I decided to try Sammy's Deli with a friend.  We walked in, the cashier, took our order immediately, and were brought heaping portions of breakfast in 5 minutes or so.  Fair enough.  For $3.50, I got 2 eggs, sausage, a biscuit, and hashbrowns! The eggs were fluffy, the sausage not too greasy, and the hashbrowns cooked Waffle House style, mmm hmm.The coffee was served in 20 ounce styrofoam cup and surprisingly did not taste like the sludge served at gas stations.  The menu seemed to be pretty non-descript and most folks gravitated towards the breakfast special.  Granted, the place is a bit dingy.  Or "dive-ey" as they say in Plaza-Midwood, But the friendly, "What can I get you, hon?" cashier and the tasty food makes up for it.  If you like greasy, unpretentious breakfast fare and don't mind being served on Styrofoam plates, you're in for a treat!
2	9RiykgCFk9NGP62NOqpZXw	Known for their mussels, the Rude Native is alright.  I'll tell you what I like about the Rude Native. It's bright and colourful, they have a patio and the restaurant itself has kind of a funky trendy feel to it.   The appetizer menu doesn't have much worth sharing when you have someone in your group that prefers to avoid sea food. The main menu is small but the couple things I've sampled have been okay.   This time around we ended up ordering the Quesadillas and Flat Bread to share. I did like the coffee bbq sauce or the Flat Bread but the rest of it was just okay.  Overall, nothing too wrong with this place but nothing great about it either (says the girl who isn't crazy about mussels). I'd try Waterloo's other restaurants over this one given the choice.
2	ZxD23Lsos8jdxDnfhpYrw	I have to go with the review (Mireille M.) talking about the service.    Don't get me wrong, the food is EXCELLENT.  And if the chef was cooking at my house, I would give him/her 4 stars.  I also think the atmosphere is cozy and enjoyable.    But the path to being a great restaurant (and a great restauranteur) is hiring and training a smart and knowledgeable staff who can talk about the food without reading verbatim from their specials card AND know something (anything?) about the wine list.  They are the point of contact for the dining experience.  Our guy seemed nice but really couldn't answer any questions about the food, the wine, current events, basic math, anything.    Because of the price-point relative to the service, I have to say I've experienced MUCH better in Pittsburgh.
4	wBfLRxYOnq1rnFkeiAr0TQ	Discovered thanks to fellow Yelpers for lunch the other day and they didn't let me down.  This is a really fun place with lots of menu items to choose from.  I opted for the salad bar and 3 pcs of their broasted chicken.  They have an excellent salad bar.  I like their potato salad and cole slaw very much.  The variety of vegetables is very good but they need to label the salad dressings.  The chicken is crispy and nicely seasoned.  It's still fried chicken but supposedly pressure cooking imparts less oil.  This seemed true enough for this bird as it wasn't greasy, just delicious.  The staff is friendly and I love the place.  I'll be back for more.
2	BjIR0v7vN0KmFiuWyUJZjQ	Location: Notre-Dame West  Eats: Since I was going to be checking out the first restaurant on my #TasteMTL list later on, I opted for a Macchiato and a croissant. The Macchiato was strong as all hell and I'm surprised I wasn't bouncing off the walls by the time I was done. It was a little bitter but overall, decent. Have I had better? Yes. The croissant was fine - fat and crispy on the outside, softish on the inside. Nothing to write home about.  Service: First, despite the sign that says someone will seat you, we seated ourselves because no one bothered to greet us. The place wasn't full but the service was slow and the staff seemed uninterested in its patrons. Furthermore, this has got to be the clumsiest wait staff in all of Montreal! Not only were dishes dropped and broken on two separate occasions, but one waiter actually dropped a fork down my back (the wrong way - prongs scratching and all) and didn't even bother to apologize. Seriously? How the hell does that even happen? Really not impressed with these people. Not to mention that every time they walked behind me they would hot my chair - there was plenty of room between me and the person behind me, to avoid doing that.   It's a cute place but would I go back? Probably not.
4	P8jcFfC5YCOzkoTTVQAJFQ	This place is great! Can't go wrong with the soups, salads, or sandwiches. The only complaint is that it can get a little pricier than similar places, around $10-$11 for a sandwich and small drink. I can't wait to try breakfast here!
4	L1lM4L7RRkOwdx6bjxbAKA	Tasty tasty tacos! Ingredients seem pretty fresh, and it's really really cheap. We're talking 6 or 7 bucks for tacos, beans, and rice, or whatever other combo plate you choose. They're also open 24 hours, and conveniently located next to a bar. The only downside to the place is it's ambiance. It's not a nice looking feeling place. It's a run down counter service shop with a few tables and chairs. It's a little on the trashy looking side, but the food's good, the service is friendly, and it's mostly a takeout kind of place anyways.
2	pTJzkjMzdmBf7HJAV3FPcg	Would I come back.. hmm, no.... well... no...  I don't want to say I wouldn't be back because this place is awful. It's not... it's just that there are so many other places that would probably be better deserving of my pounds...  So, it's a Monday morning. My husband has decided to go hike Arthur's seat with a friend who ran up it and then came back down to meet him to walk up it. Yes. That dude did it twice in one day. I am a firm believer of know-your-limit-play-within-it, so I went to breakfast with the others instead. Wonderful breakfast mates who wanted to shop after.  Place is empty. We get seated in a booth and brace ourselves for the American-ness of this place. Meh. It's a regular restaurant. I had the sausage and egg sandwich and an Americano. That's easy. One friend got the vegetarian breakfast minus the eggs (she's not, but was eating healthy to fit in her wedding dress) and her hubby-to-be got the bacon and egg sandwich with a side of hasbrowns. He asked what kind of hashbrowns they had. Our server looked at him like he asked what animal chicken eggs come from. I could feel the you're-dumb glare. She said they were fried. Still didn't explain: we were going more for are they homemade, are they potatoes just fried, are they packaged? I guess she thought we would know what American hashbrowns would be? For future, they have the disc kind, like the ones from McDonalds. Deep fried and good...   My sandwich was okay... my sandwich was just sausage and eggs. I don't know what I was expecting, but it's exactly as they say on their menu. It's sausages stuffed into a bun with an egg. My egg was a little runny, which I like. It was just ordinary. It sufficed... the bun was a little sweet which worked well for the sandwich.  The place is good enough. Kind of expensive for what it is.
2	be7pwES4vZkeD5hHCGLXA	Disappointed with our visit, the 'not quite the whole nine yards' were lukewarm and the portions varied in size. We were a large group who had booked a month in advance but they were totally unprepared for our party, even though the rest of the place was pretty quiet. The waiter came across quite rude at times and generally acted like he couldn't be bothered. Not a complete disaster as others enjoyed their breakfasts but overall felt this could have been a more pleasurable visit.
2	xp8lkjPolLwA0HXLfRf0wQ	Apparently this place has reopened in Surprise.  And it is now reflected on their website, which it didn't before.  I still wouldn't go there because I didn't like the food but maybe I caught them on a bad day.
4	7oVwQgoSzLWOEIek3IQ82g	I'm secure enough in my masculinity to unequivocally endorse this place.  Look past the shabby chic decor and the gossiping grandmas and you will find some great sandwiches and the best sugar cookie I've had in Phoenix.    A great meal in a great part of Mesa.  Now if only we could get more activity and life in that neck of the woods.
4	gWHTpl3REghqiSFGRTtUNA	Big bar in the heart of Tempe.  The guys tend to love it for the cheap Corona.  I like it for the atmosphere so long as it is not too packed with underaged college kids.  It is a pretty open space and it almost feels like you are in a warehouse.  The bartenders have heavy hands, which is always a plus when you are a vodka person, like I am.  Great place to go hang with your friends in your flip flops and tees.  Cool, chill, laid-back...just like I like it.
4	O45mWcZwxQc8jfRxeZ6FSw	This was our first visit to Rosati's. We were greeted by Courtney who was amazing, friendly and helpful with our order. Deep dish pizza's duration was about 45mins so order first before coming to the store. Pizza was delicious. We think it should be cooked a lil more. Next time, we'll have to get the smaller ones.
2	zadWar96USu6pDXTLDHKg	Incredibly average. Nothing to speak about. They ran out of the veal chop, which half of my table was planning on ordering (veal parm or veal with arugula) the meatballs were fine, the salad was all right, my lamb chops were probably the best thing ordered by my table of 10. The chicken and peppers were too spicy to enjoy, the pastas were sad. I got no feel of the original in Brooklyn and guess that location is full of ambiance and tradition. The Ceasers location is just another Vegas spot with nothing special to offer.
4	HBMJ8c8LCeiuKZ6kOcqXQ	If you're looking for pizza that doesn't sacrifice taste for price, head to Sardella's. Even their topping-naked cheese pizza has a good blend of flavor. If you go in on a Monday, you'll be happy to find most food half-price. It makes Sardella's a Monday-must for me, most weeks.  Their 2-slice and drink lunch special makes for a filling meal at the same pricetag as most pizza joints' single slices. My only complaint is that it isn't as fast as it could be, given its name. I'm willing to wait a few minutes for pizza if it's Sardellas, though. Order some garlic knots while you're waiting. They're don't skimp on the garlic.
4	aMLVs7GNMaCHUuwevNJZSg	They have a waitress here named Sheena who is totally delightful in every way.  The location is good and I had a couple of appetizer pizzas which were distinctive and tasty.  Not the best pizza I've ever had but very good indeed.  All I heard was that the food was amazing from everyone who has eaten there but I was not in the eating mood and so I don't have much more to offer you in the way of reviews.  But there's always sheena!
2	4KMhX8herbyq8pOwajkQA	Everyone at my work seems to like this place, and it's.... ok. But it's a bit too pricey for what you get.  They are supposedly famous for their rotisserie chicken, but to be honest I think that the stuff at Albertson's/Vons is better (and cheaper). In fact, even though rotisserie is supposed to help the fat drain away from the chicken, I nearly gagged on a gob of fat. Gross!  The food is supposed to be Mexican (or something) but it's pretty blah. There are no spices and the flavors are pretty much what a Midwesterner might interpret Mexican food to be. They insisted that the guacamole is made fresh, but when I asked for a batch that didn't contain tomatoes, they balked saying that they used all the avocados in the morning to make that day's guac. Uh, ok. That doesn't sound very fresh. Even Baja Fresh will give me a slice of avocado.   The salads are large and people seem to like that and it also seems to be the best deal in the place. The quesadillas are ok, but then again, it's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla that just has (rotisserie) chicken in it and cheese.
4	YNzyhVkp4EYlXr123REg	Tot's is awesome! I actually like it more than Pei Wei (which I like a lot). I just don't go as often since I don't live in Tempe anymore. But anyways, everything I have had here has been awesome. The sesame chicken, the orange chicken are amazing. I seriously don't think they have a bad item on the menu. Young is the guy that runs the place and is super nice. It is always super packed at night time. This is one of the best kept secrets in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. I hope they open up another store someday.
2	Tl2HN3bOKOPpvZQJ7vGjw	I went in to Carmines for a Chicken Parm dinner and a pizza. When i got home to eat , the chicken parm was dry and like rubber it tasted old it was horrable so threw it out and had a slie of pizza and that tasted like a burnt dejorno pizza. Any way i wouldnt recomend that place to any one just buy a frozen pizza and cook it yourself it would be better
4	aU8br1NfiMQG1LLTLmKA5A	Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.  I perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.  Overall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.
2	VzbOlIS1m2o0A9KWNi9lQ	Visited this place because of the restuarant.com coupon my brother had.   I printed one myself not knowing we already had one for our group. Needless to say I still have my coupon. Dont really want to go again even with a 25 dollar gift certificate.   The food is ok at best, I found stuff half the price and way better in flavor, texture and quality.   The shwarna didnt tatse like it came from the tradition spit, I could of fried my own beef/lamb at home way better.   The chicken was moist but bland.   Damn I miss Zankou chicken..
2	oMn9FBEugtdGqKhtnuhDqA	Maizie's Cafe & Bistro My girlfriend had just finished auditioning for the Phoenix Choir so I wanted to treat her to a meal. We like to try new things and especially local venues and since we go to Lux occasionally had noticed a few new spots just north of there. One of them is Maizie's Cafe & Bistro.  I should have gotten a sense that something was strange with this place when I called to make sure they were open. The woman on the other end seemed taken aback by this simple question. I then asked if they were any good and once again there was a hesitation.  We arrived at around 645 to a fairly packed restaurant which is always a good sign especially on a Monday night, right? However i was immediately surprised to see Three big screen televisions on each wall save the back one, presumably because this had a wine rack on it... I dont know about you but when a room that is at best 20' X 20' has three 42 inch TV's in it I call that a Sports Bar, and they had American Football on one and what the rest of the world call Football on the other. To offset this they did have the third TV set to the Food Network.  Our table was somewhat sticky and when our drinks arrived the coaster for the tea got stuck to the table and eventually peeled away. Troubling but I wanted to keep positive since this was a celebration. We ordered wine and a cheese plate and almost immediately were approached by another waitress wondering if we were ready to order. Very confusing.  The cheese plate was straight out of Home Economics. They could have gone to Safeway and put a better selection of cheeses together. I would go easier on them except that the ambience and prices are asking for the quality to be better than presented.  My girlfriend ordered the Tuna Salad and I got the Fresh Basil Pasta with Marinara. Now I know that one of the hip things to do is have eclectic dinnerware to set your restaurant apart from the rest but serving salads in mixing bowls that dont match the decor is very awkward. Throwing a few veggies in said bowl and then a heaping scoop of tuna mix is not an entree, its a lunch item. Same goes with the Marinara dish. This cacophony of salad items sauteed up and mixed with pasta and a decent Marinara sauce is once again lunch fare, not a $12 dinner entree.  Throughout the course of this dinner we had both waitresses coming up to us about every 5 minutes to make sure everything was okay. A little hint to good serving: if someone is in the middle of a sentence dont ask if everything is okay. This became very annoying and when I mentioned it to my party we were approached once again, as if they were trying to push the point.  Another feature of Maize's is that it has Free Wifi and posts this fact on its doorway. So we are also trying to be a Coffee Shop/Internet Cafe. So to add to the glow of Plasma screens all around a group of students sit next to our table and launch up three laptops, very romantic indeed.  The piece de resistance thought was when the florescent lighting from the outside awning kicked in halfway through the entrees and we were bathed in a brilliant glow of blandness. At this point we both broke down into laughter at the whole spectacle. The effect was a perfect way to end this experience.  Overall Maize's is a horribly confused concept with incredibly schitzophrenic tendencies. It wants to be everything to everyone. The look says it wants to be a wine bar, but the TV's confuse that aspect. The menu talks gourmet but the reality is that they are serving lunch fare, which has its place. The free wifi means you will be getting non diners which will only make the diners more uncomfortable. I get a sense of what they are trying to do which is a Cafe/Bistro, but in order to do that you need to scale down the ultra modern look of the place. From the outside it says dinner but the reality is that its a hangout.  To its credit it was close to full on a Monday evening so there seems to be some appeal.
4	fUeEQV6V5OGZaLOEjDzQEg	They didn't invent the chicken sandwich, they just made it better. Much better!  This location is right next to a McD's an Arby's and a couple of sub places, so it's always hopping busy. Never stressed, the crew here seems to do a solid job and they've yet to mess me up.  I don't want to look under the covers and find out if Chik-Fil-A is any healthier than McDonald's. I'm just going to continue in my intentional bliss that it's chicken and therefore it has to be better than anything that Mickey D's has to offer. La la la la! Not listening!  Best invention at the Fil-A? Waffle fries! OMG, perfection. I could eat these all day long.  One tip. I really can't stand that pickle on my chicken sandwich. Even if I take it off, the taste is still there. They'll make you a fresh one if you ask. I just always forget to ask. Argh!  Other than seeing Dave Thomas in the Wendy's commercials, the Chik-Fil-A "Cows" are the best fast food campain. Seeing them on billboards and in commercials with "Eat Mor Chikin" is always funny. Nicely done, guys!
2	hTPYwIyaFYQHlAPANtOpdg	Not a fan.  I prefer ground beef versus shredded beef tacos, but when I asked if that was possible, the waiter told me there would be a $4 upcharge.  Really?  My date ordered a margarita which was watered down, and the waiter didn't really seem too enthusiastic about making us feel welcome.  I will say that the portions were quite large (I couldn't finish mine) but the food was just "ok".
4	atRKMjEPtF2YacGPe9gTYQ	At breakfast John's has some of the best home fries in town. Their country ham is also nice and salty like it should be add good biscuits with eggs how you like them and you have a great breakfast; plus Jimmy is always ready with a smile and a hello. Fridays at lunch he serves an excellent fried chicken. Updated 9/2012 Jimmy is about to open up a new place on Carmel road in the space formally occupied by Carmella's, I look forward to eating there though Charlotte will sorely miss John's and Jimmy's great breakfasts.
2	j1v9RPXdEhNpc66hiRw	Walking in, I had no idea what we were getting in for.   It turns out that you pile meats, vegetables, nuts, fruits, and sauces from an extensive buffet line into a small bowl for the "chefs" who will fry it all up for you. Chicken, scallops, pork, beef, zucchini, carrots, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, mandarin oranges, pineapple, garbanzo beans, and a WHOLE lot more are available for the choosing. Plus over 30 sauces are available for mixing and matching.   When first approaching the stack of bowls, I noticed that they were all soiled. Icky! Not my idea of a good first impression. While satisfied with the choices, I found myself going back to my favorite standbys each time I filled a new bowl. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat.  The Cooking Method: Dudes take your bowl, slop it onto a large rotating flat grill (consistently too close to my neighbors pile, I might mention), and flip them until "finished". Meanwhile I'm waiting for my food to cook, I see significant pieces of my ingredients falling into the catch basin while they are being flipped. Dang! I wanted that piece of chicken in there!  I must admit that the crab rangoon were mighty tasty. My mom longed for shrimp, which they apparently only serve during dinner. They did, however, send out a funnel cake dessert to celebrate my mother's birthday which was nice.   BREAKDOWN: The food was ok. I like the idea of make-your-own stirfry. Atmosphere was way too corporate. Decent prices at lunch. Skived out by the messiness of the whole thing.   I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE WITH FOOD ALLERGIES!
2	Mn2ibj4HlLa0VHvw6aB8jw	Disappointing experience. Took a long time to get the food, and everything I wanted was not available and had to settle for something else. The person working the register had to go and check what was available in the back. Took way too long. I have been here once before and had a great experience, not sure if I'll come back.
2	9J9YTq8TPsOlRErey1mAg	This used to be one of my favorite places to go for sushi since it is relatively close to my house and the sushi was pretty good. I didn't go for quite a few months, and when I went back something happened. It was not as good as before. The rolls were much sloppier than I remember. The baked rolls had so much mayo on them they were damn near inedible.  I did enjoy a couple of the rolls still, the "what the heck" rolls jump to mind, but overall it was not a good meal. On top of that, the bill was about $75 for 2 ppl, no alcohol, and we left hungry due to not being able to eat half the food. Of course it wasn't noticed that we didn't eat our food, but that was expected with the comically bad service.  I'm done with this place. I'll have to venture out to one of the other thousands of sushi places around town next time.
4	BSkYL2GpyZX4b7QViIibkw	I love the vegan pizzas here. The last time I ordered it for my non-vegan fans and they loved it too considering they are fond of cheese and this pizza had vegan cheese. This is my go-to-place for pizza :)
4	SpC9s2az7KF3nGCXKzMjkQ	This particular Buffet Asia was very accommodating to our family reunion group of fifteen (kids included).  The fresh oysters on a half shell (available only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays) were very enjoyable and had my full attention.  It was a popular menu item in our party, and the round table we sat in had a majestic mountain of oyster shells when the bill came.  So popular in fact, that I can't even remember what else I ate there!  So if you like gulping raw oysters to your heart's (and stomach's) content, I would suggest trying this place out.  The oysters pay off the bill fairly quickly.
2	O3fWLR8I3ZAsWGqXA89QZA	Austin Yelper here... I was in Charlotte on business a few weeks back and was taken to Town for a nice dinner.  We stayed in the lounge area for about an hour near the bar, and had some pretty good wine.  The atmosphere was nice and the bartender was friendly.  After everyone arrived, we sat down... and it went quickly downhill.    I ordered a filet, medium rare, and kept making conversation.  The company was nice, so time flew by!  In fact, 2.5 hours flew by.  No food.  Finally, we realized that and complained... and our food came out pretty quickly afterwards... stone cold.  I hate sending food back, I really do... but for the amount of money that it cost and the fact that we waited a few hours for the food, I sent it back.  A few minutes later, they delivered the wrong entree to me, piping hot.  So, that went back as well.  The next steak that came out was extremely rare.  I'm pretty sure that the waiter went back and asked for my steak to be thrown on the grill for a few seconds, to be rushed out to me.  Since I was with clients and colleagues, and didn't want to make a scene, I ate the steak.  Boy... that was my biggest mistake of the night, because the next morning, I was sicker than I'd been in a long time.  Halfway across the country, trying to maintain composure in my meeting the next morning... let's just say that I was very glad to be getting on a plane to come home later that day!  It gets two stars for the excellent bar service and atmosphere.  The food and waiter service gets a big 0.
2	alygwgunL5FUrha4rN067w	So it's just a McDonald's.  So what?  Well, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) the are not all created equal.  I have been to this location several times.  The staff is friendly for a McDonald's, but I would say it takes roughly twice as long to get my food as it does at other locations.  I don't think I have ever received my food where there wasn't at least something left off of my tray, like a drink, or french fries.  There are so many McDonald's to choose from surrounding this one, I might keep on driving an extra mile or so and visit another location.
2	dKYmyuJqSwbQQ6LrPHWEA	I've had better.. but you can't beat the prices.  $3.99 for the midnight steak and eggs special is pretty much free.  $11.99 for the 14 oz prime rib or 11 oz Porterhouse is also definitely a deal.  I really liked my porterhouse but it wasn't the same as a full on steakhouse... admittedly this is probably due in part to the cheasy casino atmosphere vs. the typical steakhouse 'the room is so dark you can't see your food (or date)' atmosphere.
2	dzSyFEeptnEbjVE5HwQVbQ	If you come to Pittsburgh, you have to make a stop at Primanti Brothers. It has been featured on several travel and food shows like Man Vs. Food.  My friend took me here for dinner and each of us ordered a cheesesteak, which is considered the #2 best seller. This sandwich is HUGE! Mainly because of all the coleslaw and french fries piled high within the sandwich. The cheesesteak itself was okay and the meat looked processed. Not that great. However, the bread is nice and soft. I also ordered a pint of Yuengling on draft. Good beer...  If I do come back, I'm interested in trying the roast beef. It seems like this restaurant is hit or miss depending on what you order. Also the original location is in the Strip district while this location is near the University of Pitt campus, so lots of college students.
2	VDR8vijpcoblm2SlhKjZg	Food 3/5 Service 2/5 View - overrated  I was expecting a much better experience than I had at their previous restaurant 'steak' but it wasn't to be.  No hostess- understaffed in the dining room - took 45 min to get entrees with no apologies or explanation. By the way our party of four were the first customers of the evening.   Due to lack of variety on the menu kids and vegetarians may have difficulty finding something that sounds appetizing.   Restaurant is overpriced for the amount of food and the neighberhood (this isn't a strip hotel so stop charging as if it is).  The view is overrated. You look down on a strip mall parking lot and through 2 buildings to see the lights of Las Vegas.  Our steaks and side dishes were good.    The lack of quality service and understaffing seems to be a common thread in this restaurantuers disillusioned vision of a successful restaurant.   I see this restaurant soon becoming another statistic unless someone is brought in who understands the business of service.
4	uJOlVHw484ssnx2ww87XQ	This place is great!  We asked some locals where to eat and they recommended this place to us.  Great suggestion!  We were in Scottsdale for 4 days and this is definitely the best food that I had while we were there.  It feels like a NY Italian restaurant...dimly lit, dark-colored booths, sinatra in the background, and some NY-style servers.  I had the halibut and it was excellent.  My husband really enjoyed his lasagna as well.  We also had the tiramisu and the cannoli.  Both were very good, however I think the tiramisu was the best.  Our server was very friendly and very attentive.  They really take care of their customers and want to make sure that you have a good time.  If you're looking for a place to have some great food and to have an overall fun experience, check this place out.  After going there for dinner, I can understand why it's been around for over 30 years.
4	1yLiXecdpf4VbXPJmPo9g	I've been to Verona a few times now and always sing the praises of Michaels.  The burgers and hot dogs are just what you'd expect from a place like this and the custard is outstanding and there are plenty of flavors to choose from. My favorite is the caramel and cashew.  It is a nice place to stop by and just a short walk from my hotel.
2	u2ymFr9KthTpUDKOi8JLsw	Maybe I'm insane.  I'm afraid to even write this review... but... I did not like my food at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  I got the BBQ mix plate with short ribs, chicken, and beef.  The beef was so chewy and fatty that I couldn't chew through it.  The short ribs were gristly too.  The only decent thing was the chicken, but it wasn't anything special.  My fianc\u00e9 had the katzu chicken, which was just okay too.  Afterwards, I was disappointed, so I ordered a thai tea... I wanted it to be better than it was.  However, it had this funky aftertaste that I just couldn't get past.  Maybe I just had random a bad experience, judging by the other reviews.  Dunno.
4	b5XR5Ce6F2vi6Ftf0BtwQ	When you walk into an establishment and George Clinton is playing, you know it's going to be an interesting experience. After four years in this city I finally decided to give it a shot thanks to a coupon for a free entree + drink. I've always been curious about this place with it's eccentric outside decor, bars on the windows plus I like with things starting with F but are spelled out PH (however I hate when things that start with C are spelled out with a K but that's besides the point). I went right after work and there were only two other people in there....unheard of! Part of the reason I've never been is because the parking lot is full and I can't find anywhere to park so I was pleased to know I would finally get my Phat on. Even though the smell of Price's was in the air, I was still ready to try PB.  I got a chicken burrito to go and it was ready in less than 5 mins. It seemed like there were two people working that shift so I was surprised with the turn around time. When I got home and sat down to eat, I unwrapped the foil around the burrito and holy crap---it was bigger than my dogs head (see pics)! Boo ya! Super tasty and I didn't have to add any salsa or hot sauce. It was perfect just the way it was. It wasn't too dry but at the same time wasn't sopping wet and falling apart. For Mexican in a pinch, this will be my new go to spot....but only if I can find a parking spot.
2	9bJY7WZcSUZYCngRybkhDA	Meh.  Or in Spanish: Que meh!  Seriously, I've now been to both Dos Reales, and while you can chat it up in Spanish with the sweet staff that work there, and you can enjoy a decent margarita, this is Midwestern pseudoMexican food at its blandest and least inspired.  And fried and cheese-dunked.  Next.
4	Ctx9Npt6Z2sbBBEeQiMzNg	I had the pleasure of dining at East Boulevard Bar & Grill recently for lunch. This place is quite nostalgic for me even though it is now located a few blocks west of the old location on East in Latta Pavillion. As a kid my dad and I used to dine here with some frequency and I remember the salads, the round fries and the tuna melt - all still available. Lucky for me the Grill is even closer to my house! I also love that the new location allows the front windows to be raised, opening the restaurant up to the street, which is perfect for people watching and an urban touch not seen enough in Charlotte. Definitely a great place to have a beer and watch a game, too.  The menu includes lots of great appetizers (think nachos, wings and quesadillas among other items) sandwich options including the popular oven roasted grinders, a French dip and a Reuben, burgers and salads. The below fish tacos are another option. Entrees, including fried shrimp, grilled or blackened fish, pot pie and fish and chips are also available. If you haven't tried East Boulevard Bar & Grill you definitely should! I look forward to returning soon to try more menu items.
2	xW77irOciIdJl8Fh61h4fg	We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.  Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - saut\u00e9ed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans. A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading "Mediocre". We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty.
2	piRZdTELebEEaNnT2PpJg	We ordered a NY steak and an omelette. The steak was too well done, and as tasteless as the omelette. Very weak food and not worth the price. Good music and good ambiance, so it may be good for drinks.
2	jBaClWyRUOAQXFeRMlB0Lg	EHHH...  My friends came to Vegas and wanted to try this place out because they had coupons for it. I expected it to be blah, since I checked the reviews of the place before hand. I ordered their chicken sandwich, which was grilled (and BURNT AND REALLY TOUGH/HARD ON THE ENDS OF THE BREASTS!) Oh my gosh! It made me full though, since I didn't eat anything that morning and afternoon. The only thing I ate good here was the curly fries (and the honey mustard...and definitely the dill pickle....and my unsweetened ice tea)  Oh btw.......you have to buy a small water bottle here...which is a $1...and they give you a cup with ice....  There is a happy hour from 4-6pm...$10 all you can drink Bud, I believe....They also have this HUGE pitcher of beer which is great for a group of friends...(forgot the price, but it's very affordable!) You can also play beer pong here too!  The waitresses were dressed in skimpy cheerleading outfits, which many were not very tasteful in. Don't eat outside unless you want to hear a load of noise during your meals, since it's right across from that performing arts stage with acrobats! It's a bit quieter inside, even if the sports games are on. It could get very LOUD though when there's a big game!
4	fOkLbJEuYjjtjmlCzTGbwA	This location always turns out to be really convenient because it's attached to a BP gas station.  It's really cool when you can fill up your tank, buy a few snacks and pick up lunch or dinner.  The location is very clean and the staff is professional and always courteous.  The only confusing thing about the setup, is that the condiments are located around the corner in the dining room near the soda machine.  One note for chocolate lovers:  If you're a big fan of the chocolate turnovers like I am; you'll want to get there before 9:30 pm, because they have a tendency to run out of those pretty early.
4	KV4a1jQnu85TZvb9qwYiQ	I have been here a few tomes but only for lunch.  I have always had the chicken panzanella, and it is quite yummmy.  Also at lunch the prices are really reasonable   I think at night time this place is yup city, but they do have a wonderful outdoor patio on top of the restaurant that's cool.
2	tmnp51XmtMzOkE0tVyncg	The slices are huge and they get the crust right but the flavor and smells are purely generic. The taste was absolutely bland, like something that you give to small kids and I was starving at the time! The experience turned me off from eating pizza for months, and I love pizza!  They should use better cheese but most of all they should learn how to give some taste to that tomato sauce.
2	uP44p1p26fppzzViBg	Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a "sprinkling of parmesan cheese". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember.
4	CfzorUtWPOGTpZ2GeYpjEg	We have been wanting to try the "new and improved" Lenny's for a while now. Having a lazy, relaxing Saturday we decided to give them a try. You order at the counter, take a seat and they bring your order out for you. The new diner style joint is clean and efficient with self serve Pepsi machines, which is kind of a  negative for us..we are a Coke only family, but hey they have Dr. Pepper and ice tea, sweet & unsweetened for non-Pepsi drinkers.  I ordered a #1 Ranch style with cheese (a single patty burger with lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo..lots of mayo), the husband ordered #2 (double patty)  Ranch style with bacon & cheese, no tomato, the child ordered a hot dog with ketchup.   Food came out fast and hot. The burger was...well ok. Not great, not bad either, the cheese was melted and gooey which is a plus and they use red onion and Aunt Hattie's buns..another plus. Fries are frozen variety with the addition of a seasoned salt, I like greasy fries and these weren't, not a bad thing to most though. The all beef hot dog was average size on a very fresh seeded bun.   This Lenny's has a lot to offer for someone on a budget. They sell ice cream too, but we found it a little over priced unlike the burgers and dogs. Dinner for 3 was around $18..not bad. Food was good and we would definately go again some day, but nothing really wowed. Next time I want to order one of the specialty burgers like the Mexican or Cowboy. I don't like that they charge $.30 for a very small cup if you want actual Ranch for the burger or fries..the same price if you want cheese sauce.  I also didn't like the fact that you have to have a key to use the restroom but there isn't a sign to state it, only a sign that says "restrooms for customers only"..if a kind lady wouldn't have approached me and told me I needed a key I probably would still be standing there thinking someone was taking a very, very long time.
4	gANicZL0X9dSdYsZ0kQw	This is an old-school family run pizza joint reminiscent of early 70's Pizza Huts. It is a great place to relax after work and have a traditional American Pizza.   I don't know much about the lunch buffet, but the Pizza we ordered for dinner was delicious.  I love to support local joints like this.
2	i9gnajDmTBMXtIulih7ATw	Distinctly tepid soup, an eclectic car-crash menu, and friendly but slow service. This is not the recipe for a happy lunchtime.  Overall, we said: "the Slug & Lettuce wasn't great. They absolutely, categorically need to chop their menu at least in half, if not further than that. They have eight different burger options, sitting next to a similar number of curry options, sitting next to a broad range of pasta options, and from what I could see, none of it looked too appetizing. They need to focus on a much smaller number of dishes, and try to inject some quality. For now, I couldn't recommend the place."
4	TgDWaEwr3Bwh16XgvcdFjA	Went here for the first time recently. It was a typical chain place, but very good. I had the chicken canneloni and it was excellent. We didn't have to wait long for our food, the waiter was friendly and quick. However, we were seated near the open kitchen. At first I thought this would be a good idea, because I enjoy watching people cook. Then I started listening to various conversations going on between the waitstaff. I could not help but notice one particular waiter running around asking the others if they have ever seen the movie "Waiting". Then he would giggle. The members of the staff clearly had a little more intelligence and either pretended not to hear this kid or just blankly stared at him and walked away. If you have seen "Waiting" you know that you don't want to hear a waiter talk about it. Luckily, our waiter had nothing to do with this. But overall, good place. Don't know if I will go running back right away, but we will keep in our rotation.
2	dPtbLtgpswsoIfuUvueJ3w	so i just came back from my 1st visit to sami's gyros.  and i gotta say....  MEH about sums it up. i might go back but that's because the chicken med sandwich was good after one bite.  i'm hopeful there are other things to choose that i'll enjoy more than my meal, however i ate the steak sandwich and tho it looked good, it was without any moisture, the meat as well as the sandwich itself.  i then read on the wall menu for any missing extras, and saw none, perhaps they could offer something or include some kind of sauce, or condiment to this sandwich.  the fries tho given plenty of them, were also dry, and basically unsalted, so not so much there either.  humus was ok, as a side, but i'd go elsewhere if i wanted the good stuff.
4	ri0luquHzgjoE9x5jADcA	I am going to rate this place high for the Cubano sandwich, which was packed with good pork and ham . . . but especially for the Espresso, best I've had since my trip to Havana in '97. And at $2 a demi-cup, well I had three . . .  great fuel for a late night on the town. My partner recommends the black bean soup and the avocado salad , which was a beautiful presentation of one dead ripe Forida avocado (the big ones) sliced, face down on the half shell, perfectly peeled with a lemon garnish.  Excellent.  The service, however, was crap . . .  I had to go to the bar to find my waiter who was engaged in conversation with two other gentlemen . . . in other words, the Espresso was as good as Havana and the service was on par with what the State provides on the Island.
2	GHkgcOkEAYLBbVJBqV2SA	You know the saying, "You get what you paid for"? Well, that's just it. Not the best quality. Their meats were dry, vegetables and other platters were over cooked and some looked like they were sitting out for a while.
4	spA9jhm3vk85dFQAIrVw	Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one.
2	K2Jpujbijajcdmh1t6CQ	This place is either hit or miss. The first time I was here my soba was soo salty that I couldn't finish my noodles, and I'm a girl that loves her noddles. I came back again, and got the curry and it was really pretty decent. I friend ordered the pad thai, and I know its not authentic, but there was something in the sauce that made me think, wow, maybe this place isn't as bad as I thought.   I went back earlier this week to get my own pad thai and was disappointed once again. I don't know if its the change in the moon cycle, the way the wind blows, or which chef is making the food, but it totally stumps me how this place can be so on and off. Overall, more off times than on, so I'm going with 2 stars.
2	hOffbjSyRUvanxkyp1msPg	Like the previous reviewer - i found the pizza to be good tasting and it came with a gigantic salad for the lunch special.   However the service stinks.   We waited a while getting in because there wasn't a hostess at the desk.  She sat us in a nearly empty restaurant (we were there around 11:30am).  She said, "Bread will be right out."   or at least thats what we thought she said.  It turns out she must have said "Brett will be right out." as that was the name of our waiter.  It also turns out (because we asked) that they have a policy of only bringing out bread if you ask for it.  This seems like a stupid policy, if they want to cut costs by not just automatically bringing it out, they could just offer it and the people who don't want it could say no.  Or just take it off of their service all together.  Having some sort of secret handshake to get it just seems odd.  Maybe if we had asked for the free beer, that would have worked... who knows?
2	JNmcoI6KLQiXB9FEEKHXA	This place was awful!!! We are from Orlando and we are camping up here. After driving all day we were starving and wanted something quick and easy. The service was SLOW. It took forever for my husband to get a beer. The pierogies tasted like the frozen ones I buy. We ordered those as an appetizer but it came out about a minute before the pizza. The pizza was undercooked and the meatballs on it were dry and over cooked. I saw a big piece of what looked like cheese but it turned out to be a big piece of raw dough!! Our waitress was not friendly at all. I am thinking we should have went next door to the Chinese place! It had better reviews anyway!!
4	byf3RTAjImLgj20CbHhgA	I was in town from San Francisco for business and admittedly leery about seafood in Wisconsin. It was, however, a delightful meal.  The decor, the service, the ambience. But the food ... it was really very good. Well worth the prices.   Highly recommended.
2	Vd3gKTknKgwD4wUgyCbXyA	I went here based on the reviews on yelp. That's why I was surprised at how typical and generic the food was here. It's not that the food was bad I just wouldn't describe it as standing out from any other typical Chinese takeout food. I actually didn't see the Chinese menu mentioned in the reviews until on my way out of the restaurant - perhaps you have to ask for it?  it was posted on the window so I might go back and try something from that menu. Otherwise the food was very typical American-Chinese takeout fare. Our dishes had one-dimensional sugary sauces on them. The fried rice was pretty bland as were the fried eggroll and other fried things that came with the meal. I might try it again to see if other food choices are any better but otherwise I don't see dining here again over any other place.  The waitress was very nice and the vibe of the restaurant was casual. As for  improvements besides the food,  they might consider serving tea with the meal and possibly changing the music.
2	hSQKZfn2zDBEER2hVLecw	The food is Okay. Not great, not terrible. But I think for what they are charging it should be better than okay. Also the tofu tastes wierd. I think it could use more flavoring. The orange chicken is very spicey, almost too spicey to not even enjoy it. The sweet&sour is good.
2	t5Zw01yhcdy2C8jOOFN0g	You know you're broke when you even think about eating this. Marinara sauce tastes like it's cut with salsa, and the pizza crust tastes like it was brushed in margarine. Questionable all around, but it's even CHEAPER than Little Caesar's, so do you really have a right to complain?
2	GOdioVtR7Cg1MZQDZK5WA	We headed back to the One Eyed Dog for some fish & chips with friends the other day and were very disappointed.  It seems that the One Eyed Dog is no longer and now the location is Clancy's Pub. The temporary sign does have a shamrock logo (which we thought may have indicated it was now an Irish bar - nope) and also reads Pizza & Grill.  While the decor is still similar and many of the staff have been retained the big change that disappointed us was a completely new menu. Gone are the English specialties such as shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers beans & chips, Scotch eggs, etc. They've even done away with their excellent fish and chips preparation. To be fair, we didn't try the new twist. One of the big draws for us last visit was an interesting English menu with great execution.  Now the menu is quite bland and the execution wasn't great either.  Our table had a BLT (not bad), a burger and a couple of wraps. Nothing stood out. Nothing super interesting. No raves for any of the food. The menu now consists of burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps, pizza, etc. The one thing that comes to mind is that they have tater tots.   They've also eliminated some of the interesting beers (Boddington's, etc.) that were also a draw for us.  The staff were nice as before but we probably won't be back.  While some of it may be due to the change and the newness of the menu, I'd rather hit Zipp's next door whose execution of a similar menu is far better (in my opinion).  Might be great for some.  Just not our gig.
4	hpqaQWP17NSg25tQH5DMnw	Good tasting cheap takeout.  I enjoyed the house chicken, sesame chicken, rice and lo mein.  The crabpuffs and springroll were also good.  Lo mein could have used less sprouts but that is my only complaint.
4	TeVP3xtaihgij44WKQzNQQ	Ahh, this place is refreshing.  Smells like italy as soon as you walk in.. (ok, never been, but that's how it better smell).  We had lunch there, a chicago style italian beef and it was fantasic.  It's also a market, so, needless to say, I enjoy grabbing a quick bite in places that are a bit unconventional.. and, as I sat there eating, I looked at some italian antacids that kind of looked like screws or something that were bottled on the shelf next to me.. :/  Anyway, I also bought premade cannoli shells, which were a bit pricey, but to make my own it would have probably cost more..  AND they had the filling to purchase as well..  This was pretty neat to me.  Really though, this place has anything and everything you would need to make any italian dish, and the services was exceptional..
4	nepzZXhFhmduArfv2zQiBA	"Here they come on the run with a burger on a bun And a cold dab of Coke on the side, Oh, your taste they will tickle with a cold dill pickle, And all of their potatoes are fresh fried fried fried. Their burgers can't be beat 'cause they grind their own meat. Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind....."  My apologies to the Flintstones, but somehow Mr. K's reminds me of that jingle sung by Wilma and Betty. Mr. K's may actually have been around since I was a kid, so I guess that's why I'm reminded of the way burger joints used to be.   That's the way Mr. K's still is. Burgers that taste like beef, crispy fries with a slight taste  of salty burger-grease, onion rings with real onions inside (if you can't make up your mind, order "frings" and you'll get a mixed order of rings and fries.... heavenly), and homemade shakes. The cholesterol might stop your heart, but at least you'll die happy! Mt. K's is a piece of Americana to enjoy today and remember for a lifetime.
4	PEjU830q67iNGh6EqIbujQ	Great hole in the wall bar.  The atmosphere is inviting and not your typical Charlotte cookie-cutter crowd.  Places like this are the heart of Charlotte.  You will not see any pink polos here!  Go here if you are looking for a stiff pour and some authentic greasy bar food.
2	6baVKLRLqDJLLf3boTJQ	I've tried this joint a couple of times now and feel very comfortable skipping it from now on. Cavernous and sooo noisy. Not very cold beers served with no head at all. I mean, come on, we're in Wisconsin, right? Super gross cheese curds, which is the one offense this aficionado cannot forgive. What are those, Velveeta?? We never saw a server and went to the bar to order.. so not cool, especially given the large platters that were never cleared from our table.   Yup, amateur. When we can play darts and watch large screen tvs anywhere, you're going to have to work a little harder to keep the grownups around.
2	Bk986doREYy0lKpOm245g	This place is definitely mediocre and I agree with all the reviews  that deem this little hole in the wall 'overpriced,' because it really is. I ventured over to this spot last night for a quick bite to eat--I was craving spicy salmon rolls like you wouldn't even believe--and I left feeling unsatisfied. Firstly, $6.75 for a spicy salmon roll (with 5 dinky pieces) is really unacceptable. I mean I don't even think it was made fresh and it was not (I repeat, not) spicy in the least bit. Although I must admit the Chicken teriyaki was good--fresh vegetables, delicious sauce--I feel that you could get the same thing at a food court in a mall somewhere. Hell, even 'Teriyaki experience' at Centre Eaton serves up a good teriyaki stir-fry.  The service was bizarre. The waitress did not speak a word to me--from the moment I  walked in (she motioned me to an open table) to the time I left, it was mostly grunts and head nodding. I usually go out of my way to say 'oh, thanks' or 'how are you,' but it would have been like talking to a brick wall with this one. She was a piece of work.   The decore is very mundane. Its basically like title flooring with a splash of this nasty blue paint on the walls. The tables are wobbly and the chairs are IKEA. Nothing wrong with IKEA but for $25 for one roll and a teriyaki I expect at least a little effort on presentation. I should've known--if there are only two other diners in the joint at 6 pm its probably not where you want to spend your precious sushi dollars.   Even Sushi Crescent--an AYCE place--was infinitely better in taste, price, and quantity. Go figure!
2	BMBYsk0usUXZERXQeePy0g	Food is alright for a late night place. Chicken and gyro meat was a bit on the dry side. The falafels were cleverly-designed, elongated chickpea logs. This makes them easier to eat and more whimsical than traditional falafels. The service was polite and friendly. My primary complaint is the clientele. For dine in 2 stars, carry out 3.
4	PQJk0XP4KzKjHhq4mfew	I love the food!! Love for the environment.. eh.. not so much.  Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant "Kazimierz." Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.  So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.  Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!  The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness.  Since I liked the food, I'll give this place 4 stars. However, I wish I could see what I was eating. Thank goodness I took a picture of what I was ingesting.   The service and atmosphere is more like 3 stars.
2	PvLejp1bhcSEpSXhHyGcOg	Judging by some of the previous reviews, opinions of Biblos are mixed to say the least.  So, here's my ten pence worth...  In my first years of uni here, Biblos rapidly rose to being one of my favourite places to eat.  This was no doubt helped by the two for one deal on main courses - on one occasion, I ordered two main courses for myself!  The food has been great each time I've been, and I wasn't aware of these apparent health issues there.  It's something I'll bear in mind if I go there again.  The one thing that does annoy me each time is the poor service.  This has prevented Biblos from scoring any higher than 2 stars in my reckoning.  Each time I have been, the waiting staff have not been to the standard I would expect.  They have either been too busy behind the bar, or overstretched by the amount of orders to take and food to serve.  It was quite often the case that food would take an hour to arrive, or longer on occasion.  This was repeatedly frustrating to me, and means that my desire to go back there again is now tempered.  On the flip side, the decoration inside is very nice, and so if you are content to look at the surroundings whilst waiting for your food, you may be able to cope.
2	DUNq3b4WoJYndA5qucWsIQ	I came here at 7am to get breakfast. It's freshly made, but that means a 10 min wait for a egg, cheese and ham toasted breakfast bagel?! I almost finished my coffee by the time the order was ready. This was only 3 customers ahead of me. Imagine what this place would be like at lunchtime?  The service is pretty stern for this hour of the morning, except one lady who made an effort to greet people with a smile and send them on their way. But the lady who handles the order and delivery to customers is fierce!
2	joY1AuUNjx0sVXa1ka13eg	I stopped by here yesterday with my fiance for a late afternoon pick me up before heading to a show.  The "restaurant" is located in a food court area of Caesars and other than literally having a wall of pastries, there is not much else to say about it appearance wise. After looking over the menu I decided to go with a small iced coffee since even that cost $4!  Ahh Vegas inside casinos, how though rip us off.  One nice thing was that they had actual cream for the creamer which was nice and so I added some cream to my 12 oz cup of coffee (probably 6 oz of coffee with the ice) and away I went.  It ended up being a pretty decent cup of coffee as it was strong and went well with the cream.  The bottom line for me is that I probably would not stop by here again in the future.  The coffee was good but if I have the chance, I would love to find somewhere thats a little more reasonable price-wise.  I do realize that I may not be able to do that though, especailly if I am inside a casino.
4	DalVifBNIXPq07695ltg	I love eating at los betos. My favorite is their chicken enchiladas which I get constantly. They fill my tummy up and taste delicious with their lettuce and chicken and red sauce.  When im not in the mood for enchiladas my second favorite item is the green chili burrito which has just enough kick before its overpowering. This place is definitely a hole in the wall but isn't that what makes a dingy little Mexican joint so awesome? The only reason im giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because their food isn't consistent some days their food is really good and other days its just alright.
4	xkDmJJ5Dxv9vPJnbsjhqjw	I miss Rosita's.  I've not lived in Arizona in a few years, so perhaps it's gone downhill.  However, their chips and salsa were always fantastic.  I could get full just from that.  And their chimichangas were to die for.  I always went during lunch, as it was just up the road from work.  It was cheap, quick, good service, and tasty for the price.
2	eofwyGnc2oQm6tZNZ8Xztw	To be fair to this restaurant, you need to rate it according to the type of restaurant that it is. To the American readers, I would compare L'Academie to a better version of Cheesecake Factory. It was loud, the service a bit uneven but the food was solid. I think that it is a perfect restaurant for groups or for a dinner date on a budget. It's Bring Your Own Wine and there is a good selection of fairly affordable dishes.  I had a plate of mussels and fries. The mussels were big and clean. The broth was tasty and the fries homemade (so was the mayo... I think)  Overall, I'm not gonna be dreaming about this restaurant but it was pretty good... for what it is!
2	ym8uE89uCLsGj5Pd0abMUQ	Ok, it's a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel so I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be particularly authentic. Actually check that, there's a Chinese place in the Palace Station hotel that really is quite good.   Anyway, dinner started off well enough when they brought out fried wonton strips and sweet and sour (I'm a sucker for fried wonton skins!). We shared the wonton soup, yang chow fried rice and crispy garlic chicken. The fried rice was really bland and the crispy garlic chicken had an overly sweet sauce that could easily have been orange chicken, general tso's chicken or any other goopy sugar sauce covered chicken. The wonton soup was the best dish of the night with lots of meat, veggies and huge meatball sized wontons.  Service was alright, but it seemed like a pretty slow Monday night. Prices are in the $10-$15 range for most dishes, which is not as bad as I was expecting for a hotel restaurant. I'd probably head across the street to PF Chang's before I come back here.

We ordered the first time and asked for delivery and they agreed.  But none of us knew where the other was -- it took the poor guy 40 minutes to deliver it to us and he just kept apologizing.  Dude - our fault for sure!  Their Moo Shoo Pork is to die for and their fried rice is fresh and yummy.  When I tell you we order $75 in Chinese take-out, you can imagine how much food that it.  We've had their honey Garlic Chicken, Almond Chicken, Beef Lo Mein (a total fav), both pork and beef fried rice, and the soups.  One thing we had that we weren't nuts about was the orange beef, not bad, just didn't love it.   As for appetizers, we LOVE their crab puffs - and i want some now as I'm typing.  Had the egg roll, and eh, it was just an eggroll.  I would definitely recommend New Asian Kitchen to anyone who likes fresh and tastey Chinese food.  I keep telling them they should open up a location in Desert Ridge - heck, we'd probably keep them in business all by ourselves!
2	zGivPpMYdpnsQd5CfAitIw	I have often been delighted with the amazing bread and sandwiches i have received at great harvest on Bonanza, so I was thrilled to find that there was a great harvest near my job in Summerlin.  Although it is a bit out of my way, i decided to make the 15 minute drive to this location enthusiastic for a delicious home baked lunch.    I was however, less than pleased with the service i received. not only were the prices higher at this location, odd, but the sandwich took much longer to make ( and was made incorrectly, despite the fact that great harvest has you write down your specifications).   the bread on my sandwich was falling apart and i had to basically each my food with my hands, it was disgusting.  i was also not offered to sample the bread of the day which i had in mind to purchase. I did notice other clients come in and be immediately attended and offered to sample multiple slices of bread and engage in conversation before walking out and leaving without ordering anything.   Sadly i left without buying the bread of the day and will probably never return to this branch. Please learn to treat all of your guests with the same amount of courtesy, especially these who actually make purchase and come in with faithful client cards half full of stamps.
4	4axui8GqGfFayL1PsM2GQ	So weird that this place gets such bad reviews. My coworkers and I always come here when we are in town for CES. We have always had good food and good service. I am from LA and we eat at korean bbq joints all the time. And this one is just as good as the ones we go to in LA. I've never done the all you can eat. I've always just gone there for dinner. As long as we are forced to go to CES every year, we will always go to this place for korean bbq.
4	oBZH60QVzOUQwBzXoZcFpQ	A friend told me about this place, after asking on Facebook  where to get a good breakfast. From the outside it looks like nothing to write home about as well as the inside, that's were the bad stops. the employees and server had such wonderful attitudes, they treated me like I was a long lost friend coming for visit. I had the Southern biscuit and gravy and it was lip smacking good, their Bacon is thick cut and cooked just right, not that wimpy flimsy stuff you get elsewhere. I will return, funny things is I live about 6 miles away and i would I  drive by all the time and I never once stopped. Like they say never judge a book by its cover.
2	1uHacIfmAmxeQJPG2NOnFw	This is a quintessential Crescent street experience: high on flash, low on content.   My pastas were alright, though nothing you could not do at home with a sauce bought at the grocery store. The white wine was way too cold when they brought it and very overpriced for such an average pinot grigio.   Places like those have their purposes: you can take a large group there as it won't bother anyone if you are noisy, and people's expectation regarding food are usually low. However, if you want to treat yourself to a good meal in good company, go somewhere else.
2	T21X0KrZsq2apH7r9G6qA	J'aurais pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 attribuer une note de deux \u00e9toiles et demi \u00e0 cette cr\u00eaperie bretonne, mais je ne pouvais pas me r\u00e9soudre \u00e0 lui en octroyer trois. Non pas que leurs cr\u00eapes soient infectes, mais elles sont dans les faits tr\u00e8s ordinaire et on est en droit de s'attendre \u00e0 beaucoup mieux d'une cr\u00eaperie, d'autant plus qu'elle clame \u00eatre bretonne. Les cr\u00eapes sont beaucoup trop \u00e9paisses et ressemblent \u00e9trangement \u00e0 celles qu'on peut manger pour d\u00e9jeuner dans un resto de quartier. Aussi, j'ai choisi une cr\u00eape au jambon, et j'ai accompagn\u00e9 le tout d'un cidre qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, dont je ne me souviens plus de la marque, mais qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bon. Finalement, la facture n'\u00e9tait pas trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e, quoique beaucoup trop en prenant en consid\u00e9ration la qualit\u00e9 des cr\u00eapes servies.
2	OhwS6oqCaC9LJepk0Cb5AQ	Moishe's, I hate to say this, I wanted to love you like I did 10 years ago when I last ate at your restaurant, but sadly I was disappointed.   The room and ambience is great, sides were ok but my meat was just so-so and the waiter got my order wrong (my dining companion asked for medium, me for rare but seeing as we got different cuts of beef we couldn't simply switch and I don't believe in throwing out food so I ate it anyway). At the end of the day I come to a restaurant for the food and after this meal I think this will unfortunately be my last visit.   Please, bring back the quality of the Moishe's I fondly remember.
4	EgaCB24KQ1esBMf4ihgVog	I've eaten at this place and I've gotten carryout. The carryout service can be a bit slow late on weekends. My only complaint, however, is that sometimes they don't put enough barbecue sauce on the wings -it's like they are careless about dipping the wings in the sauce and half the wings may have nothing on them.  I've taken to asking them for extra sauce on the side (even though it's always lukewarm), but sometimes they'll screw up the order and give me sauce on the side but none on the wings!  Egads.  I eat a mostly vegetarian diet these days but if I wanted wings, I'd still come back here. I'd just check the order before leaving! ;-)   OH- I should add that they have a TV-based series of trivia games that patrons can play from their tables using these electronic units.  Some people are pretty addicted to these games; there are different ones on different days of the week, and all of the BWW restaurants across the country are ranked live on the screen.  It's kinda fun, if you like that.
4	KZ3a2F10P2slUtsBagNnQ	Really nice place. Kind of expensive (over $100 per couple with the advertised special,) but a decent place for a romantic date night or fun with friends. The cheese fondue is great, but the meat in the entree is lacking any kind of flavor. The dessert is delicious with a plate full of cakes and fruit to dip into chocolate, with an offering of different chocolates to choose from.
2	4p7Zm9NrSwTlQzIVVwpCSA	US Egg located on Greenway.  The service was good, no complaints there.  I ordered the Durango breakfast burrito.  It was delivered in a 'gravy boat.'  I soon realized why, it was soupy.  The wrap was wet and laying in water.  The taste was okay but, nothing over the top.  When you walk into a breakfast place at 7AM on a Saturday morning and you're one of the few people there, it's a sign...
4	BLPtZKTu0LoSAavquHuzwg	I am so tired of Subway, so a couple of weeks ago I started looking on Yelp for other sandwich places. Last week, I visited Steve's Crazy Sub.  It isn't that far a drive from work for me and I was in the mood for a real submarine. I ordered the 12 inch Super Sub with ham, hard salami, capacolla, pastrami, turkey, provolone cheese with the works, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, vinegar/oil and yellow mustard.  All for $6.05 plus tax.    Taking the sub to go, I drove to a local park.  Sitting in the shade of the picnic area, I opened up the white paper wrapper and took in the Super Sub vista.  It looked so good and tasted even better.    It was so good, that later in the week I went back and ate another Super Sub just to check if they made them tasty every time. They do and I will be back to try out the other subs on the menu.
4	5fXLXUqyOMZpgEDoPECMQ	I like to visit Ishi every now and then to remind myself of my college days at UNCC. I almost always go for their great sushi creations which I always recommend to others. So far they're one of my favorite sushi joints in the free world.  I'm not a huge fan of their new location. The spacious emptiness of the old Taiyo restaurant really kills some of the intimacy that they had in their old corner location of the shopping center. They're so popular that I'm often surprised to see them so empty when I stop in. I do just chock it up to the larger floor plan and imagine they get hit hard by UNCC students on Thursday nights.  Sushi is the one way to go when you come here. You won't be disappointed! My biggest recommendation would have to be the Kamikaze roll. As always the staff is friendly. I do wonder if the rumors about management taking the servers' tips were ever true though.
4	XYF9uhAZ22nNXwZlklqtQ	By far the best Chinese restaurant in the valley. I'm from the east coast and you really wouldn't think that Chinese food would be regional in the US...with that said, the food out here is different than the east coast. I have been on the quest for a decent General Tso's chicken and this place has it. It is as close to what I am used to that I have been able to find. The service is reliable and friendly. I really don't have anything bad to say. I took a star away because a couple times they messed up my Carry out order. Just check it before you leave the parking lot and it wont be an issue ;-)
2	LmsZpW4QVPDgufKObor7qg	I really want to like Dozen. The proprietors are nice people, they have convenient locations, and their shops have an inviting, albeit busy feel to them.   I simply do not like their cupcakes. I find them overly frosted and the cake dry. This is applicable, unfortunately, to their other baked goods as well.   Two great things about Dozen. First, their brunch is fantastic. I love the quiches! Second. If you ask, they will make you special treats for your dog (I have bought pup-cakes on more than one occasion!)   These redeeming qualities do not make up for the sub-par baked goods. Also, some of their better brunch items are sold out after a very short time. I might go back... but only for the brunch.
2	xitevYmt39bFOeDfNLm0Vg	Theres not enough meat in the pho, u can get double the amount of meat in Chinatown, LV. Too much cinnamon and star anise in the broth. I'd much rather drive the distance to Chinatown to get my money's worth. They better change that or they won't be in business long.
2	wsL6xjTh8VTpDH1e85pwfw	Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasn't fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a 'fine dining' japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - it's fantastic and worth every penny.
4	hO0jzxvXhEvkC5MR6c7eRA	i love the Slices!!!!!!!! it's not open as late or as often as the Mill Ave. Slices, but after a night at Axis-Radius (yes, folks, remember that), i would always steer my party to this late-night jem. they always had a line straight out the door and the smallest eating arrangement. i liked that during the summer, their Parmesan cheese was put in the fridge with the bottled soda. what i don't like is parking. and what i dislike more than that is being closed on sunday.
2	MYA5nNvd0Xg290eQBtpVxQ	Very disappointing taste... Presentation of dishes is very bad... Ambience is Ok... Service is average...  This is in comparison to so many indian restaurants we ate in US. Dine date : 2012Feb10 Hope they improve it soon.  Full Details below: 4 of us went, 2 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarians Pakoda - Made of only Potato not cut properly. Generally we expect Onion/Gobi.  Chicken Tikka - Tastes good, juicy and nicely marinated. Lacks presentation. The onions provided are not seasoned and are White Onions. Specifically order for more spicy(hot) but we got it very less spicy dish.  Chicken Biryani - Specifically ordered for less spicy and its too spicy(hot). Has lot of peas and less chicken. No coriander added. Chicken is well cooked but the dish lacks many ingredients. Doesn't feel like a biryani.  Mutton Biryani - Specifically ordered for less spicy and I was sweating heavily by the time I left. Again too many peas and less Mutton. Mutton is tender and cooked well, but the dish as such does not have that biryani taste.  Vegetable Biryani - Except for Potato and Peas, there are no more vegetables. C'mon... at the least we expect a couple of Gobi and carrot pieces.   The side of Raita provided is horrible. There are no cut onions/tomato/coriander/green chili in it. Its plane yogurt mixed with lots of water.  Dal Makhani - Nice taste and proper quantity.  Basmati Rice - Not properly cooked. Is cooking plane rice so hard..??  Soft drinks - they do refill it, but the soda doesn't have proper soda in it.... its like as if  you leave a coke bottle open for 1/2 hour and drink it.  Pricing - Reasonable and equivalent to other Indian restaurants.   Service - Good. The waitress is very presentable, doesn't bother to give us choices. Also doesn't bother to tell our specific needs to the cook. Seriously..?? I can have that in a buffet or in a fast food joint..  Finally my friend giving us the treat, decided he will take us to a better restaurant again. Everyones disappointed.
2	cfvIV8ZFrzFtkWYbGRruA	Went in there recently to grab a coffee and my colleague grabbed breakfast. Her food was cheap and looked awesome. I was really excited to try it myself. I came back the next morning with my wife and child. This was a Sunday morning at 8AM. The sign on the door said they were open from 7AM-11AM on Sundays. I was terribly disappointed, and my rating will stay low until I get a chance to go back and try again. Maybe they won't be closed on one of the biggest breakfast mornings of the week (especially when the sign in the window said they would be open!)
2	VKlb6hFHhfxMRlwrbf5tgQ	give them 2.5 stars but i am forced to round and i rounded down. Service good, dogs decent but food a little pricy and they have coke. that keeps me from going there more. I like dogs so find myself stopping by on my way out of Target.
4	fBAUnOZjmoBisEGCqVxpAQ	Happy birthday Mom! We decided to have a pancake breakfast together here. The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! Hahaha jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my "younger sister's" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.  AYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I thought! Crispy bacon, flavorful sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they really give you your money's worth in food and a little more. I'm sure if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, "There's a birthday in the house!" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)
2	rHUgriw9qQc8vUF1e9HA	The pizza is good but I've had better. There isn't a lot of parking in the direct area so you may have to park a bit off. Plus this place takes forever to make you food. We called for pick up. They said 30 minutes.  We waited 30 minutes and drove over as we are in the neighborhood behind them. Still had to wait another 15 minutes for our foid. Sheesh.
2	xsbtTYQFLD7NPQSXubN5A	Our waiter Mike was the best part of the experience at Bonefish; he was very attentive and a good guy.  Other than that, the food was a step above Red Lobster. I've had better food from the prepared food section at Whole Foods. And I know this is a seafood restaurant, but the grade of steak they use is Choice?! Really, like the value-pak stuff you get at the local value market? Neat!  Anyway,  you probably won't get food poisoning, but don't expect anything to wow you.
2	WPOWuMj96O2KWDaO85WA	Came here on vacation 2 weeks ago. Food is good (same as anywhere else), but this place lost major points for incorrect change and wrong charge!  1st my sister ordered a kids meal, the cashier charged it as a teryi bowl!  Yes, it makes a difference because she saves $0.75  and every penny counts, esp at the penny slots!  Then she gave me my change and it was wrong!  $0.25 cents off!!  Maybe she was having a bad day, I dont know, but when it comes to money and charges, she needs to concentrate and pay attention or else you'd get unhappy customers!
4	g7JUI9pCVwJndWfP4kZmBw	We are fans of this little local place - but we are not fans of buffets (just our own personal preference).   We order off the menu and usually take it to go and we have never been disappointed.  I get the Buddhist Delight vegetables that comes with rice, their pork fried rice (which has always been very good) and a large wonton soup.  The food is so hot that even when we get it home we still have to let it sit for a few minutes!  I love that.  NIce lady that takes our order and keeps things running. We eat here whenever we are back in Mesa.
2	sqv8C5n6EeRi3tTNlO1iA	New Management has taken over and the actual Maria is gone. Already things are going downhill, showed up twice at 8am and they weren't open. Hey then don't indicate your business is open at 8am, wasted my time and gas driving there. Burritos were okay.
4	QIcjSE003SrPvF8kZ12dw	Got the special combo that included a small smoothie and half a sandwich for 6.99.   And it was a lot more than I bargained for.   First off, the "small" smoothie was anything but. I got the Kiwi Quencher and could barely finish is. Delish though.   The half sandwich was really a hefty piece of bread with a generous amount of turkey, tomato and guacamole. I'd recommend the turkey, guacamole to anyone.   Good stuff!
4	fek4kWHixwoBDzEkujmANQ	I went to Zebra with a few foodie friends who are close to a couple of the chefs. We got to sample a variety of wines, appetizers, and desserts, and I have to admit I was impressed with almost everything they put in front of me. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the entree--it was a braised rabbit dish that was tough and overcooked (though the sauce was delectable). On a normal visit I might have sent it back (not something I do at mid-grade restaraunts, but when  you're paying the big bucks...), but given all of the free food and wine we had been consuming I felt I should let it slide.   The atmosphere was great, intimate yet charged with energy. I definitely plan on going back for a normal visit soon.
2	dc82VDmn8x7Ysy95S9eA	I get so frustrated when you get home and most of the order is incorrect or items are missing. What more do I need to say about that? The interior is surprisingly dirty/messy, especially considering the location.  The last time I dined at this location I said out loud that I can't believe the condition of this place and had I known I would make the choice to go elsewhere.
4	KuFWYXLkrJihsFTORQUOag	Family owned pizza shop that's a favorite for those in the south hills of Pittsburgh. The cheese blend is, in my opinion, what makes their pizza stand above the rest in the area. Great subs as well. Would definitely recommend ordering for pick up as delivery can be slow depending on the night.
2	KoBUDB8eFFb1nQBPOcSg	Man, this place was just so much cooler when I was in CEGEP ten years ago. Let's forget about the fact that it's overpriced, and that one has to wipe their hands and mouth on a roll of toilet paper. The "TEX MEX" has no seasoning or soul. That's it. That's all. the fajitas, the tacos, and the Haitian-inspired dish we are all tasted at our table. Everything was bland as my grandmother's beef boil. It was almost like "TEX MEX FOR THE ELDERLY" in a decor that the elderly would be uncomfortable in. The service wasn't bad though, seriously. In the end though, I'll drive down to Tijuana before I come here again.
4	hJ6QkMogPTmlDJJAIxN9kQ	Went here for my birthday and wasn't disapponted.  The place is small and quaint, but with old-school waiter service rarely seen anymore.  We started with the escargot for me and watercress soup for my hubs.  Both were phenominal.  I then had the seafood trio (lobster, scallop and shrimp) flambe tableside which was also very good and a generous portion.  Hubs got the veal marsala which was ok, and a small portion (good thing I had seafood to spare).  We finished with a strawberry tart for him and cheesecake for me, both were great and I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I finished all of this one!  Cons for us was that for a french restaurant the wine list was small and uninspired, the vegetable was preactically nonexistant, and the bread was pretty blah.  Yes, it is pricy, but good for a special occasion and something different.
4	COdAhRRywyqMEXWVXWEKA	Pretty good food, strong drinks, and a trendy and fun vibe. That sums up this great spot for hanging out on a summer evening. I am not a huge fan of the place on game days in the fall or winter because of its internal layout - I always feel like a bull in a China shop. However, the friendly and attentive staff usually sympathize with me and make sure my John Courage keeps coming.
4	Or00rixJRVLcNWLy6SzsYw	I'm not a big fan of Charlotte. For me it is a lonely, soulless city of finance, and as an effete intellectual from the 919 end of the state, I must be completely opposed.   But damn this is a good casual place. I was interning there a few summers ago and some Charlotte friends happened to be in town for a few days and they led me here. I had the Cincinnati chili all the way and it was tasty and kept me full the rest of the night. I was able to enjoy "Wedding Crashers" without worrying about an empty stomach.  Best of all, it was like $5. And there was a ton leftover. That made me wish I wasn't going to the movies afterward, as it would have made an excellent leftover meal the next day.
2	xTIur3T8wnivrO6yqunBA	I'd love to give this place more than two stars but their wine prices are almost laughable.  TRIPLE what some other places charge for the same wine.  Come on.    As far as the food, yeah, its ok.  Slightly below Mortons or any of the other big chains.  The seafood platter tasted frozen and watery.     Maybe the best steak in Madison but at these prices I expected more (and I really like expensive steak joints...this one just isn't worth it).
4	FDeSur29VGKnbYeo8HIpQ	Hmmm, Korean owned sushi joints that have sushi on one section and Korean food on the other.  You walk in and you see more people eating in the Korean food section.  Not so much on the sushi side.  Deductive reasoning kicks in and says maybe its a wiser choice to try Korean food.  Reason wins out and we go sit on the Korean food side.   The waitress asks if we want to order and we look at the dishes they have. The regular suspects are listed. Galbi , bulgogi, jiapjie, a spicy fish filets, grilled mackerel (ok so this is more japanese but we saw people eating it and it looked good), spicy chicken and of course panchan.   The panchan are good though may be not as many  as one would get in Koreatown Los Angeles but then again we're in Chandler.  The daikon kimchee is very good as is their cabbage ones.  Potato ones are my favorite as is the very well done spinach and sesame.   The barbecued dishes come out.  We had the option of us cooking them or the kitchen.  We rather let the kitchen do it since we didn't want our clothes smelling of the barbbq.  The spicy fish filets were excellent and coupled with the sticky round rice was a great contrast.   Everything esle was well done and most people mopped up the dishes.   Soba and cold noodle dishes were also available at the time I had dinner here at this place but I have not tried it.  A good place for good Korean food.
4	JXq5cvdJWixNc1LuSRP9gQ	I really like this place - I think it is more for why I have gone there then the actual place. My mother and I would have breakfast here a few times a month on our way to go visit my brother who was in the slammer.   The look/feel etc is great. The service is okay. Alot of the wait staff I have had there reminded me of overly stoned friends that I have - really nice, but a few screws were missing somewhere.  The food if I remember (haven't been there is over a year) is pretty good. I've only had breakfast there though. They have a bread basket that is awesome - but you need to share it with someone... it's a big basket of bread!   I hope to return the next time I'm in Phoenix.
4	9qj47nk7fUKIKbzPR01h3Q	Friendly staff, great service, pretty good sushi, and they have all you can eat!   My boyfriend and I have been going here for a while since it's near our house. Although it's not the same as Kai sushi and Brians Beach (my two fav sushi joints but located SW of Vegas), Yoko Hama Sushi is not that bad. They offer happy hour from 2pm to 4pm and 9pm to 12am. The all you can eat happy hour is $17.99 and $19.99 (not bad at all). For regular price all you can eat it is $25.95 for dinner and I think $23.95 for lunch.   The service is great because since we go here a lot the lady always knows what we want to drink which is iced green tea and she never leaves it empty. If you sit at the bar the chiefs are really nice, they always make sure everything is okay.   Must tries:  Screaming orgasm (by far my favorite, you will not be disappointed)  Tako (if you like octopus)  Yellowtail (delicious)  Surf Clam (Mmmm yummy)  Tuna kari (a kick for your mouth)  Baked Mussels (fantabulous) Tempura green tea ice cream (what a great way to end you delicious meal)
4	SCj7hJXRZQfsUq5Yn8yroA	I have been to this Winchell's on quite a few occasions since my initial review. I always end up here in the evening when most other donuts in the area are already closed.  The donuts have always been fresh and the service is always so friendly. The guys who work here are so nice, I really have to hand it to them.
2	eS0hIgz4AFBdk4XuenQT2g	1 1/2 stars rounded up to 2 only because their location is convenient.   The food is horrendous.    I want to like this place.  I really do.  But the food has actually taken a turn for the worse lately.  Its really bad.    The bar feels like a chain, which isnt necessarily bad.  Its clean and service is decent.  Its just the food...oh yeah, and their beer...  Their beer is pretty gross.  I'm still impressed they have two cask conditioned on tap but unfortunately neither is very good.  Overall their beers are way too sweet.  I leave feeling bloated and on a sugar high.  Syrupy if you will.    If you want to grab one or two and have a quick app then I understand.  I somehow end up there every once-in-a-while.  Unfortunately it keeps getting worse each time.    I'll probably still go here and there but I'm not happy about it.  Its one of those places...
4	tJDNDc26K4s0okFvbE5Tg	Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People.  From street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!
4	qZs3rRGfq7aCfVip1nWb0w	My parent's live in Chandler and La Stalla is one of the reasons we visit them as often as we do...don't get me wrong, I love my parents - but if I'm going to drive from N. Phoenix, there better be some good food involved!  We started going to La Stalla a couple of years ago because everything else was so crowded...we were a little concerned that there might be a reason La Stalla wasn't crowded - but then again we were starving and so we chanced it. Thank goodness we did! It is one of the better Italian places in the valley...now the problem is if it gets too popular we won't be able to get in!  While I have ordered off the menu, I generally get the special...I have had exceptional Salmon - crispy on the outside, slightly pink, moist  and tender on the inside...Also, one night the special was wild boar, so you know I had to try it - it was fantastic. Also, the pizzas are really good if you like more down to earth eating. All in all, a great place - we need more like it in the Valley.
4	Rdbh5Djh6nd5C0GDmxHQQ	Good chips and salsa, excellent service.  Friendly folks who greet you well and say good-bye when you leave.  MY staff love this place and I gave them gift cards for Xmas from here so they could go to lunch and talk about the boss!  Food is good but not great.  Not high-end Mexican but decent ingredients put together with care.  I highly recommend asking about their specials.  They are thinking about what they prepare and have some excellent dishes they have created themselves.  The spicy roast pork is very good - as an example.  Parking can be tough at peak hours.  I had to use the street last night and the place was absolutely packed.  Large lot but at peak hours...  Very good value.  You will leave knowing you have eaten something!  Decor is basic Mexican restaurant but comfortable.
2	UDEIINpQWi22AjOy8ZaaJw	I generally avoid Filiberto's unless I've run out of other options, and even then I stick to one or two things on the menu.  They can't mess up a basic breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes and cheese.  Well, I say that and the potatoes are always undercooked so they're crunchy from the rawness.  They make a decent AZ burrito, but it's greasy as all get out--you'll want to pour out the grease before consuming the last bit of the burrito.    Because it's so close to the house, I've been here at least 30 times, so I have a fully-formed opinion.  I used to be excited about them when they first opened--who wouldn't be excited about 24-hour Mexican right on your corner?  Over the years I've become turned-off by their cheap meats, overly greasy food, and inability to cook potatoes.    A better option for a cheap burrito in the area would be Los Favoritos in Chandler or Some Burros.
2	BUcwiCeNU8aqLLP2L31tw	Why on earth was I even AT the silverton buffet?  Well, cuz my dad wanted to get his $5 senior buffet on, that's why.  Otherwise I'm sure I wouldn't have gone in.  I've been to so many bad buffets at the locals hotels, I'm always leary.  But for a cheap buffet, the food was ok.  The prime rib was pretty good and they had some pretty tasty grilled veggies.  Oh and the German Chocolate cake was ok.   On the other hand, the mushy egg rolls and funky dried out cinnamon muffins were inedible.  And our service was horrible.  Our waitress was EXTREMELY slow... and I mean that both physically and mentally.  We asked for sodas for our group 4-5 separate times and she NEVER go them right.  Two diets, two rootbeers and two Sierra Mists.  Is that really THAT hard?  What's worse is it seemed like she couldn't have cared any less that she kept bringing us the wrong drinks.  She would just shrug and take the wrong ones over to another table.  Pretty lame.  Overall, I would add this to my list of places to eat only if you have some kind of seriously great coupon and you just want to get lots of food into your stomach for cheap.  If you're looking for great quality and good service.... keep looking.
2	mxHPIgDDNLYIJehxxJMyew	First of all, I have to preface this by explaining that I am a Philly girl - at least until I moved to Madison at age 25. One of my biggest regrets about living in the Midwest is the lack of real cheesesteaks. Although my personal preference is Jim's on South, as a kid I spent most of my money at Pat's.   So I was thrilled to read the reviews about this place, including the ones from other Philly transplants, and bundled up the kids and my guy on a Saturday to get a real, juicy, greasy, cheesy joyous mess of a sandwich.  All I can say is that I must have gone on an off day. A really, really, off day. First of all, we were the only people there the whole time (Saturday around 1:00PM), which might mean that they turn down the grill and therefore don't have it at a good temp for cooking. If so, it really is a mistake, as you will see below.   So we order, we sit, we wait just a few minutes, and then we are brought our steaks. I hate to say it but they were awful. Someone else suggested that the meat cuts vary widely, and I hope to god that's true. Because our meat was so tough that none of us could bite through some of our pieces of meat without a struggle. It was cut too thick, and secondly, it was so tough I actually wondered what cut of beef it was. It certainly wasn't the ribeye that Pat's uses. It was full of tendon and gristle.   The onions were barely cooked (as it not even translucent) which may be a result of the grill not being hot enough. There was none of that glorious juice that should have been oozing from the meat. And as the final straw, the cheese under the meat was not at all melted, and the rolls were cold. COLD.   It was a terrible experience. Even my 12 year old son wouldn't finish his.   I am praying that it was simply an off day, combined with the worst meat they have ever used, and an attempt to save energy by turning down the grill, that culminated in a terrible cheesesteak. I am willing to go back in the hope that it was a complete aberration. But sadly, my guy and kids are not willing to try again - it was that bad. I will have to go it alone. In the meantime, if I really need a guaranteed great steak, I will head to the Philly Way in Milwaukee.
4	2un9IDGuSbAZHyoqUAF7tw	Great food! People were always flowing in throughout the night so the restaurant stayed full. The menu included Salvadoran, Honduran and Mexican food. We stayed with the Salvadoran food which was excellent.   Pupusas with cheese. Delicious. Plate called: Super Tapatio including grilled chicken and beef, shrimp, fried yuca and plantains, rice, refried beans and salad. It was equally delicious. The plantain empanadas filled with "leche poleada" which is a sweet milk, rice flour mixture. It was different and delicious!  I'd go back any time!
2	gbIBN7C7MFJOAStPitnm7A	This used to be a really nice local bar and grill. They had GREAT crispy buffalo wings. The waitresses were very friendly and cute. I went here about 8 to 10 times during basketball season to watch the Suns, and fairly frequently during the playoffs. It was a fun place to hang out.  About a year or so ago, they had an ownership change and the effect was immediate and very noticeable. They no longer made the wings like they used to. The waitresses were all different, as if they had fired the entire old staff and hired new ones. I know waitresses come and go but the old Lager Field's always had a few familiar faces. Not anymore.  The new staff was also not as friendly and in general, the bar just didn't have the same vibe that it used to. The food in general was not as good, as a previous reviewer noted it seems like they canned the old cook in brought in someone who did things very differently and not as well. Probably worked cheaper too.  I have not been back since my one and only visit after the ownership change. I might give them another try next month when the NBA season starts again, but I am not optimistic. Looks like I may have to find a new place to hang out and watch the Suns raise my hopes and then dash them again in the post-season.
4	pCf4PyhWiqh2tMzyLXqA	If you need a mini vacation, the colorful and expansive references to Baja California are appreciated.  C.F.T. is a great spot for lunch, especially on a sunny day, no matter how cold it is outside.  Not much of a seafood person, I got the tacos and was able to get both steak and chicken at the waitress' recommendation.  The chicken is nicely spicy. The steak was a little under-salted but high quality beef and cooked tender.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  She even threw in a few "hey dudes" for good measure.  The house corn salsa is chunky and fun.  I wasn't wild about the tomatillo salsa because it had too many onions.  I went for the cactus salad as my side for the tacos and wasn't crazy about it either.  Next time I'll just get the black beans and rice which reprises the fresh corn and has no onions.  I didn't realize the tacos are served on a bed of cabbage so next time I'll ask for them to skip that part.  And I'm glad I asked for the cream based sauce on the side. But everything still had a lot of flavor even after a picky eater like me takes it apart.  Next time I'll order a margarita from their specialty drink menu since they offer my beloved Herradura amidst their impressive tequila selection!
2	UMaTlk7zemZRpuK3vUqyVQ	Ok, what's the deal with all the 5 star reviews?  A friend and I had heard about the great food at In-N-Out for years, so we came here with positive expectations. Got our burgers and fries, sat down, took one bite, then... "What do you think?" "Oh, I don't know, what do you think?" And so it went. Folks, these are good basic burgers, but far from great. The only explanation I can think of for all the ecstatic reviews is somehow they hypnotize you as you walk in the door, and for some reason we were immune. Or maybe they put something in the drinks. Meh squared.
2	LEf6qYd9yZ86DkTe3FY0w	I went in with high hopes...I love authentic mexican food! I saw some good yelp reviews, and live near by..... Not at all what I was hoping for...... I had the grilled chicken taco salad..... ugh....... quality was just not there! Worst Grilled chicken ever! My husband had the carne asada burrito.... he thought the same.... ugh.... quality was not there..... Their chips and salsa was the only reason for the two stars, fresh, tasty, really good. The rest of the food was not good at all. Ingredients are not fresh or prepared fresh. I get that they are family owned and operated...... but this is not quality authentic mexican food.
2	Ic7AUsiris1v6KcdwWYwA	I didn't love this place- even though i really wanted to!  My family and I were in Phoenix visiting from California looking for a good breakfast place.  The reviews had me looking forward to visiting the Good Egg.  On the plus side, the service was great, seating comfortable, and prices reasonable.  Unfortunately, we all thought (5 of us) the food was only acceptable and typical for a Phoenix suburb (sorry Phoenix, nothing personal!).  Frozen ingredients most likely (for example, not all fresh veggies in omelets.  Potatoes- didn't see fresh cut.  And, skimpy on the veggies in the omelet.  The eggs on my benedict were soft boiled, which really disappointed me.   For heavens sake, don't call yourself the good egg if you don't  know how to prepare one!!  Oh- and the coffee was weak.   Next time I am in the area I'll check out a different spot.
4	fUzgyVnahHaZ3NMy6rjfAQ	I've been here many times and love everything I try. The cod is breaded fried to a perfect golden brown. I really love the chew factor and the flavor is good. Mushrooms are fresh and hand picked to fry up to perfection. Never had better.
2	5FgCdj8VpPbjb9wvDWjTw	This place is just as good as the original one on Spring Mountain.  The good news for me is that it's right next to my office so I intend to sample everything off of their extensive menu instead of just the pho which I normally get.  Just in the last few weeks since it's opened I've tried some new stuff like the #2 veggie spring rolls which had some good tofu inside, #7 Banh Xeo which I really liked (its like putting a savory, greasy shrimp pancake inside a lettuce wrap and then adding fresh mint and dipping into sauce) and the #73 Bun Bo Hue which was a little underwhelming.    The manager, Eric, is really nice and helpful.  I will be going back again and again until I've tried it all!
4	9L7WHYwkAAZMEbRPNxRtYw	Our go-to carry out Chinese place. Great food and super friendly service! The proprietor's young (8-9 ish) daughter is always there and super friendly if you have kids. Our favorites are the shrimp lo mein, veggie fried rice, crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken.
2	VZtVQOLqygjSBJAIizPw	It has been about a month since we last visited this place.  I recommend going to the pub and not the restaraunt side.  Service was great.  We got a couple of pints and some wings.  Wings were overdone although the sauces were good.  Love the garlic parmesan wings, even though overdone.
4	IyzEYXpk3IPfqwsLdhF3g	Half bistro---half wine store?  It works well.  What else would one expect in Scottsdale?  Truly Southwestern-accented menu with an international flare. We started off with mussels in a kettle of Baja chowder.  It was amazing!  Our entre's were just as flavorful. We were told the dishes are seasonally tweaked which adds great variety to the menu.  This is one of those places that have a small menu and it shows with the exceptional quality of dishes.  They did it right.
2	U9O7llVAwsO3cWit4mgFg	This place is an institution, if you want smoked meat then I say drive another 2min to Abie's, but you can always count on Chenoy's on being open during the holidays, which is nice. I always end up here on New Year's Day because nothing else is opened. I've had their poutines, smoked meat, stir fried liver and it wasn't that impressive. But I don't think people come here for the food, it's been around since 1936, it's your old school, comfort food diner.
2	1tnZCptLtg0DkWXJR35DNw	I stopped by here when my boyfriend's friend was Djing upstairs.  The downstairs was about the best.  Dive bar, close quarters - I would've felt more at home.  I went up the first staircase and ended up in a crowd of people watching belly dancers.  Yippee.  Up the next staircase we went - and it was just someone's house converted into a Goth-house-party.  There was a plain old 1 person bathroom... a living room with artwork for sale, another living room with chairs and couches and a final room where 2 people can flail around to the dj who is shoved in a corner.  It has a great idea, but I think it'll be better once a no-smoking law goes in effect and it loses it's "house party" feel.  I also thought it was bogus that I had to fight through the crowd to go down 2 flights of stairs just to get another tiny drink.
4	v5ebOPbgTUcMEsLRlYBHsA	good place for takeout, not the greatest place to eat-in. we ordered tacos, rolled tacos/taquitos, and had the agua fresca. food was good for the price, you can eat for about 5 bucks. as a girl i wouldn't go there alone at night, but i'm a wimp.  there's a bunch of taquerias within a mile, and this is one of the better ones.
4	vNbSNV4TIWVDe93jYhtJg	My family and I went to Rawhides Doom Town last Friday night and it was so much fun. We did both haunted houses and the "Train of Terror". My 10 year old daugter was so scared before we even got into the 1st haunted house but then she had such a great time although she got a little scared at times. If you want a truly scary experience this is not for you. It is great Halloween fun for familys. My favorite part was the train ride. There were houses and buildings set up like a ghost town with dead people and eery lights. It was really fun.
4	R26jQ9xBU8tk9j3ysLI7g	I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.  Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.  Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.  I'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer).
4	1YlSr6sIoUayBBbCj2SDoA	Susie's is great--not the best but friendly, dingy and tasty. They try hard to be better than they are, but the proof is in the food. It's good--a little rough around the edges, but good. Strange front door...but I like it when I'm in Aridzona. Not as good as SoCal Mexican, but better than Serrano's by a mile...and Macayo's too. Now, Jordan's on Central...that's the place! But if you're over in Mesa/Tempe, Susie's is a good choice. Aloha....
2	EYBOwMvwfAfHuUckEdtg	I have been to this place 5-6 times, and thought the food good, the coffee great, and the servers, especially the brunette with the ornate cube necklace, very accomodating.   So why the 2 stars you may ask? Well, we ordered coffee to go last first Friday. The man behind the counter pulled our shots into a plastic cup. Now I am not a coffee snob, but this does change the flavor, and not in a nice way. Also, I know for a fact that my friends had complained to a mangaer about this exact issue before (they are coffee snobs), and was told they would make sure the servers did not make to go coffee like this anymore.    Also, about 3 weeks ago, we had a brunch party of 12. Most ordered breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which sounded really good with the fried potatoes. Our server brings our food out with no potatoes, instead heaps of salad greens with our eggs and bacon. She apologizes, saying that the kitchen had run out of them and she had chosen salad as a sub instead of fruit or other items.   As a server myself, I know you don't automatically make a sub. You come out and notify customers of the situation, and allow them to make their own choices.  Several people had ordered the items they did for the potatoes, and although everyone ate their meal, no one was happy. We did not want to make a fuss as there was a bunch of us, and the place was busy.  My Benedict itself was very disappointing. The bread rounds underneath were not toasted nor heated, so by the time it arrived to the table they were soggy and cold. The salad was a horrible match, as the dressing did not work well with the hollandaise sauce.   All in all a rather disappointing meal.
2	TCpddZDN2qbzyf5xDsC3Q	Everything was really except the meat !!!! Our meat was tough extremely salty. We had a hard time cutting it with our knives!!!! It was cooked medium-rare as asked, but still very tough. I've been to this restaurant twice before and was not disappointed. This time, I'm reconsidering going back......
4	Uu5YBYjGRbsAeshoSSg	This location of Chilis is pretty decent. It's located on the corner of Eastern and St Rose with plenty of parking.  We usually stop in during lunchtime.  The bar area is open seating with tvs mounted all around for entertainment.  That's where we find a spot.    We have had great service in the bar area.  All of the servers have been really friendly and frequently check on the table.  They have new mini tablets on each table for guests to reorder drinks, order food and even pay the tabs.  So convenient!   We've had several different items on their menu such as queso dip, fish tacos, fajitas and sliders.  Everything has been tasty and piled high.  I always leave full without room for dessert. They do offer several desserts but unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure yet.    It's a chain but I like their menu.  Give it a try!
2	r7nRiQKNyAKFAMYsrY0ADw	If you are a vegetarian, or like interesting food, avoid this place at all costs.  You may be tempted to meet someone for lunch--  business purposes.  dont do it.  find another place downtown.   Its not worth the loss of $10.  when I went...the service was  slow, the atmosphere was stiffingly stuffy, and my salad was basically iceberg and some fruit.
2	DIDjSBbpb0WbSgeY3xGjoQ	They need to train their waitresses on how to wait & serve on guests... This is the second time I've been here & both times I've had a different waitress but the same issues...I have to ask them for everything from the eating utensils,  sugar for my tea, for the to go box & for the check. After waiting & waiting I have to get up & go to the counter to ask for a to go box & my check  because they don't bother to come over & check on you or ask if you need anything. I spent at least 1/2 hr. more there then need be waiting to be offered a to go box, my chevk & to come pick up the check themselves but NO I have to do it myself (neither times had it been busy). Last time I reluctantly tipped & this time for the first time ever did I not tip someone...I will no longer tip someone for intentionally bad service...There was no reason for us to get the service we did (either times). PS...I'm a waitress myself.
4	UdtVdMzOKY8lbNIov0mRTQ	the lyonnaise potatoes are worth the trip alone. great breakfast spot, the wait in line can be long, and you'll have to wait a pretty decent amount of time for your food too, so i wouldn't advise coming completely starving. Phosphates are really good and not too sweet.
2	si0sW5RO87DEB6h5KWD8kA	Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.
4	IQm25efswknPgrODHdqwoQ	Early dinner before the Chaparral High School football game.  Got right in with no problems, well I guess so, it was 5:30.  Our server was very sweet, she asked if we wanted a sample of Pinot Noir. We didn't.  She gave me a good recommendation for wine and she was very personable and seemed to enjoy her job.  So nice to see happy employees!   My dad knew what he wanted, he orders it everytime, the chicken tequila fettichini with extra limes.  I usually do a pizza but splurged and went for the pesto cream penne.  I enjoyed it but I was confused with them calling it pesto. I didn't see much if any pesto. And the cream sauce was hardly there the penne was dry on the top. It looked like the sauce was not mixed in with the pasta.  Some of the penne tasted undercooked.  Overall, the dish was ok. Probably won't order it again.  Might just stick with the pizza next time.
2	CsA8EvlI3W7IwEBaZuv5dQ	There is nothing impressive about the food here.  The prices are kind of insane considering the food isn't very good. Even the rice,beans,and salsa sucked. I mean,how do you manage to mess THAT up?  We ordered oysters,menudo,camarones a la diabla, and some kind of fish filet. Taste-wise,It ranged from gross to eh.  The service,however,was good. We weren't ignored ever so I'm giving them the second star.  I'll probably never go back though.
4	APYzxQrRfIXoHd8fpveNxg	This is a good place, busy and noisy sometimes, but the food is top notch, free ice cream for dessert is a big plus for me.  Half California sandwich and tomato basil soup is a winner, as are many things on the menu.  Reputation is well deserved.  I go whenever I can, and I am not disappointed, ever. Staff stays on their toes and things just work well there.
2	hio3LJN6rexKEvOgI62g	I can't imagine anyone rating this 5 stars.  Three maybe but five? This is a chain burger joint - and the burgers are about 10 bucks.  The staff was attentive.  The food not terrible. And they have "endless" fries. If you need to watch the calories -- watch out here.  They put mayo or some other sauce on all the burgers.  Probably good for families with kids - if you have the $$$$.
4	6C6urEiMlhGiq4rk9SDDg	It's Taco Bell. Pretty good. Only issue I have with it is that unless you ask for extra beef and pay for it, you'll hardly get any beef on your food. Makes no sense. Other than that everything else is good
2	cMGqiK0wdcSkJfl8wTgnw	I would rather have my hand slammed in a van door than have to go back to this place again.  I have lived in Tempe for years and just never made it into The Tavern on Mill, but today I made a special effort to give this place a shot, but I should have just gone to Rula Bula instead.  I ducked into the Tavern in the late afternoon, only to encounter a total lack of hospitality.  Two waitresses greeted me at separate points in the first few minutes I was there, both with questions that might as well have been, "What are you doing here?"  Both times I was slightly taken aback, and I replied sheepishly that I was there for lunch, as I felt like I had done something wrong by even walking through the door.  The waitress who was my actual server seemed to distain me for some unknown reason, and I felt that I needed to work to win her over and demonstrate to her that I was a good customer.  Then I realized that since I was the customer, wasn't she supposed to try to win me over by making me feel somewhat comfortable in this establishment.  Anyway, the bad/indifferent attitude of the wait staff conflicts with the mellow surfer decor of the bar.  I ordered a burrito, enchilada style, only to be told that they still had to make the enchilada sauce, and that I could queso sauce instead.  Not that big of deal.  Considering that I went on a Monday, which is happy hour all day, I initially was planning on having a couple of cheap beers, but when I was near the end of eating, the check was put in front of me, signaling that my meal was over.  I would only go back to this place if a friend dragged me there.
4	hz6feLSH7Z0qjvPQOdxtxg	Crepes, just so good.  Fresh hot brewed coffee and free Wi-Fi aren't the only reasons I have to get my IHop fix. I go to IHop for their crepes.   IHop offers a great selection of sweet and savory crepes.   From the Sweedish, Nutella, to the strawberry with cream cheese Ihop will surley have a crepe to satisfy your cravings . If sweet crepes aren't your thing Ihop offers a variety of chicken and spinach crepe options, that are equally delicious.  If crepes aren't for you IHop's variety of omelettes and delicious pancakes will surely hit the spot.
4	JOOmpXpWq9h0n4zc0wO2PA	I got the club and it was amazing! Nice service... Love the bread and great Swiss cheese... The one thing I would critique is that they ran out of bell peppers and it seems from other reviews running out of things is quite common here.
2	MFhSiGPz3jhQQrM1lm1hQ	Immediate knockdown of a star for being a chain coffee shop that doesn't offer free wifi.  So there.  I stopped here to avoid a rainstorm that caught me without an umbrella and I thought it would be nice to grab a yoghurt, cappuccino, and get a bit of work done whilst I waited.  Mango yoghurt parfait was too sugary, cappuccino was more like a latte, and work was limited to offline stuff since I'm too cheap to pay the $4 for 30 minutes.  Especially since the rain stopped and I was out of there in 10 anyway.
4	KhattL95KQ7FYxMoyJaQsA	This is a great Brueggers location. It's got all the benefits of the other branches, including the delicious Everything bagel and the Leonardo da Veggie sandwich (which would get a great review for its awesome name even if it didn't offer Muenster Cheesy deliciousness). In addition to a great selection of bagels, soups, and sandwiches, however, this location doesn't seem to get nearly as crowded as some of the others. I appreciate being able to get a table and set up my stuff to work for several hours...so anybody else living out of a briefcase and a laptop, it's great freelance turf.
2	UfNQCARuuPQGvdAGVQWKg	I don't know why I bother anymore, honestly. Their bagels are good and all but they need some quality control on their specialty coffees. I asked 3 TIMES for a hot pumpkin spice latte and not only did I still end up with it on ice (I took it as is because they were busy and I was in a hurry), but it was also disgusting. Way too sugary for adult taste, in my opinion. They need actual trained baristas. They can't even make a proper macciato.
4	YmgNZN3PZk3ewOqUxQaRg	Garcia's was 'pizza' at the University of Illinois for decades.  Ask any alum and they'll have memories of the 'squares' that were served there, and many more used to steal the nice plastic tray they came in as it worked well at home for microwaving.  They had a bit tomato hot air balloon they use to fly around campus on football weekends and some branch stores in Big 10 campus towns like Purdue.  Sadly, Garcia's fell on hard times in the 90s.  They lost their flagship store right across from the Quad and folks had to hike a bit down Green Street to get their fix.  They then started skimping on ingredients, switching to a pre-made crust and other cost-saving measures as the company went through hard times.  Alums still go back as it tastes a bit like it used to but new students generally are unimpressed and look toward other options.  The crust is kind of unique--sometimes I wonder if it is fried and they had a good number of toppings that you could get on them.    Pizza by the slice is really a 'walk up' kind of business model so when they lost their high traffic location they really suffered financially.  You used to eat there just to people watch.  Still worth visiting for old time sake, and I hope they get back on their feet and get going again.
4	4ZZ1dxSbrxACnFKszS3aQ	I am a fan of diners.  Skyland is one of the many Greek-owned restaurants in town, but one of the very few (if any at all) that opens on Christmas Day.  It's a 24-hour spot mostly (I think it's closed Sunday late night through Monday morning).  I used to come here during the wee early morning hours after a night of partying like a rockstar.  Lately I've been here more for their dinner blue plates.    The food here is typical home-cooking.  Fried livers have enough to be shared (don't ewww me!).  Cabbage rolls are good, but it's only on Fridays (or is it Saturdays?).  I personally don't care for their mac & cheese (it's dry and not too flavorful). Cabbage & oven potatoes are my favorites.  Fried apple sticks as a side can be consumed as a dessert :)  The best part of eating dinner here is the complimentary cup of soup.  I'm a soup addict.  The weirdest thing here is their YELLOW gravy, I swear it glows!  I was a bit taken back by it, but I needed gravy for my turkey & dressing last night, so I hope I am not turning any yellow-er today (lol, Asian joke).  And to be fair, the ladies that work here aren't rude all the time.  In fact mostly they're very southern diner nice.  I give them 4-stars because it's a reliable & affordable place to eat.  They don't care if you sit there all night (and I have, studying).
4	dMYSSRYZgGOiS5sETnfA	The food was very good. The cole slaw was so delicious. SOOOOO delicious. Especially in the sandwich with the pastrami (I had a pastrami sandwich btw). But the fries in the sandwich were Eh. I wish they were seasoned better, but i think i would have enjoyed it better on the side. Overall, it was super tasty and the next time i'm in Pittsburgh, most definitely going here again.
4	dCGlYnXk1pMb97S8hNQinQ	I've been to Monterey Bay once for a business lunch and once for dinner with a large group.  Both times were very good--food was good, service excellent, and obviously the views are spectacular.  I read the comments about the outdated decor and agree, but I don't find that a major detraction, and really, it's all about the views, anyway.    The crowd on the Friday night I went for dinner included a lot of very well-dressed older men and very pretty younger women, people obviously on their first dates, to couple who looked like they had been married for 60 years.  It was pretty good people watching.      I wavered on 3 or 4 stars only because right now I don't go out of my way to visit there--which is what I typically have to do at minimum to give something 4 stars.  As I was sitting here writing, though, it occurred to me that I SHOULD be going there more often with out-of-town guests--it is probably the best thing I've seen up on Mt. Washington, though I haven't been to Isabella's yet (and know it always gets pretty good reviews, too).  And that is a great way to enjoy one of the most livable cities in the world!
2	LOzznyzgmD9EFsF3gG0Hdw	I want to like this place.  I love the salad offerings - they offer a good selection of salads that are always fresh, well-composed, and accompanied by a house-made dressing.  The soups are still bland and usually under-seasoned.  The daily specials are usually pretty good (sometimes under-seasoned) and a decent value.  There still isn't anywhere else in Oakland that you can get what Red Oak offers - and that's the sole reason that I've returned, albeit with far less frequency that I'd like to return.  The reason that I don't go there more often - the reason that I've always hated going to Red Oak Cafe - is the poor management that is reflected in consistently poor service.  Every single time I go there, the service falls short, I usually end up waiting far longer than I should (in the middle of the workday when I have other things to do), and it's irritating to me.  Really irritating.  For example, I went there last week to order a salad for takeout.  After ordering, I stood with three other customers and waited.  An employee (who looked to be a local college student) was carrying on a personal conversation with the cook - less than three feet in front of waiting customers.  After concluding his conversation, he started a new conversation with the cashier - asking whether a prior customer left a tip.  After learning that the customer didn't leave a tip, the worker carried on a multi-minute diatribe insulting the prior customer, and preening himself in front of the growing crowd (who were also waiting for food).  After this, he then had the audacity to ask us what we had ordered (all salads), and then proceeded to quickly throw together out salads - after we had all waited for him to finish his display of unprofessional behavior.  He should have been fired on the spot.  The man who appears to be the owner is frequently scrambling around filling orders and trying to do too much himself - while his lazy and undisciplined college student staff lounges around looking hapless and disinterested.  Every single visit involves one or more displays of thoughtless and unprofessional behavior: the cutlery tray is empty - because someone didn't do his/her job to see that it was filled with clean cutlery; food is left on the takeout countertop while its customer waits because of poor communication with customers; customers wait while workers stand around looking clueless; workers have inappropriate personal conversations in front of customers; food ordered to-go is plated for in-house consumption, etc.  It's a horribly run business.  That's why I'm done with the Red Oak Cafe.  It's too bad.  I makes me wish that someone with better management skills would open another cafe to directly compete with Red Oak in their food offerings .  They'd have me as a loyal regular customer.
2	tOGn7ftqt0oI98vthzJQw	Sticking with Vida.  1900 Cantina ambience is comfortable & attempts to be higher end Azteca.  Portions were huge, they couldn't figure out how to change the syrup for the soda.  Menu offerings are what you would expect for any Mexican joint.  Service was non existent & was overall disappointed esp when it is situated in the company of Carpe Diem & Custom Shop expected more from what could be a gem.
2	UQWNtjFqy8CptW2J1yyJaA	The first time we went it was amazing but we paid 55 dollars a plate for pasta, the next time was ok but very inconsistent we got the same dish and things were missing on my dish when we complained they were very rude. we decided to try it one more time and I got my dish and my lobster tail was completely raw inside so once again I had to complain they took the dish back to cook the lobster and once again were very rude I will never go back the serving size is large but if you want to split a meal they charge you a 20 dollar fee
2	mHLF9ViJ3EV84I1RDXLeXQ	I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked, and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up, can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance, but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night, since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.  I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want, on the side in a cup, with my burrito and there's no charge, but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.  Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for, but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.
2	2JBzmUDytzCLwn94xbVaQ	Tourist trap in every sense of the word. Restaurant and gift shop are overpriced and the ice cream isn't anything special. Come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs.  Visit Date: 11/20/09
4	ovoC6OUP63MGGPRhxClEw	Don't be fooled by the shady looking strip mall area that looks ripe for gang activity at night. This place is a gem. They definitely are in the low rent district on the Sahara side of the strip and is Korean (not Japanese) owned. They do a great job in providing good sushi (even though they are far from the ocean) and their preparation and presentation are very good. This rivals some of the best Japanese restaurants on the strip without the high price. We had the tatami room with a party of 11 and the service was friendly and attentive. They even gave us a ride back to our hotel in their own cars....what service.   Their teriyaki meats aren't very good, but their yakitori is excellent, don't know why that is. Top picks also include sushi, sashimi, udon, unagi, agedashi tofu, gyoza, chawanmushi, and chirashi. Somebody was trained well in Los Angeles (where the owners are from.) Give it a try, you won't be dissappointed.
2	42t141we5g4WTJqzLRFg	Lots of good reviews on here. I just didn't see it. The iced tea wasn't really that good, the rice was slightly overcooked and very sticky. The seafood pumpkin curry, I ordered it 4/5 hot and it was spicy enough I guess. The seafood was terrible. The shrimp weren't deveined and the mussels were bad: 2 of them were closed, 1 was decent, the other had a very distinct odor. The eggrolls and crab wontons were the best part of the meal. The eggrolls were perfectly rolled so they were probably frozen but they were good.
4	esT4SZOsJiJcRcMIhDrug	Love it! Small, about 15 tables inside but, outside there are about 6 more. If you go during the warmer months there is a band concert in the mall on Fri. and Sat. nights. (80's, 90's, eclectic) The sushi is good and fresh and does not dip into the wallet to heavy.
4	xZFLf03hjDirMBQpEa9mqg	I went here for dinner last week and I just wanted to update my review by saying YES YES YES!  I still love this place for steak and escargot, and always will.  They recently won Best in Las Vegas for this year, so congrats to them!  As usual, everything from appetizers to dessert were wonderful.    If you haven't tried this place, take the time to make a reservation and stop by.  It's more of a special occasion place because of the prices, but if you're in the mood for a great steak, being served and catered like the good ol' days with that old time atmosphere, please do stop by.
4	zhhpfjBMUFR8gkRiIvE7ag	I frequented this Sonic for years when I lived in Vegas.  Since moving away, Sonic is really the only thing about Vegas (aside from a few really good people) that I miss. No Sonic where I ive now, but the commercials taunt me.  The drinks are the best.  Go between 2-4 pm for happy hour.  Half price drinks. I hate to admit being addicted to their Super Sonic breakfast burritos, and even have a weakness for their foot-long coneys. Generally, hot dogs are not something I will eat- but Sonic somehow does those right.
2	ecPqg2ws3GC1n6UhdVEqyw	Typical sit-down burger joint. Not the greatest, i've had, nor worth the price. McDonalds beats them really well. Service is really crummy, waiters don't seem to care much about clients sitting down.
2	zlUHTgO9XHuNb7zdMRwCw	Went on Saturday, and man, how things have changed in a few months.  No longer have that wonderful asian sauce in bottles to have as much as you want.  You have to ask for it, and they give you cups with a little tiny bit in it.  Seriously, when you stick your fork in it, it coats just the tips of the fork, that's how little they put in it.  So I had to ask for two.  And it still wasn't enough.  They skimped on the macaroni salad too.  The meat wasn't as juicy either.  I can only imagine that maybe they have changed their management?  We will not ever go back, if we are in the mood for Hawaiian, we will stick with Aloha kitchen.    Ta ta, Ono...
4	p4y693KDbZ6GIg2hveDA7w	This is the 2nd set of new owners that I am aware of. And to me by far the best.  The egg rolls are the closest I have had to a NY egg roll, since moving here 18 years ago.  I also had the pepper steak which was very tasty. Good sauce on it and the crispy fried chicken wings were crispy I just wish they had a touch of salt and pepper.  All in all I was impressed and will head back. If for nothing else the egg rolls.
4	fX8ZN7ICSJYakJFDsx9ekw	Love this place. I've only gotten a pizza here a few times but I frequently get the Baconstix and Cinnastix. So good... Their bread is like crack. I've never had a bad order from here. The only downfalls: delivery minimum is $10 (my Stix are about $7... First world problems) and they aren't as cheap as their competitors.
4	ZwGs4GODFWzXAYiNPcZRw	We got there at 9:59 and they still let us come in and eat indoors even though they had already mopped the place.  Good food...it's Taco Bell, and the staff was cool. Had never had the dorito taco, so i got the $5 combo box with that, a burrito and another regular taco.  Was good.  I was expecting more from the dorito taco tastewise, but it didn't taste bad or anything.
2	X5QNlyJqgD15jSNBHBHRw	the price is cheap for vegas/general $10 for dinner. you'll be full. but this won't be the best food. some of it was great most were meh. i give it only 2 instead of 3 starts because the selection was kind of small
2	ycXWxarFENJMHYz0OHNg	I came here on a previous trip to Vegas and thought the food was ok. I decided to give it a second try, but was once again disappointed. The teriyaki chicken had little flavor and was very fatty, the orange chicken did not convince either. The only acceptable item was the chow mein.  The only reason this place deserves 2 stars is for its friendly personnel and the low prices.
4	HNgpNhQKfSxEuHbQYVlEJw	This is the first place in Charlotte (or most of the Western half of the state for that matter) that I can actually say has good BBQ.  Every other place the Q tasted like nothing or poorly ventalated natural gas fumes.  It's not the best Q  I've had (Browns - Kingstree, SC) but it's really good and better than anything else I've had in the area.  It's open for lunch only and no credit cards.
4	ENWONkT3IcCtrtjfxYPg	It's a great place to watch a game. It's a little gross (see the previous comments on the carpets and bathrooms), but it's a sports bar...so it kind of looks and smells like a sports bar. They've got great pool tables, lots of televisions, and the food is decent compared to some of the other sports bars around town.   The place has the feeling that it's got a lot of regulars...staff and guests seem pretty chummy. As I'm not a regular, I sometimes feel a little left out (Sob), but I do like that kind of environment, where everyone's friends.  So yes, it's dirty, but it's a safe spot to go for a decent night out, especially if the theme of the evening is pool or watching a game.
4	9ovBjUH31zDH6EOw6mqG0Q	After reading some of the less than stellar reviews I feel obligated to review one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Even if it isn't exactly an authentic representation of the traditional variety.   The staples here are excellent. The chips are fresh and a bit heartier than most. They are, indeed... delicious. The red salsa is of mild-to-medium heat and complements their companions well. The beans are also very tasty, not refried and smothered in cheese like some well-known offenders. The rice is tender and flavorful. Together with some fresh flour tortillas and you experience what is know as harmony.   The chicken mole enchiladas are easily my favorite dish here, with the mole being slightly sweet and mildly spiced. The hard tacos here can be a bit greasy, which I admittedly enjoy on occasion. The red enchilada sauce is pretty decent as well. I think I have also had the tamales here, but do not remember them standing out.  It's a pretty cool spot too with a patio and bar out back. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Sure, you can get better elsewhere in the valley, but Frank and Lupe's is always a solid choice.
2	2JTTCIWyvnx1O8lh6QUw	My aunt to me here, and while it seems like a good place, it left me unsatisfied.  The menu is more bistro style food, but the price is more expensive, I guess it's on St-Laurent so the rent must be crazy.  For appetizers, we had the fish tacos, and cold strawberry cucumber soup. the fish taco was nice, but there was only one, and on the menu it says TACOS!!! with an S which means more than one... It's an issue when your taco is 14$ after that, I just didn't care anymore. To me it's just lame to mislead people like that.  Needless to say, the food is average, the plating is very nice, and the price a bit gougy. My aunt treated me and the whole time I felt bad cuz it totally wasn't worth it. Nothing was bad, it was just blah, but a costly blah. so you gets ONE STARS...
2	XloLGabi0x2K0Yi7y7jQA	This place has a great look.  You feel like you are entering a very nice restaurant, but that is where the illusion ends.  I will admit that the food was good, generic, but good.  The hostesses seemed put out that we had come in and placed us at the worst possible table, right at the entrance, although there were plenty of empty tables.  It took almost 20 minutes for our waiter to show up and take our orders, and another 10 minutes to get us some water.    I had the Schezuan Beef, which was good and spicy, but I only had a single drink to last me the whole dinner since after our food came out he was MIA.  Even after our food was clearly done with plates stacked it took an additional 15 minutes for him to give us our bill.  I felt like there was no respect for my time and little care for what experience I had.  There are other places to waste your money.
4	EaWWnxe0XHbUbI66Hh94LQ	I have to admit I made fun of my boyfriend's addiction to this place for a long time, but I now understand it.  I have a rather sensitive stomach and a lot the other _____berto's style restaurants have an adverse effect on my digestive system.  While this is not a ______berto's by name, it is of the same style, but I have had no digestive repercussions.    Oh, and the food is actually good!  The burritos are hefty, the rolled tacos are greasy (but in a good way), the guacamole is tasty and even the fish tacos are yummy.    This place is cheap, tasty and on my way home from work.  A TRIFECTA!
2	W6roJpiFjyxonADCMXFpVA	They no longer have the Monahan Meatloaf. The new version is good, but not the same. The clam chowder recipe is also diferent, and not as good. The shepards pie is awful. It is just potatoes and a lot of ground beef. It has little flavor. I like a shepards pie with some root veggies showing, and some taste. If you just like a lot of ground beef and mashed potatoes, this is the dish for you. I would never order it again. I think the place has gone down hill. Too bad they had to ruin their menu. It is also over priced.
2	1q4qw1NCzgzPSdEAHxlMRw	Dirty bathrooms, paper towel dispenser doesn't work (wonder how many employees are washing their hands), and both ice dispensers are broke. Food was mediocre at best, looks like they stepped on my burger before bringing it out to me. Probably won't be coming back to this Carl's Jr.
2	IRpuqveQG159pn8vu0SEEg	Lousy Mexican. It's a downtown place designed to impress the Anglo crowd. Should be on the west island. You might as well go to taco bell and sneak in a corona. You'll ave the same culinary experience.
4	2ZBIhY405zvsqbZPQM9gsQ	I've been to a few Schlotzky's around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  It's clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great!  If you're one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day.  One quick tip - it's kind of tough to find, but it's a stone's throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though.
4	OXhSiMqx8kYHvoGrAJwcsQ	I have only had the Cheese Soup in a bread bowl here, but it is worthy of four stars.  My boyfriend has had the BLT and he said it was good, not that you can really mess up a BLT.  They have a large sandwich menu, soups, salads and sides.
2	gKRXYv5EYHhGaZO0cZDaA	When you work 3p - 7a and forget to pack your lunch, your options are limited when you want a midnight meal. My coworkers and wanted to try something new so we ordered from here. I got an Original Calzone which was just sauce and cheese - nothing fancy. The calzone was very bready, that wouldn't be such a problem if the dough actually had flavor and wasn't so dry. Once I cut into the thing, the dryness wasn't an issue because the sauce was so watered down the dough eventually became soggy. Lacking flavor and spice, it was definitely not worth $9. My friend ordered a salad and fries which looked pretty decent, she wasn't happy with the fries because she told them 'well done' and they weren't crisp enough but she did enjoy the salad. We may give this place another try, but I'll definitely order something else.
2	KIjAPd02JgaJxmCsZOOQ	We have been to Logan's many times but it had been a few months since our last visit. I tried to call to get a reservation, no only parties of 8 or more. So our party of 2 arrived at 6:30 and they place was only half full. Three employees standing at the hostess country talking, we had to interrupt them to ask for a table. We got a table and started reviewing the menu. WOW! prices have really gone up! The music was so loud we had to almost yell at each other. I ask twice the waiter about the music, he said its loud so you don't hear the kitchen. REALLY?  The other tables never filled in, service was good, food was not matching the prices. I predict, next time we try Logan's it won't be Logan's.
2	k0BCJ1grw2KIlFd4CsSGlA	I had already seen the reviews and known this place would not be the same quality as the usual CPK's.  But a 7  minute wait for the Works pizza is not bad.  The other options at the airport didn't look too appetizing to me in the limited amt of time I had.  Taste was more like the usual pizzas you could get at the usual lower quality pizza chains, so I didn't feel like it was worth the money I was shelling out for this versus other fast food places.  Pizza also looked a little overcooked.  But I two stars since it didn't taste bad, wait was fast, and people at the counter were nice.
2	Q9fTZ4DkKlXUtpyZMvB45g	The food was 3 out of 5 stars but the price was right. Lots of flat screens which was nice. Our food came out fast except we had to wait nearly 25 minutes for the cookie skillet desert. If that's usual then it would of been nice to have been told it would take that long. That's excessively long in my opinion and the reason why I won't be taking my family back. Also, it says it's kid friendly but there were no kids meals listed in the menu. The waitress apologized and read them aloud to us. It would of been nice to have it on the menu.
2	rvZglCSouxYf6h6JS2f24Q	Nu-art caf\u00e9 est connu pour ses d\u00e9jeuner et l'ambiance artistique. J'y suis all\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises et bien que la nourriture \u00e9tait correcte et m\u00eame un peu diff\u00e9rente, \u00e7a ne m'a pas n\u00e9cessairement impressionn\u00e9.

2	ZQYnwqq8dMtIefpD3V03Q	This little dandy caught my eye the other night, and of course, me thinking it was "French" I put on my big boy pants and expected to be WOWED.   I was not wowed.   Don't get me wrong. The restaurant was clean and pleasant to be in, and the service was good. The food however was..... so so. I ordered a salmon dish on recommendation from the owner (or the man as a perceived as the owner... he was a nice little Asian guy ^_^ ) It came with a salad that had a nice, sweet vinaigrette that tasted of ginger. But no bread.  None.    I need bread. I'm a chunky white man. Bread good. Where bread go?   to continue:  When I got my main course, I found that my salmon was a bit over cooked, and the sauce they had placed over the fish was ice cold. :( Now here's the thing; The sauce may need to be served cold and I'm a tard for saying otherwise.  Lemmie tell ya though, I don't do hot meat and cold sauce. I'm either all hot, or all cold - there is no in between. It's just how I roll. Anyway... The salmon was edible, but nothing to rave over, and the sauce was cold, but kinda tasty. The potatoes were delish.. I'm hard pressed to find a potato that I don't like, but these were fresh, "smashed" red skin potatoes and I enjoyed them very much. :)   All in all, it may be worth another shot, but I'd have to be convinced to go back. Or have Megan Fox INSIST I bring her here. yeah.. that would work.
2	KlGCaoSPf9UwwFmYGk02Q	Purchased a Groupon and thought it was a great deal. ( $40 worth of food for $20.) So my husband and I were craving Korean BBQ and headed out here on a week night.  We walked in and there were only 4 other people inside at the time. And they were non-Koreans which was surprising to see. The waitress was Korean and sat us down at a table. We decided to order my favorite meat (Chal Doel Begee) but she said they didn't get the delivery today so they were out. We then selected our 2nd choice which was Galbi and then she said they were out as well.   We were definitely disappointed and we should have just walked out but we were too hungry.  She said the pork belly is their specialty and they had it in stock so we went ahead with that. Typically pork belly is a cheaper meat at Korean restaurants so I usually try and avoid ordering it. But had no choice.   Growing up in LA, I've used to great side dishes at a Korean BBQ restaurant. They brought out 4-5. They also include green-onion mix(par-ree chae) as well as lettuce and garlic.  The total came out to $48 so we used our Groupon and in the end paid $28 including tip.   It seemed like there was only one waitress working and one bus boy at the time. Since it wasn't busy, we didn't wait that long for food but I could see it being a long wait if there were bigger crowds.  It looked like they had a full bar but didn't see a bartender.  I'm not sure this is the standard of Korean dining in Arizona but if it is, i'm going to have to drive home to LA for Korean food in the future.  The only bright spot is they offer Karaoke and have separate rooms for that. Not sure how much that costs.
2	d30Z7hSB2kgQo70io8dDBw	Went to enjoy a beer and some pub food.... great selection in beer but the food was terrible. Had, what I thought, traditional fish and chips. Terrible! Fries were over cooked and cold. Fish cold. Advised the waitress the issue .. she took the plate back and had it reheated. Stuffed the lemon wedge in the coleslaw so the lemon would not get hot!. Really pathetic. Did not replace the fries nor fish. Came back and really overdone now.  Will not go back again.
2	ScALvkE8wjq0kIQDPGk6A	Maybe I'm from L.A. and know what good chinese food should taste like...maybe good chinese food places I know don't wow you with decor and cleanliness...maybe I just like my chinese food cheap and greasy. We had a rather large group so we had around 7 dishes or so.  Walnut Prawns were pretty good, strange to have such a large prawn used in this dish but was cooked well, it was fresh, however, needed a bit more flavor.  The hot pot cod was the highlight, soft, flavorful and great texture.  The duck crepe appetizer was a very good start as well.  After that everything was either bland, cold, or just seriously something you could get at a regular chinese restaurant.  For these prices you should be WOW'd (at least taken on some culinary adventure, not just a two dish tour) by more than just fancy architeture...IN ADDITION, we ordered Hennessy Paradis shots and they tasted stale and not a $55 shot of cognac.
4	IV7M9jvRolyvyugCJb36w	My very good friends from Phoenix were nice enough to take me here when I visited earlier this year.  They had been coming here for years and had absolutely swore by its food superiority in comparison to any of of their San Diego and LA rivals.  I ordered the carne asada fries and received a huge pile of fries topped with guac, carne asada, sour cream, and cheese.  I added a healthy dose of hot sauce, and it was deliciousness on a plate.  I also had a nice giant iced horchata to wash it all down.  Sadly, I couldn't finish the giant plate and took the rest home.  The meal was awesome and memorable, and I can't wait t go back.
2	1ooo2wDtpfWPSb3YhJhmNA	Fairly standard Italian menu. Food was decent but overpriced for what you get. I know of dozens of Italian restaurants that have the same or better quality of food at half the price.  Wine list was nice too but very pricey. I didn't hate it, but it seemed like this strip mall restaurant is trying a little too hard to be upscale and comes off as a bit cheesy instead.
4	KHFboETwTSYRynxw1LL4Q	Everything was great, but the wait was too long, and the wait for the food was even longer. The cook on the steak was over, but I didn't want to send it back to have to wait all over again. The service was great once we were seated.
2	W17gtRMP2Bz00vhqxDU3A	China Grill is a very run of the mill 'Westernized' Chinese restaurant. It is similar in to Chine Toque which is located down the street, but I feel that China Grill has better food.   With all the great Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto area (which seem to be spreading westward) I think that there are many better options relatively near by. However, if you work in the neighbourhood and are pressed for time I would certainly recommend China Grill over Chine Toque.
4	kh3RSzxRU4G2Fsv5OEZ7w	Overall, this place was awesome! The service was prompt, the food was very tasty, and the menu was super extensive, with tons of stuff for just about any craving. My wife had the banana pancakes, and I had the Guadalajara skillet. Between the other people at our table (8 total) we had the french toast, the spinach omelet, and the normal American breakfast. All of the dishes were hot, fresh and good. We will definitely go back next time we are in town!  Bonus: all of the menu items are available 24hrs a day, I could definitely see myself coming back here at 2 in the am for some good grinds to help me forget about the money I lost gambling!
2	IOE48SEAixWcGhDcReUMQ	I have eaten at Brooklyn Pizza a couple of times, I've been when it was delicious and I have been when it was not.  Once we ordered stromboli and it was raw in the middle, so I had to finish it off in my oven at home. That is strange for a pizza place not to have that down to a science.  Tonight we went in and I knew it was going to be family central.  People, if you have kids it is a great place to have dinner.  Families are loaded in there and it is loud.  If you do not like kids, this is one mouse away from being Chuck E Cheese.  We had a couple of beers, salad, garlic knots and two slices, $16.  My slice was not hot, it was like they just handed it to me from sitting in the window.  I would go back if someone invited me, but I would never suggest it.
2	v8Mf5pX0O6iyKzj3zK8wA	I drove by because I happened to be hungry, and it was there. When I walked in , it reminded me a lot of Panda Express, except, I'd rather had eaten at Panda. The place was clean and quite, but I think I may have gone on a not so good day. I had the orange chicken, and it was a little chewy and rubbery as if it had been sitting under that lamp for too long. The egg roll had a weird taste, then again, when I went, I was pretty much given the scraps that were left. IF, I decide to go back, hopefully it will be better.
4	6pBSF4ug0GyKL7cBZr7w	If you like chicken salad you won't be disappointed with their chicken tarragon bagel sandwich! Their bagels are soft and chewy and they have a great selection of cream cheese! A little pricy for a bagel shop but worth it!
2	ZkywVNBCpVXvYUXFMPF8lQ	Went here for dinner during race weeks and I really wasn't impressed. I got a steak and my co-horts had chicken. Everyone's food was ok, but no one was really wowed and it was pretty pricey. Next time we'll try Tx Roadhouse across the street and hope thats better.
4	gVvDLKqbIVboBgrdSQBMQ	You might ask why four stars.. well cus I could say I've had better, as in taste. But AK will always be in my heart. Mostly cus Me and my friends come here A LOT! And this was the first islander spot I got to try when I first moved to Vegas.. Oh the memories.   If you always wanted to try something else besides the typical chicken katsu. I suggest trying the Lau-Lau plate. I'd say the prices are pretty reasonable for a quick fix of islander food.   The parking is plenty. And it's huge for having a family side and a party side. I'm talking about their restaurant and their karaoke bar. So, it's an all-around good chill spot for whatever you wanna do.
4	aVm4cJe3BJJ4mQUrnD0KYA	The 5 best things about Rialto Pizza.  1. The veggie pizza practically comes with a salad on top: fresh, crisp and plentiful.  2. A seriously delicious Italian hoagie. Darn near everyone does them, but Rialto is a cut above.  3. The Rialto Giant (28 inches, 49 slices) is too big to fit in my front door, but if you're having people over for a game or a party it's perfect. Tip: Use it as an incentive on moving day. You'll have more help (and more pizza) than you'll know what to do with.  4. An admirable selection of decently-priced beer means not having to make two stops on the way home.  5. If there's no game on t.v., guaranteed they are playing some basic cable reality show (which is the television equivalent of eating pizza).
4	kPtoooqdFdc7eg9466udBQ	I love Thai Basil!  It is hands down the best Thai restaurant that I have been to in Madison! My favorite dishes include the curry dishes especially the red curry.  I also love the chicken fried rice and the tom yum.  The service is pretty fast and they deliver which is awesome for Sunday night when cooking doesn't really feel like an option.  I have never had a bad meal there!
2	MTr7ULqectlbu5jcYDtmw	Food: Okay. I had the chicken pho with rice noodles. Thats probably all I would order here since everything is does not look that great. Soup is flavorful though.  Service: To be honest...horrible! The waiters are super slow. Theres always like one waiter for the whole place! Food took super long to come out and they messed up my order too.  Location: Next to the Coffee shop in Treasure Island  Atmosphere: Okay, I get the Carrows vibe again.  Price: Lunch is under $10, I believe dinner prices go way up.
2	lb2zowQKQcEDVO7C0NMIpg	Its really bad , i know that people who cant graduate high school have to work SOMEWHERE , but if they are working with handling money ... they should at least have a GED.....     My wife was not feeling well and left work early but she was nice enough to pick me up lunch on her way home even though she felt like sh*t..   Well here is the funny thing , not only did they screw up the order .. she asked for my chicken burrito with extra sauce no tom , they put no sauce extra tom ..  but they screwed up SIMPLE MATH on the change.     The bill was 13 dollars and 12 cents ...  my wife gave them 20 dollars and 12 cents ... they gave my wife back  5 dollars and 96 cents ... in which obviously is WRONG.  Then the cashier decided to ARGUE with my wife about the change ... really ?    We have spoken to the manager and our food is getting replaced , but you REALLY need to either make sure your staff is trained mathematically .. or teach them to use the built in change thing on the computer.    ugh.  *facepalm*
2	avS0VDqHB9SMdbsVIsT0A	Not a fan. I went into this coffee shop for a simple cup of coffee. I've had better coffee brewed at a convenience store.   I saw an advertisement for all you can eat waffles, that could be this establishments saving grace.
4	TsNPBD12ZzfwCcsag4A11Q	I may be a hypocrite slightly.  I talk about how much I hate sandwiches.  But I think the epidemic in boring sandwiches turned me off.  I've been meeting more and more unboring sammies lately, which has made me actually start to crave them!  I had wanted to stop into The Pretzel Shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels.  They actually have a whole case full of sandwiches and sides.  I opted for the turkey sandwich with horsey dressing on a pretzel bun (dah!).    That pretzel bun... AMAZING!  It was so moist and doughy, and not too salty (which I hate about regular ones).  I also loved the tangy dressing.  It honestly made me want to come back and buy up the whole store of pretzels, that bun was so good!  You could probably buy the whole store for $20 everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap!  I'll be back now for my new pretzel sandwich habit, and probably a developing pretzel habit.  All thanks to The Pretzel Shop!
4	nUw965qWHX5WckDfqVmH7w	I'm so glad that a friend of mine chose this for our "double date" night. I've driven past here several times, and never thought to try it. I wasn't crazy about the chips here, but LOVED the spicy pickled carrot slices that came atop them! My dish was fabulous. I ordered the Fajitas Cozumel, made with shrimp and tilapia, this dish is fresh and fabulous. Not to mention HUGE, I took home almost half! Next time, We'll definitely go back--hopefully on a day that it's not POURING rain(as it was when we went), because I'd love to sit outside! So nice.
4	YZPNqSmndrHFMhP1NjygA	This place was fantastic.  Ordered from work the other day and everything was delicious.  I have never seen the building (probably don't want to based on the neighborhood!) but the food was so good, I don't care.  Order take-out!  Yum!
4	KRHxOGMZLjH9ySvz3ynV1A	While in Las Vegas for my Dad's wedding, we choose to eat at Tony Romas for the rehearsal dinner. Good choice, I loved the baby back  ribs, the variety of sauces, I really liked the seasoned french fries and there homemade coleslaw . The waitstaff was outstanding, we had a great time!
4	x3rNubhkM4ucsJwXrBD4YQ	Great pizza smack in the middle of Squirrel Hill Pittsburgh.  I definitely liked their made to order pizzas which gave me a nice nostalgic reminder of NYC pizzerias while at school in Pittsburgh, and as such, the best pizza I had in Pittsburgh.  Not for the grease haters, but man, they can serve up a great pie.
2	gCjYlEhjPTsqqS1uK66cA	If all you care about is a hot pie then you have absolutely no taste. The service was par, but slow considering we ordered delivery from down the street. A cheese pizza is easier to make than teen pregnancy. The only thing that I like chewy is a four foot tall Chelsea Handler side kick. Ranch nor wine could save such a poor demonstration of corporate mismanagement. I highly recommend Pizza Romano in Oakland - ask for Lexi.
2	8i90xuIlYzyLCReXxbttsg	Drug use must be rampant in Tempe, or perhaps, there is a direct correlation between those who are high and those who review George's Famous Gyros on Yelp.    There is absolutely nothing good about this gyro except the quantity of meat.  There is essentially a pinch of lettuce, tomato and onion.  The sauce is there, but without much taste.  I've had better food at the ball game.    I think I will quit med school and just open up a gyro shop because apparently there is no competition since no one in Tempe knows how to make a gyro.  I guess all the Greek paraphernalia is analogous to an incompetent doctor with a great bedside manner, just because you look the part doesn't mean you are going to deliver in the end.
2	n3k0arGIkBBsgR3DfMggAA	The food at Chipotle is always great, but the service at this particular location is awful. The wait is only so long (even if there's no line) because the people behind the counter are slow to put your meal together, and they're always talking and joking to each other. Even when you're right in front of them ready to order!  I've been here many times because I love Chipotle and it was close to where I used to work. Terrible service won't make me go out of my way to this particular location again.
2	9FO5e1zOi5Gx1cDnSVRQMA	This McDonalds is very disorganized - like it's being run by monkeys. I go through the drive through regularly since it's on my way to work and they consistently get the order wrong or make me park and wait.
4	0WNNe5SioUVrFF4VzmOnxw	My wife and I walked in on a Thursday night... sat at the bar and ordered beers and food... asked to change the tv to the NFL network and they were more than happy to oblige! Had the machaca chimi and the wife, cheese enchilada and taco. All was delicious!! Bartender offered a free sample of their house margarita (as they make their own mix...)... unexpected, and delicious! We will be back for more!!
2	SNquWohPtKtbWTnFk6njw	Normally I enjoy ordering from here, however this particular evening, it took an hour and a half to deliver, my food was cold, and parts of it burned, and they forgot my salads, which is where they put the little dish of tzatziki in, so I had to eat dry, burned chicken.  On top of that, it took an hour for them to deliver the salads again.  After paying $35.00 for 2 meals, and a good tip to the idiot delivery guy, not impressed. And on top of all that, no one at the restaurant apologized, neither did the delivery guy. Really disappointing.
4	3ZTcpeDKiY3F9YUum2FXw	A very good steakhouse that makes sure you leave patting your belly in satisfaction.  The atmosphere here is very dim, and there really isn't a 'fascinating' view of the strip from here, but the service is impeccable.  I haven't experienced anything negative from any of the employees here.  The hostesses are attentive and cordial, the waiters prompt and knowledgeable, and the chefs....well they know what they're doing.  Like most steak houses this place offers a huge porterhouse (24 oz) along with your standard Rib eyes, and NY Strips.  Everything is cooked to the proper doneness that you ask for.  Dishes are served A la carte, so you do have to pay extra for that baked potato or fries to go with your meat.  Speaking of sides, Their garlic steak fries are a staple for me here.  yes I'm a potato lover, and these fries are actually more like logs.  They're a huge potato that's been quartered, then fried w/ garlic, seasoned, then served.  I recommend you use a fork and knife to chow it down, but nobody says you can't use your fingers too....it is a fry after all.  The appetizers are great too, I highly recommend the crab & artichoke dip.  It is on the creamy side, but the flavor is great!  The mac & cheese is exceptionally tasty too, fresh cheese, bits of ham, very creamy.  They do have a cigars available for sale too, and a pretty good wine list.  This place hasn't failed to disappoint yet, except when it ran out of their bagel chips (served as a general appetizer with salsa).
4	Lfh0UbbipxjREStvUPBgMQ	Although it is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, Los Olivos is definitely my first choice for Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale. The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.  What I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!  The meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it "right". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.  The prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this).
4	iUKzV5mGWkVXGyVggc7v4w	Don't blink because you might miss this little hole in the wall while driving by and also don't judge it by its look. I have been coming here for quite a while. The food is good and the prices are even better. If you're looking for fast cheap Chinese that is much better than Panda express this is the place to go. I highly recommend the vegetable lo mein and the orange chicken. Great spring rolls too! Overall a great little spot!
2	t7TevADMSymJE54OiQ	I used to really like it here, but now everytime I go I end up dissapointed. Its really not that good and so overpriced. I do love the decor and the family dinning they support it allows you to really spend time with the people you came with.
4	dfnVKBomFvCxF4x0y4tFZA	I just tried this place today (Fat Tuesday!) for lunch with my friend. I had Mardi Gras Combo which came with Jambalaya, red beans, rice, and shrimp dish (I forgot the name). Nice amount of spice, and I was satisfied with the "half portion which was only $4.95. I don't think the portion would be enough for a guy though.  Keep in mind that this is a "take-out" place, so there's no chairs or tables, but I didn't mind standing at the counter for a quick lunch )
2	sZFHt6DnaHqn75UljdGVRw	omg Becky, look at the white flour on that pizza... okay not only is this pizza NOT very good, but every time I order on line they mess up my order.  I am so done with you Papa John's.  When I moved I thought well this is the only pizza joint nearby that delivers but I have since found a few others to try.  I only went to you out of inertia. Do NOT, Do NOT try to trick me with the free pizza award for my latest complaint that you gave me extra sauce when I ordered light sauce.  Because i will THROW it away.  I hope I will be giving some other delivery pizza joint a good review soon.
4	M6JEyn1LvPd6fnIlwR7A	I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and "real" plastic plates! Lol.
4	YWkBLcipXZoSqLnL7uviQ	This Wendy's is great! The building is old but the staff is friendly and remembers their regulars. They are kind to the high school kids that hang out there in between school functions as well. It is good Wendy's food.
4	VDGwJQ3yilp6rEgAeXaXw	I am a huge fan of this donut shop.  I work nearby and stop in once a week for a coffee and a freshly baked donut because I simply can't help myself... The donuts are made every morning by the owner (who is a fellow Michigander!) and he is the type of small business owner who gives you the service and the product that makes you want to support him.  He even makes the Boston creme filling in his donuts from scratch!  If only the rest of his service staff was as genuinely kind and neighborly as he is when it's bright and early just after he's just finished baking his daily batch of product... But hey.  This shop also serves Thrifty brand ice cream.  Gotta love that for creative dessert endeavors, especially in the summer after a long shift if I can catch it before it closes at 5 on weekdays.   America doesn't have to live on Dunkin! Local family owned businesses ftw.
2	pLwGzoSawQob8A62EPcwzA	OK.  First I need to say that I'm not a Chinese food fan. But, I like some kinds of it.  Ambient of this restaurant is very bad. There is always a smell and smoke inside. Because of that you may start coughing. This is a very bad thing!  Food is OK. But I had better experiences about Chinese restaurants, so this is not my first option in C-U.  And, price is reasonable, actually cheap. However, service is so slow. So many people order by phone before they're coming to this restaurant.   To sum up, if you wanna have a Chinese food, Cravings wouldn't be your first option, as long as you're not specifically try the food of "South China". I recommend Evo, in C-U area.
4	EccoLkNtsxzdQh10KGag	This is a great place to dine for East African food. The service was very attentive and the food was great (we tried various items on the menu). I almost missed the entrance and went to the Middle Eastern restaurant next door. You have to go down some stairs to get to the restaurant (so don't think you are in the wrong place).   I will definitely come back to Buraka whenever I'm in the area. It's worth the trip if you are visiting Madison.
4	TdMOKi0wjAbqKhulWuYlNA	The atmosphere is great, the service is fast and friendly and the food is very good.  I got a chicken entree which came with garlic bread, a salad, a side of pasta with marinara and a vegetable.  They have a large selection on the menu for dinner and a bar/lunch menu featuring cold and hot sandwiches, calzones, and pizza.  I went on a Saturday at 6pm and there was no wait.
2	fGwtOkk0wEk4HYlPttF6g	I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did today.  Very disappointed.  It took a long time to take an order.  Both registers were going and there were about 5 people in front of me but was almost 10 mins to place my order.  Not sure what was going on.  The restaurant was very loud and it was too windy to eat outside so I decided to make my order to go.  I ordered a medieval burger (bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce) and fries to go.  Fries were ok.  Definitely fresh potatoes, which is nice to see, but they were quite limp.  I would have liked to see them double fried so they were more on the crisp side.  The burger was horrible and lacked flavor.  The meat was cooked medium but was very quite dry and bland.  Bacon was quite crispy, too much so for my liking, and the bun was gummy.  To be honest, it tasted like a poorly made Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. but cost twice as much.  Given all the 4 and 5 star reviews I'm willing to give this place another shot.  Maybe when it's less busy.
4	LR2Z1wxqGgukCvvc3Vjjg	yeah not bad.  very Haight/Ashbury-ish, every corner to this place has got something interesting to look at and observe.  a lot of colorful characters, if you don't mind that sort of crowd.  the guys behind the counter are very cool, the tea was excellent, but the coffee was so-so.
4	s4NqarEV1Cz1GF9ejbf2RQ	I was doing some work at GEF2 for a couple days and needed to get out of the office for lunch but didn't want to go too far.  My colleague suggested Sunprint, it is inside the US Bank building.  I liked it so much we went two days in a row!  The salad bar is really good and everything was fresh!  The soups were good- Veggie Chili everyday.  They also have a grill where they make-to-order sammies and wraps.  I got the Veggie wrap one day that was great and came with oven roasted potatoes as a side.    The place is very spacious- you don't feel like people are crawling up you when you are trying to eat.  I appreciate this fact.  Sure, it is not the most original place however I liked that it was fast and delish.
2	0r13h6Wf38rJMu6ZcM8LTA	Wow. I, uh...hmmm...  I would have thought since there was a decent line to get in that it would have been better.  I live in Vegas and I've seen some buffets in my time. I'd rather not see this one again. The enchiladas were gross with the processed cheese taste. The cheesy bread tasted like grease. Even the ice cream tasted like someone tossed in some Windex. How do you get that wrong? There was a hair in the chopped eggs in my salad.  I do have to say that the hot and sour soup was good as well as the chicken won tons.  If you don't need tasty, quality food, then this is for you. If you're fine with buying generic Kraft Mac & Cheese to save money, then feast upon these dishes.
2	E6cRECYxIqBMnQYgAosZA	This is the place designed specifically for the young, hip crowd. Something which I am not. It is where the stockbroker who makes $500,000 per year takes his $450/hr escort.  The place is gorgeous with a pink neon bar, open stairwell, and hot waitresses. The food I had was far too salty to be edible.
2	BJci9JuSPYXpvMhJDsFXkw	There's something about the word 'guts' and the general sloppy, greasy nature of the food that puts me off this place.   Nonetheless you should expect the usual builder's favourites of sausage and egg rolls with a generous dollop of brown sauce and other portable greasy spoon fare.  Cheap and cheerful, but not tempting enough to lure you all the way down to Leith.
2	WborPkaniIrcK8p0LrXlQ	Great atmosphere! Like a neighborhood pub; complete with regulars, big screen t.v., beer, and food.  I wasn't very impressed with the food and we had quite the variety. Big breakfast (bangers & eggs), cottage pie, curried chicken and chips, appetizers-chicken wings & gravy & chips. (chips the European style- American fries)  Had a coupon so, we tried it and I don't think we will put it on our list to go back. They had a heating problem so, they had the door open and it was cold. The prices were a little on the high side. They used to much salt in their food-to my taste.
4	cneR6mjo3iSc4dKFq4rQ9g	Whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make it a point to come here for a decent, no-rush, enjoyable breakfast.  The portions are decent, the service is friendly and consistent, and the coffee always tastes great.  It's away from The Strip and feels like a comfortable neighborhood place like I'm used to in SF, even though it is a small chain (of sorts).  My cousin loves his bacon cooked just right and crispy.  OPH delivers it right every time.  My taste is simple: scramble eggs, my meat choice of the day, toast, and the always there, good quality pancakes.  Again, OPH delivers consistently and I'm happy.  On occasion, I've had an omelete and it has arrived delicious as expected.  The place does get busy on weekend mornings, so a 20-30 minute wait is possible.    I'm never disappointed when I'm here.  OPH gets a good checkmark from me.
2	qpf17Jr7LQOhqvhEB3wGg	I ordered delivery, and it took over 2.5 hours to get to me because the woman could not find my apartment. After 1.5 hours, I was calling on the half hour to see what had happened. They told me the deliverywoman was "on her way," that she was "at my apartment complex" and then finally, at 2.5 hours, they told me she could not find my apartment number. If they would have let me know that much earlier, I could have given better directions; none of my other delivery folks seemed to have that kind of trouble and my complex isn't *that* big. I asked them why they didn't have her call me and have me help her find me, but they couldn't explain. Finally, as I was putting on my shoes and coat to get some food elsewhere, she showed up at the door.   They didn't charge me for the food, which was good, because it was cold anyway!  Once I reheated the food, it was really great. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Kung Pao Shrimp.   I will try them again sometime, but not delivery.
2	kaQUVBzEZJjvcoNEDFmg	Okay, so I was on my lunch break and wanted to pick up two sandwiches to take home for my boyfriend and me to eat.  The people were very sweet and the decor was cute..... I ordered one veggie and cheese sub and one club sub! but the taste was NOT THERE! It was DRENCHED in MAYO and by the time i got it back to my house which was very close, it was soggy form all the mayo.  Could not even eat it. blah....... I hate to judge things off just one time but would not go back again. left a bad tast in my mouth.
2	ICdgfvaw8XiyCBD1DdoFSw	I know it's Taco Bell and it's a revolving door for employees, over the 4 years I've been eating there, I'd rank the service overall a 2 out of 5.  And I know it's asking a lot to order anything special-order (like no sauce or extra lettuce), 5 times out of 10 they mess something up.  Worse than the average Taco Bell.   Oh, and the Mexican pizza shells are rancid almost every time. So often, in fact, that we never ever order them at the drive through since chances are they will be nasty and you don't want to find out 10 miles down the road.
4	wGdGPDD0FsPHVscGuvvBZw	Food is wonderful, nice size portions for a fair price.  Hot foods are served piping hot and salad was a little too chilled for my liking.  Dessert looked wonderful but too full it eat any.  Staff is super efficient and friendly.
4	u232iHXPaAP9dk005wHA	I am so happy I discovered this well kept secret! We feed our dogs a raw diet and he was looking for a place to get some inexpensive meet for them.  Well, he found a place for the dogs and us!  They have great prices and great food!  They also cater, so if that's what you're looking for it's highly recommended. The place has been open for over 60 years and the staff is very friendly!  They will talk and joke with you while you wait.  If you have never been to John Mull's Meats, you should definitely check it out!
2	uFBVTEcQs5cqcZp4fpVeqg	Such a great decor and vibe....that gets soiled by bad food. Had a steak that wasn't marinated evenly. Fries are served with Hellman's Mayonnaise...at this price is homemade mayonnaise too much to ask?  Service was ok considering we were a large group but they didn't bother to offer us coffee or dessert.  It's really too bad because this restaurant has everything to succeed but the menu needs a complete upgrade, and so does the food.
4	3K6Djy6in4TJ6ULQE8mSqg	Much cleaner than "other places" along route 74.  Some are cheaper but they are filthy with sauce spoons and food spilled everywhere. Not here.  I go here and pay a bit more for the cleanliness and excellent wait staff.   The food is good. Better than average. And where else can you even get hot pot.
2	jdr51F3Nyv9iG8PY6erVw	I am not from Chi-town and I have never heard to this place. But my friends who are from the south side were commenting on their delicious fried chicken. So, I decided to give it a try.   Their chickens are made to order, so it takes about 15 minutes for the food to be ready. If you are on a hurry, this is not a place to go. It tastes pretty good and not as greasy as I thought it would be. But I still don't get why they have a slice of sandwich bread under the chicken. I wish they have rustic rolls or corn bread instead. Since I didn't know what to do with it (I don't eat sandwich bread), I used it as a paper towel to soak up all the excess oil. It turned out to be very handy.
2	P8eGivTAuIAX40Z3B6xWqQ	I stopped in on Thursday night to give it a try, as the lack of BBQ in the Kierland/North Scottsdale area made this a potential spot in my regular listing of restaurants when I don't want to try something new.  As at any BBQ joint, the real test is the pulled pork and the brisket, so I got a combo plate with ranch beans and sweet potato fries as the sides.  The beans were nothing very significant one way or the other, and you get a huge order of the fries that needed seasoning.  The brisket did have a smoke ring, but no bark and i was not able to taste the smoke hardly at all: it was closer to pot roast than what I think of as good brisket.  The pulled pork was pretty good: it had been steeping in its own juices for quite some time, and they unfortunately serve it with the sauce already applied: you should ask for it on the side.  The real savior was the application of Tabasco: it seemed like the sauce had been designed with Tabasco included and then they deleted it from the recipe in fear of turning a potential customer away with too much flavor: with it included the pulled pork by itself goes to 3 and a half stars.  Whole place was fairly empty when I was there, but it was 8:30 on a Thursday...if you are really hankering for good Q, brave the location and go to Bobby Q's at I 17 and Dunlap
4	hKOubFkA2UcDCvxUlDe26w	Dinner was perfect with Medallion Filet's as the special with baked potato, broccoli and salad for $12.95.  Filet was perfectly grilled and I couldn't believe how tender it was.  YES....i will return when I'm hungry for a steak.
4	noW4kJrHdZs92zNk6UqsLw	La Cucina is a cute, small Italian restaurant in Squirrel Hill. From the outside, it looks a little rundown, but the inside is fine, though the tables are close together.   I called beforehand, and they don't take reservations on the weekend, but the man who answered the phone suggested coming before 7 or after 8:30 p.m.   The restaurant is a short drive from the University of Pittsburgh, and Squirrel Hill is a very interesting Jewish neighborhood with a great variety of restaurants and shops.   The food here was really good. It took awhile for me to decide what I wanted, because there are a lot of choices. No pizza though. I ended up getting a chicken/red sauce dish and my dining partner got regular pasta because he's vegan. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive. The soup of the day was ridiculously good -- it was some sort of pumpkin mix. Dinner for two was about $60.
4	kCnSujtXFCQ5hwWRt151iw	I love little family restaurants and this is a nice one on the main street in Lawrenceville. A couple years ago they expanded and opened another room which serves alcohol. That room has more of an upscale feel, but the other room still maintains that small-town diner vibe. I've only had a couple of meals here but I was satisfied each time.
4	JAJPZPBx4WbEbug7YMRVRQ	Best fried chicken in town...but, seriously, I can only eat it once every few months.  Let's just say...so much grease and fat, I can actually hear my heart clogging up.  But if you know you're going to need to take a double dose of your cholesterol medication, then it's nothing but good!!!  Also, this is probably the only place in Charlotte that I'd say you WANT to go during the rush of lunch.  There are some true characters both as patrons and employees...go, stand in line, check things out...but be ready to order when you're up!  They will not take any delays so just be prepared.
2	twsfvkCdB5ELsu2gHfvQyQ	I've never been to an On the Boarder before- but I was in the mood for Mexican and I was at the mall shopping with a friend -so we didn't want to go too far.   We started with a serving of guacamole - which was meh - it was basically mashed avocado.   Next I had the tres enchiladas - one of each kind (chicken, cheese, and beef). The tortillas were very rubbery and the dish was way too salty.   Not particularly cheap either for a run-of-the-mill lunch, I paid about $18 for my entree, 1/2 Guac, ...and a water.    I wouldn't return here on my own accord.
4	W0ETIotiBgPua1FeV3YYmA	Barro's is great.  If you're looking for some standard takeout pizza, this is the place.  Great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  And you might as well ignore that reviewer who gave this restaurant two stars because it's not better than something that is not the same thing at all.  Well, no pizza is good as caviar, so I guess all pizza places should be three stars or lower...
4	HGD2xeMGGnNArlxYgGXLg	I work nearby at a school, and we order from them for the students all of the time. They give us awesome deals, so we always go back. They're good to us.  Last night my daughter and I went there for an early dinner, and we ordered a pepperoni, black olive and jalapeno pie. It was ready in 10 minutes, and it was really tasty. They said it's chicago style, but it wasn't. It is thin, so it's like a NY-style that I like.   The drink list was limited (carbonated was about it), and I wanted an ice tea. The bathroom is back behind the kitchen and the place is small, but most people who work there are friendly.  You can't beat the price, and they do deliver.
2	JcOHxzBSKbm7EIhDAl8xA	People seem to think it's a unique Czech pub when Pivo is simply a chain.. The one in Stirling is much better (if it's still there) so for a chain, it should be cheaper. It's also badly laid out for space because it's in a cellar with low ceilings so if you are a hyperventilating hypochondriac like me, you might feel too enclosed. There's also more space in a wendy house than there is on the dance floor which isn't really a dance floor, just a space where perhaps a couple of tables would've fitted in instead.    Good for: Wealthy small people who like sweat.    Bad for: Tall people on a budget who get claustrophobia.
4	GOc4VMAfNZ2bM6dd6Yig	Delicious pizza. My relatives enjoy all the pasta and salads and such, but Im there for PIZZA so I guess its safe to say all their food is great! Very worth the price. Not that expensive but its definitely not Pizza Hut
4	7CvxuczeB1gejJwHQBFVVg	Sometimes you just want to go to a BAR!  This is not the place to be seen or anything - more of a place to kick back with some reebs!  Pool table, shuffle board, golden tee, and it has a seperate restaurant if you want to sit in a booth.    It is normal bar food, good hamburgers & they have the seasoned fries too (nice and crispy).  Service is usually pretty good.  Happy hour....drum roll please...........$1.50 draft beers & $5.00 pitchers!!!  What?  Watched an entire laker v celtics game and it was $20 between 3 peeps!!!
2	5F6QX5bEDJ3AxaVaQOPx9Q	On 2/2/10, My party of three came to Champion Gourmet for the hot-pot.  We found it disappointing.  The atmosphere sucked.  The place was cluttered and run-down, with a television blaring Chinese language soap operas at full volume for the entire meal.  We had to get our own water from a water cooler with dinky Styrofoam cups.  We experienced a severe language barrier with the wait staff, which in of itself is not a deal-breaker, but in conjunction with everything else, made the bitter icing on an already crappy cake.   Our hot pot took a long time to come to the table.  We ordered the spicy broth, with lamb as our main protein.  A plate of enoki mushrooms, squash, corn on the cob, cabbage, zucchini, tofu, and noodles was included with the lamb, gratis.  We also ordered some shrimp dumplings, clams, and squid balls.  The lamb was great - no complaints there.  The veggies were fine, too, and the squash was surprisingly delicious.    However, the shrimp dumplings were truly disgusting.  They tasted - and smelled - like low tide.  Oh my word, were they fishy and briny!  They stank up all our soup!  They tasted so amazingly bad, I couldn't determine if that was their intended flavor, or if they'd simply gone rancid.  And the clams were no better.  I couldn't believe how rank they were.  The squid balls kept me from losing all faith in this place's seafood.  They were chewy and mild, with a slightly sweet flavor.  Even though the wait staff was sitting in the same room as our party, they were too busy watching the TV to attend to us whatsoever.  I had to walk up to one of them and physically tap her on the shoulder to get her to take our second order (more lamb, and more noodles).  I was afraid that we might get food poisoning from the seafood, but my friends and I seemed fine all evening.    I've had better hot-pot at a Chinese buffet in Saint Louis, Missouri.  I won't be back.
4	IbbFwLaCk28TfpSUAXuGzg	While the long waits sometimes discourage me from going there, the food is absolutely amazing.  I haven't had anything there I didn't love.  Even better, there's a bluephies cookbook floating around town.  It should be worth picking up. Bluephies is so good, even a boring old turkey club is delicious, not that I'm dissing turkey clubs.  They're good, really.  Just sayin'.
4	lljzc5XXVF5TkIpHbqQAA	I've eaten here quite a bit over the years, but never written a review. I go through cravings, and when it's for chicken I really like their grilled chicken (they also got rotisserie style). I really like it's flavoring, I believe it's mediterainian type seasoning.  Also, recently, I started trying their grilled pork ribs, and I really like them and have been on a steady crave for those the last few times I've been there. They serve them dry with the sauce on the side. And I like this. If your dry rub is good, then you shouldn't have to smother your ribs in bbq sauce.  I've seen a bunch of bad reviews here on Yelp, and I will say they have their bad days (or orders). In my experience, every 6th order is fudged a bit. They need to clean this up and become more consistent. But the place is always crowded...I guess by people who don't post on Yelp!  But I want more places like this. Where else can you get freshly grilled or rotisserie chickens other than the supermarket? And the quality and taste is much better than the market - although almost double the price ($5 market, $9 at NCC).  I wish there was a place like this in Henderson, near my work, as it would be perfect for my lunch needs (fresh meat, no carbs - unless you splurge on sides).
4	nmRbFHrAPpqp2C8LOTkBMw	It is chain rating time for me folks... So here is another one for ya...    Panera has some goooooood pumpkin spice lattes, and brownies, and danishes, and coffee, and turkey cranberry sandwiches, and power breakfast sandwiches, and soup, and  and and and.......    That is all.
4	P1WBJNbgZbSFFId7J2mA	Pete's has been a favorite in my family since my dad was attending Tolleson Union High School. I'm not much of a sea food person, but it's hard to resist their shrimp and chips combos. Their Monster Burger stands up to any other fast food burger as well. Don't get me started on their sauce! You could put that stuff in an IV and inject me with it and I still wouldn't be satisfied!  But I never leave Pete's with out ordering at least one of their burritos. The perfect blend of beef, beans, and cheese! Weird right!? Burritos at a fish place!? Trust me... You won't be disappointed. Love this place!
2	6xKIymQMAktqxyZXhE4kqA	Finally Yelp has approved this page as I tried to review them last year. This is the closest Chinese place to me and I've been using them for a little over a year now. I am not fond of the general shopping area location which always smells like a mixture of cleaning chemicals and popcorn from Cinema du Parc. The wonton soup is alright but I prefer a beef broth to the chicken one which I think they use. Otherwise, the food is greasy and more than I'd like to pay. In the chicken with broccoli, you can literally see the oil in the sauce. Portions are also too big, share if you are going to order one of the main dishes, but this tends to be typical of Chinese places. You can dine there but you'll be sitting very close to the counter and if you come there at night, you will be sitting close to the hobos who come into the shopping area from outside. I have yet to find Chinese food (and pizza) that I like in Montreal and I suppose I will continue the search which has proved futile. Chinese food and pizza is one of the reasons I will be moving back to New York next year.
2	xFk8TODUdIAMx8ODWhQ	The pizza has too much cheese, is too greasy, and is not great. The gyro is average to good. The burgers were surprisingly good for a pizza delivery place. Better than a lot of delivery pizza in the area, but nothing special.
4	NEkqFWEHiqhsvLJayvmacg	This is a great dive.  It has indoor and outdoor seating, along with lots of beer and brats.  The place is on State Street, near the UW Madison campus and in the heart of Madsion.  It's been a favorite of mine for many years.
2	pRru5Cn2YYnY864tu7BnQ	The restaurant itself is very nice. Nice layout, very modern deco, clearly aiming at giving clients a Vegas feel. Here is the problem - besides the restaurant, nothing went right. Here is why: 1) We were 6 and seated on such a long table that I could not hear people sitting on the opposite side (we're not that old, all of us were in our late 20s/early 30s) 2) The waiter took our drink orders quickly, but didn't bring them for another 10 minutes. He then opted to wait another 15 before taking our food order 3) We had to ask for bread 4 times before it actually got to the table, and that's after we were served the appetizer. Likely a good thing since we need something to snack on between the appetizer and entree: we had to wait over 30 minutes! 4) The waiter spilled water all over the table and my friend (okay, that can happen anywhere) 5) One of the entrees went missing for a good 5 minutes after 5 of us were served. When it finally got to the table, the server dropped it so hard on the table that the recipient's bread plate shifted to the other side 6) We received our check (without asking for it, clearly) while we were still eating our entrees and still had dessert to eat!  I likely forgot a few others...My friends and I are usually fairly laidback, but I'm pretty sure I will never go back there for dinner, would rather spend my money elsewhere!
2	L0o4vmUZuUDIWgviQUHag	We came here for a bday party and on a consistent level, the service was terrible. I guess we had a server AND a food runner because after being completely ignored for 20 mins we finally flagged down (we later found out) the food runner. She said she wasn't our waitress but would take our order. When we asked her opinion about the food she told us, "the food here sucks". So we just picked a cheese crisp. After waiting 15 minutes for the beer we ordered, we flagged down the server who said, "oh, don't order from her, she's just the food runner" WTH? It took forever to get any kind of service and everyone walks around there like they are lost. The only time we go there is if someone is having a party which is too bad because the concept is good but the food and service always sucks. Stop hiring the girls for their looks and get someone in there with a brain.
4	hU7bvFJ00MUVQrgqyCfeLA	I am surprised there are not more reviews for Dillon's seeing how popular it is on the west-side.  It is a good BBQ restaurant, with a wide menu, friendly staff, and quick service (for the most part). Despite being overrun with white hairs, there is a good mix of families and often it gets really loud in their. The BBQ sauce is tasty and the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs are some of the best you will find over here. It is the type of place you can go to and know you will always have a quality meal- no surprises here. It has become a staple with my family and often a place we take out of town company. With locations in Surprise and 67th and the 101, it is convenient to most of the west-side.
4	Vil0bkeJaGS1vdnygy8wMQ	Great stuff!  Food is good, drive thru is very convenient and, like it's cousin Eastwind, the sushi is pretty good too.  Definitely a diamond in the rough.  The Bento Boxes are absolutely the way to go.  Plus they serve Pepsi, and I like that better.
4	De1m82chFBb6MNJVEgheg	I enjoyed our night at Suede.  My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($4 Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio.  I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area.  Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men.  As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston "fashionably challenged" girls and meathead boys.  The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college.  (Circa 2000-2001)  He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago!  Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected.   Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night.  All in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning.
2	eS6oxxChY3Mpi4WSnOwA8Q	Why do we keep going to Ketzal Mexican Grill?   Is it because of their location? Nope, just hop onto to the I17 and you can be at several restaurants in less then 10 mins.  Is it because of their prices? Nope  Is it because of their decor and ambiance? Big time NOPE  Is it because of their service? PA-LEAZE.... You can get better service at a taco bell!  I mean it too, just read through these Yelp reviews.  This place just doesn't get it. Your customers are telling you time and time again to treat us better.  Bar girl, please put down that cell phone and wait on your customers! Oh yeah, and stop waiting on us while your talking on that cell phone.  (it was almost comical!) Server dude, please be more attentive so I don't have to come looking for you to fill our drinks, chips or anything else. We need more interaction with you other than giving us our menus, taking our orders and then 1 hour later show back up to give us our bill.  Mr Manager/Owner, you seem like a nice guy every time we walk in but then you disappear behind the wall on your cell phone....   Is it because of their food?  May be.  My bride loves their Tacos Light ~ chicken in lettuce tacos. She orders this every time we go.  My son likes their burger and fries of course.  I do like their steak and chicken Fajitas and their chicken or carne asada enchiladas with their green or red chili sauces. Their salsa platter and chips are good and used to be complimentary but now they will cost ya!
4	19gakomcM56fmaN1UtB3A	I've been to two Waffle Houses.  Both had great service, and the food was fine.  Tons of it for cheap, which makes me question the quality.  But, in the end, it's a waffle with chocolate chips, so I won't be too concerned about health.  Easy parking, nice people working.
2	Ls9j5kw4jmO5kdId6eorwA	This place is so lucky that it's the only non-fast food place in this terminal of Sky Harbor Airport. If there was a better option, we would have gone to that in a heartbeat.   The place is seat yourself, which we did, but that meant that no one knew we were there until we had been sitting down for 10 minutes. We all ordered drinks and after the server brought them, we had to wave him down to order some food... he was very apathetic about his job which detracts from the experience.   Good place for a beer at the bar, perhaps. But as a restaurant ... me thinks not.
4	yeH8zfoNN1C4jJIBEOv37Q	I was very pleased about the haddock ( fried).  It was done just right.  The service was excellent.  There was a 40 minute wait on Friday night.  We arrived at 7pm.  The coffee was excellent.  I really like the down home atmosphere.
4	3OymAJEd6IpxHBdARERWsQ	I was having one of "those" days where you are running late and no matter how much you get done there is still more to do.  On top of all of that I forgot to pack a lunch.  A quick call at 11:45 a.m. for a order of chicken feta salad and a large drink really made my day better.  It got me out of the office and made me stop to eat.   The salad was delicious, lots of feta, chicken, a hard boiled egg half, a pepperonchini, and just right on the onion.  Also, you get a pita bread that is fresh and hot-great for sopping up the salad dressing.  Will be back to try something new for sure.
2	LKGEJqYAtAO0c5IL2uCWqQ	I stopped by because the lunch buffet is a good deal for just \u00a37.  The problem is that everyone else wants in too and this place isn't that big.  The queue can be enormous with no real place to wait.  Also I stood in line for at least 10 minutes before anyone even so much as looked in the direction of where I was standing.   Cramped and crowded, poor service, I can see the only reason to come here is to gorge your self on the buffet and vegetate in the streets while it digests.  If you're not planning on eating a lot or hate long queues, avoid this place like the plague.
4	ZuiHzbX9jxrlNROPdIJiA	Helpful staff when picking out a 6 pack of beer or a good bottle of wine. The place seems to almost always be busy and for good reason. It is always a good time for at least one of the following: caffeine or alcohol.
4	wF7n3EDFzwyZpT0KrXrBaA	If you really insist on having a stroke from the amount of fat in your diet, you can't do better than the Fry Bread House. Now you all need to know that I'm from California and we never had fry bread before we came to Arizona--but I discovered that I really like fry bread, like once a year or so.  The Fry Bread House has a decent menu of traditional Arizona Indian foods, including posole, mutton stew and yes, fry bread. It's also a gathering place for urban and 'rez' Indians alike...in a homey atmosphere.  Thank goodness they also have tortillas though! Because fry bread is just packed with lots of fat, salt and flour--not good if you're on a low-fat diet.  Now if they would just add acorn stew to the menu--I'd eat there every week regardless of the sucky parking.
2	S8ZD6DiIzhESTf7lSHQiwg	I think it's quite possible that McAlister's Deli may be the most overrated deli I have ever been to... ever.  Each time I go there (which isn't often), I leave feeling like I have somehow been ripped off.  I think their food is overpriced for the quality that you get and that's what irritates me about this place.  Maybe I just haven't been getting the right menu items but last weekend, I had a greek chicken wrap that was bland and full of nothing but lettuce.  The "feta cheese" in the wrap was either not truly feta or some really, really low quality stuff.  It had a mealy, gross texture and no saltiness to it at all.  Maybe it was goat cheese, but it didn't even taste like that either.  I dunno...I"m just not fan and I would much rather go to Panera, Sub Station, or Owen's.  Oh and everyone raves about their sweet tea, but c'mon now, this is North Carolina...you can get sweet tea on every corner.
4	fwBEcoN5RCJlAIqoQPLGg	A very pleasant surprise from a not-so-tried and true formula. I mean, naming a restaurant chain after a movie is not typically a path to success (was there a book or something else I don't know about?), but, in this case, it managed to work.   The food is very good, the ambiance is great, and the service is fantastic. I am not a true connoseuir of Greek food like I claim to be with Mexican food, but from what I can tell, the food here measures up nicely.   Big portions help make this a nice affordable lunch or dinner option around Old Town.
4	0alzOt9fo0NEkNOc3spVbA	it's been years since i went, but it was really, really cool. the setting is exactly what you'd expect from an authentic German rest., it was dark with lots of wood, very old world style. this was the first place i tried frog legs (isn't that a French thing?) but they have tons of great food.
2	eSH0uEwPMHCWgXNE8I2g	We order lunch from here regularly for over a year. It used to be great but the quality is really slipping over the last 6 months. Sometimes it is under cooked, sometimes the food is slimy. Overall it is very inconsistent. We keep ordering from here hoping it will be good again but it isn't... Also, they constantly say the food will be ready in 20 minutes and we have to wait there for an hour.
4	FQCRtVd94yMp14hUYd4MVQ	Chicken Wars 2009  KFC, Popeyes & El Pollo Loco have all been trying to get your fast food chicken $$.  Both KFC & Popeye's FREE Give aways have turned into complete fiascos BUT El Pollo Loco somehow manages to serve tons more customers daily without a hitch.  I walked into a packed restaurant with 5 cars in the drive-thru yet it only took me less than 10 minutes to order & get my food.  I got the 2 pc white meat w/2 sides & flour tortillas.SIdes were Cole Slaw & mac n cheese plus I oalso got spanish rice.  They have a salsa bar here so load up on pico,salsa & sauces.  The chicken is lime-marinated fire roasted so it is GOOD!!!! Very moist & juicy very tangy and so damn good.   I mean its NOT Koo Koo Roo which used to be in this very location BUT it is way and I mean way better than KFC or Popeye's.  The sides are real good too.
4	WlJxgZgRW8CgAi0BaiQ	We've stopped by here from time to time, usually for a bevvy.    My favorites of course are Diet Coke and Iced Tea.  LOVE their soft-crunchy ice.  This location is reliable.  They are usually fast, and always accurate.     My most recent visit was last night around 11pm, for the perpetually starving teen- just picked her up from a friend's house (and I KNOW they fed her dinner).  Don'tcha just hate those folks that eat around the clock, are stylishly thin, and can put down a large order of tots without blinking an eye?  Me too, usually, 'cept when it's my baby.  This late night visit included super fast n friendly service on rollerskates, combined w accuracy of order delivered.  Piping hot Tots, I had two, so I know.  Ketchup in the bag, along with 3 napkins.
2	7PXOeUV1O5Uv4vm8BclJeg	Just in case I'm wrong, this review is for the Nathan's in the Fashion Show mall.  Pros: The krinkle cut fries were lightly crispy and not oily.  Cons: The hot dog was very plain and ordinary.  The jalepeno pretzel was dry on the bottom and rubbery on top.  I hope this isn't representative of all Nathan's.
4	5VKXXzhMpX0MwSRUrOA	Stopped by because it was in close proximity to where we needed to be that afternoon. Noticed it had decent reviews. For a "hole in the wall" the place is good. I though the staff was very friendly and we felt welcome right away. Food was good, though it took awhile to get given that they were not that busy. But thats ok, the company was good so it didn't really bother us.
2	ODsVkXhjoEG4qSftmhcxg	My son and I stopped in here for lunch.  This establishment needs a lot of improvement.  The service is OK, not bad but nothing special. Just servers going through the motions. The food is mediocre at best. Myself and my family all being "in the industry" you come to expect a certain standard. The sauce is seriously lacking. It tastes like Prego or something bottled. Its not horrible but its lacking and forgettable. There are so many fine establishments in Vegas and this is another forgettable place. If you are reading reviews to find a place there are plenty of other places that are far better.
2	leooMKKLnJxqx5BIhTySlg	Didnt go into the restaurant section, but hung out in the lounge for a few hours with friends after eating sushi at The Ka in the same shopping center. It was smoky, and like a tiny casino. And everyone there looked like they went there to die, probably the oldest crowd I have seen in a bar in Vegas/Henderson. The bartender was very nice, and even cracked a few jokes with us. Best part....cheap drinks. :)
2	ll7yAqygBbcVVh38n0VNyA	I use to love to eat a Dennys, but my recent experience was not how I remembered it. The service is slow and the food is nothing special for its prices. The staff act like they are doing us a favor by bring us food we ordered. I will say stay away from here unless you like slow service and cheap food with good food prices.
4	K5gqqHqC6NjcCIpbY6JNqg	About 15 years ago, the owner would sell pocket sandwiches to people sitting in traffic along 2nd ave. I tried one of these and it was excellent: a good combination of fresh baked bread, meat, spices, etc. I've stopped by a few times since, but you never really know what will be served, or if the place is even open. This is truly a one man operation, and definitely an experience in dining. So yes, make your reservation, bring a bottle of Hungarian Bull's Blood wine, and enjoy authentic Hungarian cooking and a social experience.
2	3hTbcZIM8NU6D3ZgJLiELg	I went here for a couple after work drinks and a quick bite to eat with some friends. It was very meh. We were there around 6 on a Tuesday and the place was pretty dead. The happy hour drink specials were alright, but nothing spectacular. My friends only ordered beers so I can't comment on how strong they make their drinks.   I had a cheeseburger with waffle fries. The burger was decent. The bun was nice and the meat to cheese to bun ratio was good. The waffle fries were very disappointing. There seemed to be more batter than potato or something and they were overly crisp and dry. They were supposed to be seasoned as well, but I couldn't taste anything special.   The bartender was friendly, but when we moved to a table to eat, the waitress was a bit over attentive. I get that the place was slow, but you don't need to ask us every 2 minutes if we are ready to order and then reach across in front of people still eating to remove other people's plates.
4	nV5hNOrnO6yZhUbuVDKSjA	Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you "Hon"..."Sweetie"..."Darlin' "?   I know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:)   After my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:)   I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:)   Jim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:)   But, when they call me "cutie" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:)   What can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:)   That's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food.   So, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:)   About the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:)   Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me "good lookin":)   Even if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)
4	GtCCEWOTheI5XwlSSY6S8A	Totaly missed this place but thanks to yelp i tried it, the food was excellent, best part was it was cheap for the portion size and the tortillas and salsa (not chips not a typo they are huge) we some of the best ive ever had
2	UpqQIRxnN7GbRh9XmK6BXg	Won't be going back.  They have replaced all their vegetable dishes with many versions of bland seafood.  Started several things but had to leave them on my plate because they did not have any flavor.  Great service but bad food.
2	mrRDCaHrHjRCX9inBH9AhQ	Boy, I really wanted to like Las Cazuelas.  I was heartened by the nice and somber decor, much of it a holdover from Caf\u00e9 Porta Alba (including the wood-burning stove).  We started out on a good note; the chips were warm and the salsa was very nice; both were plentiful.  Our tamal appetizer was also spicy and good, and the queso fundido was delicious, too, with a healthy portion of mushrooms and chorizo within the mixture.  Our margitas, (two house, one special with agave and higher-end tequila) were also tasty, although no match for the knock-you-out variety served at Pasqual's.  Things started to take a downturn, however, quickly thereafter.  We first learned that the restaurant was out of guacamole.  This also meant that every single dish that came with avocado, a favorite of ours, would be coming without it.  We were encouraged by the interesting menu selections, but were feeling weighed down by our appetizers, and so went with soup and salad selections.  The fajita and Yucat\u00e1n salads, promising baby greens, came with a bed of uninspired bagged romaine.  The remaining veggies (remember, no avocado) in the Yucat\u00e1n, including jicama chunks, were frozen.  Yes, frozen solid.  As one of my companions mentioned, "What was I thinking ordering a salad at a Mexican restaurant."  Fair enough, but the more adventurous menu suggested that things might have been better and that it would be okay to risk.  My own tortilla soup was also bland and without any real flavor.  It was akin to a Progresso chicken soup.    We skipped dessert, but the bill for three of us came to $70.  The food did not live up to this tab, nor did it match up with the decor.  Our server was nice and attentive, but I will be unlikely to return to Las Cazuelas.  This means we're still on the hunt for a really good Mexican place in Madison beyond the taqueria experience.
2	tsoI21OnZdKv0XVJ6YadtQ	I go here because it is convenient and I leave here thinking I should have went somewhere else. My walnut shrimp tasted like they had been "re-cooked" and fell apart. My beef tasted like it had been sitting in the pan for a very very long time. The cream cheese wontons were very old and dry.  The only highlight was the kung pao chicken. Lots of chicken and squash. It was delicious. I wish I would have gotten more of it instead of the above.   I always get the 1/2 1/2 with the fried rice and chow mein. It was ok.  Service was fast. But, I don't want to return here and will resist the urge for a long time.
2	RTtqT5LJVAX1EIPkPoCPQ	The pizza here is normally ok to good but a great value so we tried the Gyro sandwich and that was a mistake.  They put 4 very thin slices of meat. Everything on the sandwich over played the minuscule amount of meat. Very disappointing now i can't trust anything on their menu to be a normal serving size. So long you lost us
4	Fwxc7SzJ9yA7IxHYfVrIdQ	I return finally after the big clean up... it's still cheap and great. Mind you, the place looks old and the deco is minimal.  I always go for the special pho to determine the authenticity. The beef broth is ordinary this time and it has lost some flavor (not saltiness). The spring roll is fresh and delicious... but the sauce is ordinary. Who needs it anyway?  Diners, enjoy the Vietnamese cuisine without going broke. If you want ambiance or gourmet Americanized foods, best to skip it.
2	A1FrBWAJqFiUkDzMXICf3w	Not sure why, but I've been here a couple times for their steak & lobster special.  It's $7.11, and you get what you pay for.  It is steak, and it is lobster, but probably the worst of the bunch.  Their other diner food is decent, but nothing special.  I only end up here when I'm lazy, since it's like a mile from my house.  If you're lazy, go there as well.  If not, go anywhere else.
2	ngWg9DvhJkouMw4cbvMQ	disappointment....I was actually driving down McDowell Road looking for a Honduran place that I had heard good things about, saw this place, and decided to give it a go.  I wish I had kept driving.  I am a big fan of tortas, however, and could not resist temptation.  I ordered the torta de aguacate, which is basically an avacado sandwich with mayo/crema.  There are jalapenos and a tomato on it as well. No lettuce.  The bulk of the taste is the mayo/crema, which was so overpowering that I could not finish my meal.  I ordered to go, so I tried to mask the taste at home, adding various ingredients in attempt to improve the flavor by killing the crema.  Morningstar chicken and delicious New Mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately.    The place was clean and the bread would have been good without the mayo.  I suspect that the meat tortas are better than the vegetarian one, so others may have a better experience than I.  The elote sounded interesting, roasted corn on the cob with cheese, lime, and chili.  It had the mayo on it too though.  I will not be going back to try it.
4	O9ur5I9G86d9xu1zVK9uZw	I barely remember what I ate, but the atmosphere and the service was awesome!  It was a while back and I don't even know if htey still do this but they have salsa and dance lessons going on WHILE you eat, with the diners.  It was truly awesome and so much fun.   Of course, it's on a volunteer basis, it's not like your soup gets dropped off at your table and you are forced to salsa dance with you server while the soup gets cold.  I should head back and see what it is like these days.  I am surprised there are not more reviews.  It's by AZ 88.  PEPIN is fun and the food was decent and the service was great!
4	HPbHhaTyCCWEY6HBWyGeRg	A great deli with good food and service.  Park Central  is a great traditional deli with a large varied menu. Today we had the sloppy Joe and it was very good, as were the side dishes and desserts.  Our Sloppy Joe sandwiches were big, very big, and very flavourful  and Park Central  doesn't skimp on the meat. Even the children's  menu is a bargain. It's rare to find a deli where the food is good and still be able to satisfy my nephews craving for a grilled cheese sandwich.   Deli staff comes around to see if you need a refill, napkins, or just to ask if you need your table cleared of dishes.  It is comon to see staff carrying food to tables for elderly patrons or mothers with small children.  What more can I say, good food, good  service.  A warm, friendly atmosphere where one feels like a valued customer.
4	fvSWtInUCnwazxOWuJYCig	I like my share of microbeers, but this place has the market cornered! Is it the Tempe water, I hope not. But, the food and brews are the best. Kiltlifter and heffie are two of my personal favs. Others have remarked how good the Peach Ale is as well as the IPA. For a great place to enjoy the microbrews, off the beaten path atmosphere and overall..cozy approach, stop in for a pitcher on me ;)  If I am there, I will surely buy!
2	jbh3xRO9n1guvQtwTnGdvw	Eh. Nothing special. I was hungover and waiting for my flight so was excited to see a burger joint, but was overall disappointed.  I got a Ruby Cheeseburger with cheddar cheese, fries, and a small drink. It came out to $15 which is ridiculous even for an airport.  The burger itself was average tasting as were the fries. It was extremely greasy, however, to the point where I took my first bite and a gallon of grease hit my shorts (which are now ruined).  Everyone who didn't order the burger (which were two people) had to wait 15 minutes for their order. It was a chicken sandwich and a turkey sandwich so can't see why this would take that much longer.  Also, soda refills were $0.79. If you require people to get their own soda from the soda fountain you should make the refills free.   Not your worst option, but you're better off going to Chili's Too which is a one minute walk down.
2	qvwmGp9S8yeUJVll6iYeFA	I took my wife here for dinner so she could experiance what I had.  There food was great but it seemed as if they were a little short staffed as we waited several minutes before anyone came an took our order.  After we place our order the appatizers came out in a timely manner and tasted great, they also made a special burger for my wife, but the time it took to get served was way longer that it should have been.   We hope things get better or all the remodeling they are doing will only benifit they next tenant
4	Y5HE9Dp3GvuMrYsx632Dqw	Good food, small hole-in-the wall place but food is authentic and yummy! I had the chicken tacos and the chicken was tender and not greasy. I have also had their menudo which was somewhat plain but I they give you things to put in it. I think they make it that way since people like their medudo different ways. Their pork burritos are great, i always get mine wet as i love the combination of the flavor of the meat and sauce. All together a good restaurant, I love this place :)
2	ZaJchjA20nVZiYd38GzV6A	First of all, I really wanted to like this place.  I've read such positive reviews and I was really looking forward to a great pastrami sandwich.    I ordered an original pastrami on a french roll with potato salad and a soft drink.  The total bill was $12.88, so I would say a little on the expensive side.  The french roll and the pastrami were both very dry.  I had to keep adding mustard to moisten it up a little.  After every few bites, I had to keep taking a drink just to put moisture back in my mouth.  I've heard they make their own rye bread, so maybe that is better?  The potato salad looked good, but the seasoning they use is heavy on dill.  I don't like dill at all, and so that is all I could taste.  If you don't mind dill, you might like their potato salad.  By the end of my meal, I had most of the potato salad and the two ends of the dry french roll left on the table.  I ended up eating the rest of the meat plain.    Maybe I just caught them on a "bad" day?  But judging that I was there around Noon (the lunch hour), and there were only three other people eating,  shows that this is not a local favorite.
2	l0zS5tJdC33p9cbIxF5WQ	I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. The new decor is really nice and fresh but it ends there. The food was not very good. No presentation and no taste. The only thing I liked was the wedding soup. I visited with 5 other people and they all said the food was not very good. Good things were the decor, no wait, fast service but that's it. I think they need an overhaul on the menu and some more spices to help the bland food.
4	DICvK63eXlRqlRu3jPg	Great place, always stop in when I am in town.  They have a wood oven and cook most everything in it.   I love the Italian beef on skewers with vegetables that they do in the oven.  Pizza,  and deserts are great.  Salads are very good and a meal in themselves.  One desert, and I have never had it, is huge and obscene, but looks great (it is also done in the wood oven).  Excellent Italian wine list.  I don't know the deal with the prior owners but the Italian guy I meet who I believe owns the place now is very nice.  Big soccer fan.  Waite staff is very friendly.
4	xZLGFlB2FGhpB1kcpdOaA	to be honest, i think this is one of the best places to get pizza in the valley. the sauce they use is very low acidity so that the pizza actually tastes better. i am not sure what the person who said Tessio's sucks thinks is good pizza...this is worlds better than any other pizza delivery place (way better than pizza hut, domino's, etc...).  definitely worth the delivery wait.
2	qluA9RiZ7xBZMePPsgwRA	WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE????  I've been coming here 1-2 a month for 5 years, and it has progressively gotten worse. They don't have half the things on their menu, so if you are looking for something other than the VERY BASIC combination plates, you're better off going to another location. Some of the items they don't have anymore are: pork katsu, pork cutlet, lemon chicken, POTATO SALAD (Aloha A Go Go?!), grilled salmon, KIMCHI, aloha fried rice, manapua, egg roll, any sort of curry, etc.  They also have/HAD a stamp card where 20 stamps would qualify you for a free meal. I went there last week to get my final stamp (which would have made this meal free), and the girl tells me that they are not doing the stamps or honoring the cards anymore because of new management. She tells me the change happened in December. WOW.
2	yYkSLiO6Nxtx4H2Xj2LRg	Didn't love it, and I expected a better burger for the price I paid.  Pros: - presentation was superb. It looked very palatable (until I bit into it) - hearty portions  Cons: - very heavily seasoned and salted - the patty itself was not very moist, just felt like grease was manually slathered on top of it - the price made me expect something a little better - my fries were inconsistent... some were very salty and some were not seasoned. I even had a few soggy fries that tasted uncooked to me. :(
2	XOMt0fTGgLIUWqnTWnlRA	Go for the fried pita and bean soup, as those were very good, but my meal tasted like it was reheated twice before serving.  The service was  unattentive  and slow. Not the place it was in the 1980s and '90s.
2	lOgKVNpGxO65S19fLeg5aA	Paradise Bakery you are not.  I'm sorry, you're just not a paradise to me.  And I hold bakeries near and dear, believe me.  You are a common bakery - I'm not sure how many states you are in but you are common.  Maybe that's your problem.  Your locations are fine.  Nice enough.  You have free wifi.  Good.  But your muffins?  They just don't do it for me.  They fall short of similar establishments offerings in the valley and in other areas.  Go to Wildflower Bread and get yourself a Morning Glory muffin.  This is what young muffins dream of becoming when they grow up.    And your cookies.  They are so prefab tasting.  My wife had an oatmeal raisin cookie and offered me a bite.  She broke off a good size piece and I tried it.  It was doughy.  And there were no raisins.  And I had to look to find a flake of oatmeal.  But they were sugary in that prefab, gritty, not very good sort of way.  An oatmeal raisin cookie should taste like...oatmeal.  And raisins.  And perhaps a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, not gritty sugariness and doughiness.  Blech.
4	QvJKyHnLVCRqYkSgwjDg	I'm lucky enough to have a flexible work schedule which allows me to pick up my kids from school periodically. Our typical next stop? The Soda Shoppe and a seat at the bar (always). Ice cream for them and a hot dog, hamburger or BLT+pimento cheese for me. Fast, friendly service that won't break the bank.
2	wHlkwL89aUh18w0rBnggA	If I was coming just for the adobo fried rice omelette - think of a burrito (chunks of adobo meat in adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette), I would give this place 4 stars. But you would soon forget the adobo fried rice omelette after suffering from the service. My four friends didn't get their food after waiting for an hour and one of them just got spam and eggs. Seriously? an hour for spam and eggs? what!?   I would come back here only if I called it in for pick up. Yes , only for pick up unless you want to faint from hunger. The other dishes were just ordinary but the adobo fried rice was the best version of adobo i have ever had.
2	P7qfgZSld3jJQuQdtGhBg	The Nile Cafe is very, very small.   Very.   I mean, really, the place is teeny-tiny...but it doesn't matter much. It's also usually empty.   When I first started working downtown, I didn't know where anything was. I had no idea where to head for lunch, with the exception of the Jack in the Box across the street from my building...and that was just not going to do. Driving around on 7th St., one of the first beacons of possible culinary delight winked at me from the corner of Roosevelt - The Nile Cafe. I love Mediterranean cuisine, so I made time to stop.   I've actually visited the Nile Cafe several times, and the experiences are always so different from one another. The food is consistently okay, with two marked exceptions - the delicious artichoke hummus, and the absolutely terrible falafel.   The service is where the big gap resides. There is one man who works there, (I perceive him as being the owner, although I have no actual reason to think this), who is very kind and courteous. He is patient, attentive, and soft-spoken but also friendly. Everyone else who works there is disinterested to the point of rudeness. Blank stares, no verbal acknowledgement...it is very uncomfortable to dine in, and, honestly, a little uncomfortable to order out.   I go back occasionally to fulfill my desire for artichoke hummus. Other places make this, but none are as full of chunky goodness as their variety. Some of their soups are tasty, and almost everything else on the menu is typical Mediterranean fare - not bad, not great, and capable of hitting the spot if you're in the right mood. The falafel is baked, not fried - being moderately health conscious, I thought I would enjoy this change in preparation. I didn't. Falafel just needs to crunch, man!  If you're going to try the Nile Cafe, order out. It is so rarely busy -  you can be in and out in less than 15 minutes, unless you neglect to fill up your meter's belly and your car gets towed.
4	tem6wysSG44VaHzv572vw	Pretty good food and usually a good time. Staff always seems nice and knows what they are doing, always seems busy also...they have cheap drinks and usually specials. I recommend the wings or the provolone(fried).!
2	wKl8HFFGqURVCYi7G2fyg	If Yelp  had 1/2 stars this would be a one and a half.  I reserve 1 stars for places that I truly dislike.  This restaurant I just kind of felt sorry for.  Nothing that the "slick" old family feeling that their menu invokes came through.  Maybe after all this is just a good pizza restaurant.  I had spaghetti with sea food sauce, a small salad, and club soda. No bread was forth coming.  This came to $19.50.  The only thing good about the pasta was that it was cooked  well not over or under but al dente.  The sauce which had a few sprigs of spinach , a few shrimp , a number of unidentified little balls of something that did not look like any sea food that I was familiar with and one, count 'em up folks, one piece of squid.  The marinara  sauce was bland. watery, and boring as hell.  They need to move up one shelf at the Harris Teeter.  I was shown to a table in the back room where the constant chatter of the wait staff centered on mostly last nights date, last weeks party etc. Noisy!.  I was never asked whether my food was satisfactory how I felt about world peace, or any thing for that matter.  This place in my estimation has little idea of the basics of restaurant hospitality.  When I finished my main course I was handed my check. No questions i.e. How was is it? would you care for dessert? How about some coffee? Don't get me wrong. No one was rude. A pleasant woman up by the door thanked me for coming and hoped I would be back.  I will think very seriously about that -- but at this point it doesn't look likely.
4	wdOioUbtgiVlrwSWc1jw5Q	I ended up going here today because Spinato's is closed on Sundays & Mondays (god damn you Spinato's, why are you so tasty).  Overall I was impressed with the place.    The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and cozy, with a very large, wood-burning brick pizza oven viewable from most of the tables.  We walked in right as they were opening so the oven was still firing up, but it was entertaining to watch.  The menu is fairly eclectic, a selection of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes compliment the array of pizzas available.  The pizza selection ranges from your typical pepperoni to mozzarella, basil, and cherry tomatoes, with others containing very traditional Italian toppings.  They also seemed to have a pretty decent wine selection, even though that really isn't my cup of tea.    The pizzas are thin crust and don't utilize any tomato sauce (at least none that I saw), but were very good even though I'm not a big fan of thin-crust pizzas.  Everything tasted very fresh, which is nice when you're burnt out on Papa Johns.  My only complaint were that the pizzas are a little small (12'' and they only come in one size).  For $17 I was hoping to get a little more for my money, but it wouldn't stop me from coming back.    Definitely more 'date night' than family-dining.  I didn't see any tables for more than four people and there isn't a lot of room to push tables together.  All in all worth checking out, but I still think I'll head to Spinato's when I want a regular pizza.  One thing to watch out for:  The place is small and tucked into the corner of the strip mall.  So much so that the parking-lot-visible sign is located over an establishment that is now closed.  At first I thought the restaurant had gone out of business, but further investigation proved it was simply hidden.
4	32n2G3mUgA5Gz2cGA8Hmiw	Jalapeno cornbread....yummmmmy.   Known for rotiserrie chicken and it is quite good and so is the rest of the menu.  I could get full on the cornbread and be fat and happy and ready to go.  There usually tends to be a wait on the weekends and last time we learned that no hats were allowed in the dining room.  A little stiff for a rotiserrie restaurant but it is still delish.
4	uGlqYs2x4UX7tDeKuo5iDg	This is the nicest, most courteous, most efficient Taco Bell I have ever encountered. The food even tastes better, as if the fryer is adjusted a little more precisely and the line made a tad more effort to put things together just right.  If I give it five stars, unwary readers will expect that the menu has somehow changed to be authentic, and of course, Taco Bell food does not aspire to authenticity in any way. Taco Bell aspires to ranch dip with taquitos, The difference is that when it's done badly, it's depressing; and when it's done well, it has a certain cheerful vulgarity that's easy on the wallet.
4	VSI9wXn8fTddulEeCri8Q	this is a consistently good mexican restaurant, but definitely not my favorite. my husband loves it so being the good wife that i am i give in once in awhile and let him have his yummy. i think the prices are a bit steep for standard mexican fare - especially when i consider top shelf compared to my new obsession, el encanto dos. the portions aren't too small or too outrageously large. i'm not a huge fan of either fundido option - the $11ish one or the $14-is one ... althought the $14 one has higher quality beef or chicken. there are far better fundidos in the valley. his tacos with a side of rice are always good, and he eats every bite. i recently enjoyed sour cream enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken) and they, along with the rice and beans were a solid dish. service is always good but our most recent experience (monday night) featured top notch service. our server was attentive without being annoying, funny without being fake, efficient without making us feel rushed. we loved him! this 3 star restaurant gets an additional star for service.
4	Gohb5fDHpn3T7MwmkQ2oQw	I heard this was the place to go for some good empanadas, there empanadas were faboulously delicious i happened to get there right when they were finished making them and grabbed a couple beef, dip them in the chimmi churri sauce and OMG they r to die for. I can not wait to go back here and try some of their other items on the menu.
4	gXjN7G0bOqXbJLRpMiIXQ	As a new Arizona transplant from Manhattan, my wife and I have only been in this area for 8 weeks, I think I know a thing or two about pizza.  While not quite Manhattan quality, Gus's is certainly close.  We placed our order online and it was delivered within minutes of when it said it would be.  While the pizza was a tad on the cool side, the pie had the look and feel of real NYC pizza.  If I have one complaint it's that the crust was a bit bland. For $8.99 for a large, with 4 toppings, you can't ask for much more though.  Gus's may be a different story at 3:00am on a Saturday when 10,000 ASU kids are ordering pizza, but I highly recommend it for a quick and easy weeknight dinner!
2	8UV5eGcnzPvJTYM9b4cMaw	Where to begin.... I had some pizza bites or something like that. They're like Totinos Pizza Bites, but when you bite these, bright orange grease spews out the back side and burns your hand. Avoid them! I found the restaurant side uncomfortable; there aren't any booths where you can see the TVs from. With the noise level and the inexperienced waitresses, a TV view is necessary.  Places like this would never make it outside of Phoenix, but there are so few options in Laveen, this is one of the only sports bars in that area worth going to.  One saving grace; the beer selection at the bar is fair. The draft prices are okay. The wings aren't as flavorful as I had hoped - or as hot as they scare you into believing - but they are cooked good and have good texture. There are a lot of TVs but it seems like they're hard to see wherever you sit. The crowd is good, and they have trivia game machines and weekly poker tourneys. All in all, it's decent.
4	fqsG6Yp9maePqeBtRoGtZA	I've been here a twice with coworkers when working late.  We come during happy hour and take advantage of their half off appetizers.   This time we got the Nachos, Hotiyaki Chicken Tenders and Fries and the Egg rolls.  The Nachos seemed smaller than the last time but it was still tasty with: Jalape\u00f1os, Sour Cream, Beef, Cheese and Red / White corn chips.  There may have been more to it but that's what I remember.    The Hotiyaki Chicken Tenders was served with four pieces of chicken, covered in their Hotiyaki sauce.  It was a mix of Hot Sauce and Teriyak and it wasn't at all hot.  Came with a few sticks of celery, carrots and ranch sauce.  The Egg Rolls come with a dipping sauce and 4 egg rolls cut in half.  I wish I would've taken pictures of the food but we were already tearing into the food.  The service was great, we got refills on our drinks before asking and the waitress checked in at least 5 times us during our visit.  The Lodge has two areas when you enter: A Dining room and the bar area.  Having been in both, it seems like a nice cozy hang out place with TV's where ever you look.  I like the atmosphere and the place is clean and welcoming.  If you're ever in the area, I recommend give the Lodge a try, you won't be disappointed.
2	FihpOWIzsUc9yD1PkvUsxw	I work in the building that is connected to Cafe Siena.  There are literally hundreds of people who walk right past this place to other places to eat.    Today I found out why.  After looking though yelp for a new lunch place I found Cafe Siena and was reminded how close it was.  The menu looked good.  I went downstairs and went in.  Noone greeted me, so I walked up to the bar.  No bartendar,  but a couple people sitting at the bar having lunch.  I sat for a little less than 10 minutes browsing on my phone.  No greeting from anyone, it appeared that the staff was actively avoiding eye contact with me as they flitted about.  Finally I gave up when I saw another patron irritatingly having to flag a waiter down to get his check. Noone tried to engage me on the way out the door.    So I went down the street to Cosmos, which is awesome.  They greeted me, took my order and had me taken care of quickly.  I suggest you do the same.
4	P6bwk8zrbnXckSaO4OgA	Went to a few places around a few surrounding neighborhoods and came across this  place out of the blue.  Wow... from pizzas to subs, or hoagies as Pittsburghers say, it is allllll good.   Not too much or too sweet of red sauce of this pizza and the crust is always tasty.
2	YI5lX8fGTEPXHtKqGXcy0Q	Ended up here at 10pm because everything else was closed. An underwhelming Italian with undercooked calzone and soggy spaghetti. On the positive side, it was only \u00a330 for two people including some of their house wine. Overall, I won't be back if I can avoid it.
2	FT9FSl4WH4wb8XMj9Mtbrw	First time there, last time I will come back.  I really just came in for a rootbeer which they no longer have on tap, which makes me very sad.  But i was in the mood for fish.  I ordered one of there combos and the service here was awesome, thats the only reason why they got another star from me.  The staff is great.   Anyway the fish was way too salty, everything was dipped in oil, and truthfully after I ate the food I regret my decision.  It didnt sit right, and i felt disgusted.  Everything was room temp and after walking out the door, i knew I was not coming back.
4	8aG4DQARAq5cU1yoRUHJ5A	We had never been here before but tried it.  We're now loyal customers!  From what I understand, the restaurant was taken over by new owners in February 2010; I don't know what the menu and atmosphere were like before (from some of the reviews back in 2006 I'm going to say not great), but it's FIRST-RATE now!  It's not stuffy or pretentious at all; the waiter was friendly and outgoing, as was the executive chef, who served us our bread and checked in a couple times throughout the meal.  First, a very pretty, relaxing atmosphere, including a piano tucked in the corner (live music starts up again September 15th).  I had the "Fruits de Mur Aux Gratin" and it was fabulous!  Very rich and delicious.  My fiance had the lamb shank and it was equally as good. We also shared the fried calamari as an appetizer, and were not disappointed.  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, which is beyond me because I think this place was exceptional, and very fairly priced for the caliber of food and service we received.  Maybe a throwback of previous owners? Or not quite season yet?  Either way, I say GO TRY THIS PLACE and tell your friends.  It's a jewel in North Scottsdale and a must-visit place!
2	Od3gR8RRZlETmIEqverbNg	When we first walked into this McDonalds last night, it was definitely a nicer looking establishment vs other ones that I've seen in the past. Unfortunately my first impression was ruined by the unnecessarily rude lady behind the counter. Besides our french fries being delivered cold, I was surprised to hear "that they weren't serving ice cream at night". Then the guy behind me somehow gets a McFlurry. When I asked why, they said that was their last one. So why didn't I get the last one if he was behind me?
2	yHFNUljefiEWEC6eqfieQ	On our way to Columbis,SC for business my colleague and I wanted to stop for a top notch meal. So we yelped the area as we drove down the highway. This place got rave reviews so since we are both foodies we pointed our GPS in this direction and went. What a horrible experience!! I am not sure if the waitress thought two women were not worth her time or what. We never got an amuse-bouche, had to beg for bread. We got our meal long after others who arrived long after we did. Then we decided to order one last item, the waitress' response; "This will fill you up or do you need more?" Our waitress was an older woman who looked southern european. Now the food- the zucchini flowers with marscarpone had so many flavors going on it was too busy. Not to mention SCAULDING hot!!!! So hot it couldn't be enjoyed. The tomato bisque I ate at Applebees the day before was so much better than their pomodoro suopa. Everything was too hot to enjoy or tasteless. at 28-35.00 a main course the experience was lost on us. I would not suggest visiting a 2 star restaurant with 5 star prices.
4	2Gb6HmuUAgweghd3JiCLLQ	I was pleasantly surprised! We got the #5 and #17 (Ham and Tuna), both of which were really tasty! Their sourdough and wheat are good. The facility was clean and the employees seemed really down to earth. Definitely better service than Subway.
2	vFpIsfmfFHr9RzzkMyuXww	I really like Panera, but like Amy R, I've had a bad experience with this location. The service strikes me as being ill-equipped to deal with the crowds, and they can get a little fussy about any requests that are slightly out of the ordinary. For instance, I had a teabag in my coffee cup the last time I was in there, and I asked if I could get some hot water. The woman behind the counter really, really didn't want to get me hot water, and then she charged me the same price as she would have for tea. It was pretty lame.  That said, I have business in that area of town, so I kind of find myself drawn to the yummy sandwiches and free wireless.
2	oH9O1faDSltKD4lCbuUQtg	I fell like I used to get a craving for this place from time to time but that seems to be gone now.  This place is dirty.  I've seen the one cashier drop change on a pizza slice and pick it off like its no big deal.  The pizza has the potential to be good when it's cooked right and it is fresh.  I really like their garlic dip.  However, I just can't do it anymore.  The last few times the pizza has definitely felt like it was sitting out far too long.
4	2DVb6AO8bRrjhbwOhnAUw	I kind of like this place. Very clean, good service. I played it safe with some Teriyaki chicken and their chow mein special (shrimp, chicken, & beef), because my girlfriend and her kid think of Panda Express when they want Chinese food, but I got her to admit this food was better.   Also, for those who care, they don't use MSG.
2	U3SwdVzdmq8bJTv4nQ8zA	While waiting for my next flight, I decided to head to Salsarita's since I was craving Mexican food, and didn't want the typical fast food burger or Starbuck's.  I ordered steak tacos with a side of chips and salsa.  The steak tacos tasted weird - almost as if the steak was pork.  The chips and salsa were ok, nothing special.
4	YqpclG5uUAGGP7TllDYeKw	Restaurant/bar that used to be a church.  Mmm... sacrilicious.  miss l's review is right on - beer is pretty tasty, the spinach/cheese artichoke dip is great, i don't think i had anything else to eat.... i'm sure locals come here somewhat regularly but def. the kind of novelty place you're sure to find visitors esp. on weekends.  like me.
4	0oHhuG8gpByr2rlaM4D9w	Don't ever judge a book by its cover. This little hole in the wall joint on a shady looking lot offers the best Cuban food I've ever tasted.  Prices are reasonable, the staff is reasonably friendly and the service is prompt. I went in for lunch to try them out and see if they were worth while. I ordered the Bistec Criollo, which was diced steak with chopped vegetables. The portions were quite generous, and left me thoroughly stuffed. The entree came with white rice, a delectable black bean soup, and some tasty bread rolls. The meat was juicy and plentiful and the seasoning was delightful. I strongly recommend this mom 'n pop joint to anyone who is located on Las Vegas blvd who is craving authentic cuban cuisine.
2	t9XIEmYpdntwK3ZIE1DwwQ	Corporate mexican food? Kill me now!  On our most recent trip to Vegas, my gf and I were looking to get a quick bite and we saw this spot. Here goes;  The GOOD: The decor is nice, pretty spot. I think that's what wooed us. We sat at the bar, so we were waited by the bartender, nice guy. Quick service.  The BAD: The food. It's as bland as rice cakes.   The UGLY: The fact that in such an amazing food city...we ended up here :(
4	V7UTU1GvsHUsWFzfnMh3mg	This is my favorite Subway.   I come here maybe once a week and each time the ingredients are fresh and the workers are so happy and pumped when you walk in.  At so many other Subway's i've been to they seem so glum and upset to be there.  I'm so glad this one is in my backyard and so reliable!!
2	7HKsfr0kLfhWFyeNNLQ	I try.. Really I do. But I am a ToGo's girl. I grew up with my #9 pastrami sandwich. This location was fast, they did good with our food, well as good as you can with processed meats. :/ My only complaint is the layout of the store. Could have been configured better. I only gave it 2 stars because when I do eat here, I always get sick. Now if I lost weight, I'd give them a star back! Haha!
2	lJjUJtPpGD0BI30Sh2Ulw	My Husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago.  It was 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, maybe two or three tables were occupied.    We were there with another couple and ordered several margaritas, their combination platter and a side of guajillo mashed potatoes.  We ordered several different tacos, but the ones I was interested were the Camarones a la Diabla and the Fresh Lobster tacos.  The shrimp was WAY too spicy to enjoy.  I like a lot of heat in my food, but not when it overwhelms everything else.  On the other hand, the lobster and jimaca was bland and lackluster.  I would have to say their selection of tequilas are nice.  I had their Cucumber Margarita and it was very cool and refreshing.  We may come back if I get a hankering for margaritas, if nothing else.  Also, I thought we would be in for an inexpensive night, but I guess with the combo platter, four margaritas and a couple of beers, it came out to be just over $80 a couple.
2	cKBDydIaXUaKdVDE6HE0Q	This was no one's first choice for eats but we skipped Schwartz's due to the line and even had to bail on Santropol due to a 45+ minute wait.  Did I mention it was bitter cold?  We wandered to Else's figuring, corrrectly that we would find an open table.  The food was meh but it was warm in there.  I think its more of a bar but we just got hot cider and tea with our chili.  75% of our group got chili because the waitress couldn't figure out  how to work the oven for the other food we ordered.  The tofu dip was good.
4	bbD4EhDbYJmuU0JLy8oAQ	Buca Di Beppo is a chain restaurant and for that I dock a star, but they do have great Itailian food.  Everything is family style so dont be surprised when the prices look high, almost every portion serves between 2 and 5 people.  I went on a business dinner with 8 of us and service was great.  Since they are used to handling big groups of people, our orders were nothing new.  Nice to be able to have a good meal with lots of people and finally not complain about the service.  Decent wine selection, tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere.
4	yhgtCxdtQRx6di5AYrkBfw	Nice outdoor seating, good drink collection, very good hummus, and a very funny menu. I have only had the hummus and a tasty wheat beer (Southampton Double White) for lunch so my experience with the menu is limited, but what I had was solid good. The hummus is recommended; comes with a mix of warm pita bread and crispy pita bread. The crispy pita is on the heavier side, fried, but is very tasty. Others in my party had various items, including cheesy balls and salads, and seemed satisfied.      The service deserves far less than four stars. It took forever for them to take our orders at the beginning and then forever again to get our checks at the end. Granted, we were a party of ten or more but the restaurant was not crowded. I am still giving it four stars, though, as this might be an off day for our server.   The outdoor porch on a summer day is excellent. Beautiful location to experience the Mount Washington neighborhood.
2	MDXsbWtxeLflEQ8r91O6Q	I should remember to check the reviews first! I am not sure why this place has so many customers eating here, because it certainly does not deserve the clientele! I had a chicken club with Cesar salad. I  asked for Cesar salad and got fries, sent it back once and the salad was pre-made and soggy, with some fries underneath. The toasted bread was soft as it appeared to be pre-made, the tomatoes were old and dried out, the lettuce wilted and one piece of over cooked bacon crumbled and spread over the sandwich. The chicken breast was a thinly sliced piece of a chicken breast that barely made it through the entire sandwich. Needless to say not a good sandwich. Thank goodness the soup was ok, or I would have to find another place to eat! The service was short and abrupt. If you are looking for a Denny's style of restaurant, this place would qualify!
4	RBPjfZEF0pOEfGjFvxrcHg	Inside this is your average run in, grab your grub & go kinda place; nothing fancy AT ALL.  But you come here for the food, NOT the ambiance.  What you get @ Lotus is good Chinese food quick.  And LARGE amounts of it, especially at dinner.  We at here for dinner tonight and we both had trouble finishing our meals (but I did because I was a pig...there, I said it!).  I ordered my Sa Cha Chicken with double fried rice no egg roll (cooked cabbage is just gross to me), and my God...I had enough rice for 3-4 people - and that's not an exaggeration!!  I was completely shocked at the amount of chicken and veggies that I was given - it could have easily been considered a "buffet portion" by other establishments.  Next time I know to have them alter the spice level though; I was about to spit fire!!!  But talk about TASTY.  It's been several years since I've eaten here & I forgot how good they were.  Used to eat here quite often when I worked @ IBM in the mid-late 90's (so you know they're good if they've been around that long).  And the best part is they're open somewhat late (till 10:00 Sun-Thur & 10:30 Fri & Sat), so you can quench that Chinese craving into the *somewhat* wee hours of the evening.   Pricing is also very reasonable.  For this mound of food, it was only $7.75 (on their dinner combo menu, +tax of course).  Naturally, they do have things priced slightly higher, but nothings over $10.75. And considering their portion sizes, that's a good value.  There are a few places to sit inside, but 95% (or maybe even more) of their business is take out.  And if you go in the evening (say, after 9:00 or so), be prepared for the stench of bleach as that's when they start cleaning - that scent slapped us in the face when we walked in this evening...WOW...appetizing!! Overall, I'd say Lotus is the best value in Chinese take-out in the Davis Lake area.  Give'em a try if you haven't already...and have your Tupperware\u2122 ready if you don't have a big stomach!! hehe :)
2	uHfyzoyBL6GpcUzP77ifA	Very confusing lunch menu.  I came here with a few friends and we all decided to order from their lunch (special?) menu.  From what I read (the English menu), my meal would come with coleslaw for the price as listed and I would be able to pick a side, so I decided to go for the side salad since I did not consume any vegetables for the past week or so.  After explaining to the waitress what I wanted in English, she said it would be fine and we soon got our meals shortly after.  The food was mediocre and I would have given them 3 stars if it wasn't for their mistake on the bill.    The waitress had misunderstood my order and charged me for the extra side salad even though my menu item was supposed to come with the coleslaw in the first place, and a side salad as a side.  Her English wasn't too great and I honestly did not have time to argue, so I ended up giving a mediocre 13% tip and leaving the restaurant quite discontent, knowing that I paid $16.50 for a very sub-par meal.
2	8HbyNpCltgCpQokYAcnZDw	Great location.  Name, decor, the menu, everything looks to be so promising, yet the food does not live up to it's potential.  I ordered the filet skewer, which was about 12 dollars, and a drink, and the total came to about 15 bucks.  I also asked if I can have the yogurt sauce, thinking it would come with the food, as it's a Greek place and all.  I guess I was wrong, since they charged me fifty cents for it.  The food was delivered to my table fairly quickly, by a charming young man who definitely improves the experience here.  Anyhow, I took a bite of my potatoes and immediately, my face turned blue.  The flavoring was so off, and salty and sour, I was sure the potatoes were stuffed with sour patch kids.  So I shifted my attention to the beef that was on my plate, and it too was again, too salty and sour.  C'mon guys, lemons are pricey these days, quit squeezing five lemons on top of every plate!  I'll stop here while I'm still ahead (alive), because honestly, the owner looked pretty buff and scary.  Enjoy
2	JKSiPoonlug1JBzj1zSnLQ	There was a serious lack of personality, and polite customer service in our past visit.   The cashier didn't bother with a hello or good morning, just a what can I get for you.  Ok, fine, whatever, but we hadn't even looked at the menu yet.  When the bf and I were discussing with each other what we were thinking of ordering, eager beaver cashier girl took that as us talking to her and started trying to ring things in... mind you, we were a good 5 ft away from the counter, facing each other and using our "library voices".  Obnoxious!  They also had the lines laid out differently and forced you to walk through people sitting trying to eat at the high tops in order to get to your order and drinks. Very awkward.  My egg white sandwich was supposed to have tomatoes on in per the menu... it had 2 sad could of been a tomato at one point tomatoes on one side of the sandwich.   What I find to be interesting is... if you order a lunch sandwich you get a cookie. If you order a breakfast sandwich, you don't.... what the h man? Just because it is 9 am doesn't mean I am not jonesin' for a cookie!     The saving grace of this visit.... a random offensive, yet hilarious giant cookie on display which provided tons of laughs.
2	GjIWEm7oW1Emwq9X3LZzuA	I have not ordered Pizza Hut in a long time.  When it's busy it can take up to two hours to get some food delivered.  I decided to give this place another try and order for lunch hoping it wouldn't be as busy.  I was actually impressed.  The food came when it was supposed to arrive.  I did not get a single call from a delivery person crying to me about being lost either.  Get this, the food was actually hot enough to burn my tounge, just how I like it.  I never expect my delivery food to be hot, no matter where it comes from.  This may not be the place for dinner because it is just so damned busy, but lunch, not so bad.  Update.  This must have been a fluke because I ordered again for lunch thinking I'd get the same decent service, but sadly no.  I ordered and was given a thirty minute time frame for delivery.  An hour later I called the place and was told the driver was allready gone.  Fifteen minutes later the guy shows up, even though the place is less than three miles away.  Nothing was hot or fresh.  Again it was 2:30 on a Wednesday, they should not have been busy.  Epic fail.
2	5sFwIG2Mo5xLA3XWvDrP4g	Much more casual than expected.  (Everything is served on paper/styro plates/bowls.)  The food is very average.  None of it is bad, but not great either.  I had a Greek Chicken pita.  It was somewhat dry and bland and pretty small for $8.  The cole slaw was unique, but good.  Service was very average as well...not overly friendly by any means.  My wife got the salad sampler with chicken salad.  It was just okay as it didn't have a lot of flavor.    Overall, Zoe's was very average and slightly over priced for what you receive.  For close to $20 for 2, I would much rather got to Pita Jungle for healthy wraps and pitas.
2	gRl7fVHr8LsuGFUOlFUig	So we decide to meet our friends out for dinner at the Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill.  We pull up on a Saturday evening only to find out that it closes at 5pm.  With limited options we drive through town looking for something serviceable.  We wind up at Uncle Bears.  It seems safe and we can watch the NCAA tourney on tv.  The place has this strange infatuation with dogs that borders on creepy.  That was the only thing that was really distinctive.  Everything else was about as suburban as the cookie cutter houses that surrounded this strip mall.  The menu came from 123 Anywhere street if you know what I mean.  You've seen everything on the menu and the dishes were average, unimaginative, and bland.  Our waitress, bless her heart, was having a difficult evening.  Her visits were sporadic at best and we spent an extra 20 minutes sorting out our bill, she accidentally gave our tab to another table.   Suffice to say, the next time we are this far out it will be because we got the hours right at the Olive Oil Mill.   At least our company was good.
2	75rQ6RJuxgLa9EkD8SpCw	My wife and I went here on Sunday (the line for Coco Cafe was too long) and we had quite an interesting experience. I'll start with the simple stuff: the food. I had a burrito with potatoes, eggs, and something else (though they were out of avocados so the one I really wanted was a bust) and it was fine. Nothing special. My wife had the peasants breakfast which was tasty, but also nothing to really rave about.   The interesting part was the service. I don't know if this was a Sunday thing or the norm, but there was only one employee working that day. One employee for the kitchen and the front of the house. Meaning, this guy would take our order, go to the kitchen, cook it, and bring it out. No help of any kind. This was fine when it was just me and my wife, but once other folks started showing up, he was very much overwhelmed. At one point, the guy (I'm pretty sure he was the owner) told one couple that it would be at least 20 minutes before he could even take their order and told another group of three that they should just leave and go to Eat N' Park since it would be faster that way.  So, it's a cute cafe, with mediocre food, and, um, interesting service.   Would I go there again? Nah. I'd rather wait the 45 min for Coco Cafe or go to Dozen when it reopens.
2	b053E08KyMMYoVEYLzAqcQ	Sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow.  I ordered 3 rolls, it took 20 minutes to get the first one, and they served them one at a time. It wasn't crowded, I was the only one at the sushi bar.   Go to Ginbu 401 instead.
4	m3gWIdwrJQHfh8RClibLA	Lately I've noticed two things.  First, the friendliness of the staff at Chick-Fil-A has gone up exponentially.  I don't think it's just one store in particular, because it seems to be at all locations (or at least all of them we visit).  Second, the fries are tasting better.  It's not that the fries themselves are different, because they look or even really taste new, but they seem to be letting them cook longer, which leads to crispier fries, instead of those nasty limp waffle things that they used to put out.  Now I just need to make sure to remember to ask for "well done" fries just in case, and I think I can actually grow to like these Chick-Fil-A fries... I still don't really care for the spicy chicken, however.  I can let them slide on that as long as they offer hot sauce on the condiment bar and free chicken once a year, however.
2	NZbAEDtfozxrfzPBrhfdA	It's sad. I had a reasonably pleasant croissant two days ago and was very pleased with the quality of the baguettes. I bought two and they were delicious.   HOWEVER. The cappuccino was a piece of mess. It was more close to a caffe latte. It wasnt even a foamy latte. Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed. I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water. very heavy in texture. Could not finish it.   But since the baguette was the reason I had gone there for the first place, i give them two stars. Want to try their opera and other sweet pastries. but i will just order a doppio espresso. No no cappuccinos.
4	63xWOKKOhGd4gLlI1QAw	Rolled in during a trip to a Pirates game.  Great service & an absolute jumping crowd.  We were told after 11:00 the place gets jammed and like clockwork it did.  Great people watching spot.  Get upstairs if there is room and watch the Magen down below.
2	K9FjQMVSpb0fzSfTnrwZw	The ballroom, as the name suggests, provides a grand atmosphere for lunch.  But the food is done by University Dining Services -- the same people that cater meetings and events so badly.  The motto could be:  "A dorm dining hall without the dorm."  The one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern-ness.  I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast.  Miniature marshmallows!   Fruit salad with... is that mayonnaise?  The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952.  But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found.    It's expensive for the quality of the food.  The salad bar is tolerable.  The main dishes range from poor to horrible.  The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread.  If you like to snicker at such things, apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes.  This leads to platters marked as "White Soup," "Spring Salad" or my favorite: "Ethnic Dish."  Note that the previous price listed is out of date.  It is now $8.75 for buffet, drink, and dessert.
4	RADksYV2BkUQKjSnzjLqgQ	Each time I visit Houlihan's I am reminded of how much I enjoy it! The menu is excellent and the taste of the food is even better. All of the prices are quite reasonable, especially during happy hour, which is one of the best! The half-price deals on drinks and good deals on delicious apps makes visiting Houlihan's from 5-7pm an irresistible deal.  I always visit each summer for my birthday, when I am offered a buy one, get one deal on entr\u00e9es, which is a great deal.  As someone who lives in the city, I most often visit the Station Square location, which has a nice view of the city and an outdoor seating option that I like. The only downside is having to pay for parking in the garage. Years ago Houlihan's validated parking and that was a nice perk for that location.
4	WLLhcYiFW3zInJ9va39yQ	This has to be one of the best restaurant around for chinese food or maybe I'm just a little biased.  During weekends, the next room holds a live karaoke and that's where I fell in love with this place.  The food is just as good!  I normally order the scallion pancakes, the hot won ton soup and chinese spinach and it's always tasted so good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.. highly recomended place for sure!
2	yb52b2hDBSRRkJ2oepKKA	i just started a new job that orders from here fairly frequently, so i decided to try it one day.  i ordered the chicken caesar wrap and a diet coke.  i don't know how you can screw those things up, but that's what happened. i'll probably give it another shot, but i will definitely order something different!
4	mqy2EOHlMqSDmpVR3W07BQ	I went here about a week ago with the boy for breakfast. It was a cloudy day here in Phoenix, and we made the mistake of sitting out on the covered patio. It would have been LOVELY since it was nice and cool outside, but after we received our drinks (me, iced tea; the boy, freshly squeezed oj) and our basket o' mini muffins, it started to POUR.  The "covering" thing they have over the patio is more of a mesh to filter sunlight, as opposed to an actual solid covering type material. Our table starting to get super wet. We were sitting next to another couple who decided they were going to stick it out and finish their breakfast, but since the boy and I hadn't received our actual meals yet, we decided to check and see if we could sit inside.  They were happy to give us a table inside, and actually made a few jokes about how crazy we were to sit out there in the first place considering how cloudy/stormy it looked. We received our food shortly after being seated on the INSIDE of the restaurant. The boy got the farm special? country special? something like that, it came with pancakes, scrambled eggs, and sausage. I got whatever the other special was that was DELICIOUS potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon and scrambled eggs.  Our breakfast was wonderful. I loved how all the dishes and everything we mismatched, a very cute country look. Our server was fantastic. I'm sure we'll go back again. :)
2	9DzOmhDKywUtnLvmOJbgbg	Nice and clean place. But this is pretty it. We ordered the Fishsoup, which is supposed to be a house specialty and bah was it bad. The broth tasted like water with red hot pepper flakes. No taste at all!! There were only 2 tiny pieces of Monkfish and as for the rest a little raddish and a whole bunch of cropped beansprouts.I guess the owner realized it and he brought a little dish with soy sauce and wasabi. I was in a state of shock. We did not order Sushi..we ordered Fishsoup! And we payed 14 bucks for this s***? The best part of our dinner were the side dishes. One was a green pepper and we were two people.When my husband jokingly asked why only one, the answer was that they thought that I would not eat it. What the ..?...You get 6 side dishes, not much for a Korean place and for that I better go elsewhere...
4	GRhoTWhlpbFDzyUAHSuVw	Family and I had breakfast here a week ago. I remembered eating here with my parents when I was just a tot, and thought I would take a trip down memory lane.  My son was happy to see chicken and waffles on the menu and tried that. My husband and I both chose fried eggs, bacon, toast and french fries for our potato choice. We ordered aside of brown gravy to go with the fries. Everything came out quick and hot. We were satisfied with the taste, tge large portions and the value for the price. My son's chicken strips and waffle were really good and my husband and I especially enjoyed the fries and gravy.
4	hJrpxY2dNtVBgY1zYRKmRw	Clean restaurant.  Fast service.  Good breakfast.  I only had the oatmeal but it was good and cheap.  The iced tea was fresh.  My friend had bacon (looked thick and perfectly cooked), eggs and hashbrowns.  I recommend!
2	CZ4dbGg1rLMgoM6mwrfiyg	A fresh, airy and modern interior doesn't detract from the below average food and drink available at the Metropole. Like so many aesthetically appealing cafe's, they often don't have the quality of service nor food to back up their image.  I had a weak and luke-warm coffee here and an equally naff panini. Not particularly expensive but not particularly good either. A bit transparent.
4	Vqz6knEZVOHT4FYQgyElQ	The best catfish in town. Love the Mac and cheese and banana pudding too. Don't love the parking lot but during the day have had no problems. The clerks in the hot food section are very nice and friendly.
2	DYNV4U1rsANXVmUwOjo4eg	The lentil soup was good, although lentil soup in general is hard to mess up. I want to be very clear about the falafel, however. It was flat out awful. Didn't try the hummus. The bread was okay. The baklava was unfortunately very soggy, not very good at all. On th bright side, they let us stay til 11pm and we weren't the only ones there, the place has a good atmosphere and nice, attentive waitstaff. I wouldn't come here again for mediterranean food. Lastly, my gf had the stuffed eggplant and she said it was ok--the rice pilaf was cooked well but needed more almonds. The eggplant was nothing special.
4	e0lZwXuiyDNej5SOLAdA	I had dinner here this week, and while waiting for my dine-in order, I checked on here to see what people had to say.  My response?  "Oh, crap."  Fortunately for me, I didn't have the customer service nightmare that other reviewers had.  So that leads me to believe that the issue must be either with: take-out, delivery, or someone that works here got the memo and decided to work on their customer service techniques.  If anything, the service was very friendly.  Quick, talkative, checked in often to see how we were doing... they even stopped us when we went to select our drinks as the colder drinks were in the back of their fridge.  Why? They wanted to point those out over the still warm ones they had recently placed in there.  Again, little gestures.  We got two personal pizzas: Cordon Bleu and Cajun Queen.  And those were some really tasty 'zas, especially sharing between ourselves.  Someone else on here pointed out this place's wings, and I am a HUGE wing enthusiast.  These are definitely some mighty fine wings.  I ate those like they were going out of style.  I don't know what to say: The meal was really good, the service contradicted the other reviews on here (which was a relief for us), and yes, the prices are a little high, but the quality and variety was there.
2	O1pk6lxrTI0zJrdQuXhIEQ	Why do so many people think this is a good franchise? These are the most bland, disappointing burgers I've ever had from any chain. Let me document the three tries I've given it.  Strike 1-Burger with Swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms and bacon. Sounds like an amazing burger, but it was just bland and greasy.  Strike 2-Bleu Ribbon burger with onion straws, blue cheese, and steak sauce. I didn't know anything with blue cheese on it could still be so boring. Yawn.  Strike 3-A vegetarian quesadilla and guacamole bacon burger. The quesadilla looked awesome, stuffed with mushrooms and whatnot, but I had to dip it in guac to give my tastebuds the slightest hint of satisfaction. They should stop using cheap, mild cheese and maybe actually season the stuff instead of giving your 4 different toppings for it. Also, the burger sucked. It doesn't matter if it says "Oregano seasoned patty" or "cayenne" or whatever--they all taste the same. Not to mention telling the waitress "well done" and getting meat with plenty of pink.  I want to give you 1 star so bad, but you try to be good, especially with the vegetarian substitutions available. I hope your patrons wake up and realize there are exponentially better burgers in several locations within walking distance.
4	fity42JPqtZ3k80EAdFQ	on the outside, this place look like all the other mom and pop Chinese food joint. "China this.".. "Dragon that " type of restaurant. I wasn't particularly interested going in except  friends I was with had been there before, they couldn't stop praising how good this place was. (besides they are buying, so I didn't have much to say)   Once inside, The decor is much better than the typical mom and pop, not elegant, but better than the average Chinese joint. Look clean.  Personally I don't the the Americanized version of Chinese food. I much rather have Hong Kong style Chinese food. I find their food is Americanized yet retain authentic Chinese food flavor - surprise me. For that reason, I give them a four star. Other than that, this place is pretty much like all the other mom and pop joint.  Over all, I think it is good food, good value.
4	CAU28Ak8LulQjNUQib9odg	For anyone in Scottsdale, you have to try this place... The Arabic chopped salad, hummus and stuffed eggplant are DELICTIBLE!  I visit this restaurant every time I am in AZ. The owner is a doll and really makes you feel at home.  It is a small restaurant so I suggest calling to make a reso.
2	HmeFcVx8gWFqJOq0ejBAw	Save your money and go to Paradise Bakery in the food court. Same quality of food for 1/2 the price.  I had the turkey cranberry sandwich and the chicken soup. The sandwich was actually quite bland and the soup wasn't much better. For nearly $20 for a soup and sandwich, I was expecting some wow.  Just cuz it's Nordies doesn't mean it's quality.
4	OWELiBF1nNltovsLawdG1g	Huge variety of fresh salads, fruits, soups and some other delicacies and all for only 8 bucks. Place is not really welcoming but it's clean and the service is OK. I'm not a fan of buffets but this one is recommendable!
4	iSMhcqJjQfds3DYIOMcrQ	this pizza tastes just like peter piper pizza.. except the games and such.. awesome crunchy wings prices are great.. they have live shows on special days.. really great staff.. the wibe is great. great atmosphere
4	8cA9uDcjh9eict7bb479GQ	I used to regularly eat their pizza when I was younger & spent my summers here at my grandparents house. I haven't been back in years & I honestly expected a huge change in flavor, but was pleasantly surprised to find that they still had great pizza.   I would definitely recommend having a few slices. They're soft and crunchy. Yum!
4	ZSIJCBuEiqCouEYF3agQ	Great neighborhood bar for before/after games. Very good food. Not the best, but it's a bar. If you want a fancy restaurant, this is clearly not a good option, but if you want a good meal before the game or concert and some drinks with good prices, this is a very good option around CONSOL Energy Center.
4	bfotXJWatEkHOYybzhZdag	I tend to gravitate towards the old style, mom and pop, greasy spoons for breakfast and steer clear of the chain restaurants. This Village Inn is an exception. It's been here a while, some workers have been there for 15 years and know their customers. It's well kept, clean and friendly. Did I mention the food is actually good? This place has steady business for a reason. My only complaint is wifi only allowed me to upload 10% of my YouTube video. I think I'll survive.
4	6zUOeo1yWVPMbdN4uSDtfw	We decided to trek out of our usual today and head over to the land of pancakes.  The parking was a little cramped, but that was probably because of the church bookstore next door.  We got inside and were seated right away.  I didn't like that the waitress brought us little cups of water, and no straws.  I prefer to drink out of a straw, because you never know where the cup has been.  After reading through their enormous selection, we both finally decided on fruit pancakes (she had blueberry, I had strawberry) and a side of potatoes.  Boy, was ordering the potatoes a horrible idea!  When the waitress brought out the food, my stomach flopped.  The portion size of the pancakes is incredible!  Four huge pancakes smothered in blueberry/strawberry compote, whipped cream, and real fruit!  Time to dig in...  The pancakes were AMAZING.  I had as much as my tummy could possibly hold.  The potatoes were average, and tasted pretty good with salt and smothered in ketchup.  Paired along with the coffee we had, I would say I am going to be full until tomorrow.  Extremely good pancakes, friendly service, and causal atmosphere.  A little on the spendy side for pancakes and coffee - we spent $14 each.  Sure is different during the daylight hours.  I usually end up here after a night of partying.    I will definitely go back!
2	Qf4DO6TkaP5ZMjzGj8n4w	We ordered chicken Lettuce wrap for a meal and needed little more lettuce. So I asked to bring more , was told they don't give out free extra lettuce. I said ok just bring some we'll pay. We got about 5 tiny lettuce leaves and they charged 2 dollars for that. I talked to the owner that charge was too much. She completely ignored me and walk away.......
2	JBb5MR1odvGF967bcMm8LQ	Well, first off I did not know what kind of place this was when I went in. We thought the name looked cool, and the place is new. Turns out it is kind of a "Hooters" with Scottish theme. So all the waitresses are young women wearing outfits that cover as little skin as possible.  The place is not very family friendly in my opinion. Totally a place for guys who think waitresses in low cut bras are a necessary thing.  Apart from that, the food was a bit over priced for what you got. My "Fish and Chips" had cold/room temp fries. And it was nothing special in terms of quality.  Needless to say, I won't be eating there again. Not really into the ogling ladies in public while eating average food thing.
4	c5gglfEfL8anMqyuEK9btw	Food seems to be hit and miss. The kugel was very good if a little pricey for the portion. The brisket was incredibly dry, but the roll, sauce and pickle were all good.  4 Stars for anyone who brings me chicken kneidel soup when I feel like this. I might be able to do homework now.
2	9ssedwj8uDWhMn5Qj5MAqA	I ordered room service from the Bigelow Grille since I am staying at the Double Tree. I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the spicy tomato soup, the Bigelow Burger, and a side salad. The only reason it gets two stars is for how good the spicy tomato soup was. I'd rather have a large bowl of that than order the burger. The burger was below average - no toppings other than cheese and a slice of tomato.  I ordered the burger medium rare and I received a well done burger. It was pretty thin and not juicy.  My side salad was missing the dressing I ordered.  Needless to say, I'll be going elsewhere for my dinners.
2	uhl1h2JWfhuklGVakYTA	I was sent for training on Olive Avenue and this sushi bar was right across the street.. The food was okay... I've had better and I've had worse... The prices were pretty good... The server, though, was not. I went with 2 of my other coworkers and one of my coworkers asked for eel sauce; the serve thought it was within her right to question the request and THEN snub her nose and make the snide remark "Well your the one eating it".... on top of that... definitely not a fan about the automatic gratuity... a tip is privilege and something that has to be earned... its not an entitlement... So... 1 point off for the lousy service, 1 point off for that snide comment, and 1 point off for their gratuity.... will I go there again? The prices were decent, food was okay, and the quantity was a lot; but no, I doubt I will ever go there again... I don't eat sushi that much anyways and there are a lot of other places in the area where I can spend my hour lunch break-- that is if I have training there ever again. Will definitely not go out of my way for this place.
4	jmpmB4uk4xUWBbZR70lIQ	This is a Fantastic place for good quality ,BIG quantity dinners. Nestled in a quaint little shopping center near Castle Shannon , no parking problems , fast easy seating , not too noisey , very nice menu. very reasonable prices. friendly staff. Defiantly not a hipster place ,  nice bar. Clean dinning area and rest room.
4	tSiBAiFXTTuhRaXiOK1Ktg	We chose this place based on high Yelp reviews for dinner before our girls night out. Looks like a hole in the wall place in a sorta sketchy area but I felt safe in a group.  This was a two man show on Saturday night. The hostess/waitress/bartender/cashier was awesome and the cook has serious skills!  The margaritas were $7 and made from fresh fruits and great quality tequila...best margaritas I've had in a long time...and not the sugary syrupy kind! Everyone's dinners were perfect and the homemade chips and salsa were delish. I highly recommend this place...I will be back!
2	hADocWwq10R3OwxxYoBdHQ	So San-E-Tize (as I like to call it) has been staring at me every time I go to F&E and I finally convinced my wife to try Thai food.  We went over here on a Saturday night and I was totally excited for a new place.  But then the bad service started.  We were seated, then ignored, then we got drinks, and were ignored again.  Then we were asked if we were ready to order (which we were) and then ignored again.  This was getting a little old. I finally ordered a Sweet Basil something with chicken.  It was a runny mess that was lacking in meat.  It needed noodles or rice or something to thicken the dish up.  It really just wasn't very good. I ordered it with a #4 spicy level and it was about there (maybe a 2 or 3 in my book).  I don't know if the 6 is insane or not but I don't know who would be willing to ruin their meal just to try and find out. In the end, I wasn't really impressed.  The large tables are just comical, the service is sub-par, and the food was just blah.  I posted a picture of my meal just for reference.  I might go back and try something with rice next time but this was just not what I wanted.
2	VPx0sPHhZqlmWTYewGBWw	This place is great if you don't mind waiting obscenely long time for drinks.  We visited this place because we wanted a martini before dinner. We ordered a dirty martini and a Bombay sapphire martini (extra $3 during the 5-7pm happy hour--martinis free with each order of tapas, something like that).  We order the fried potatoes with rosemary and fried calamari.  Both were good, tasty, light and would have gone perfectly with the martinis had we got them in time.  It took over 30 minutes to get our drinks. When we got them, the dirty martini was more like a olive juice and gin.  To the waiters' credit, they were very accommodating, took the dirty martini back and replaced it, free of charge.  they earned their tip for sure.
4	1PVCbS61Xd6zcdxSXMcYw	Decided to have lunch here today solely based on the reviews. My family usually goes to Garcia when we want really good Mexican food and this place is in a plaza I never really trusted. Well, I am very happy stopped in. I ordered the chimi and finished the meal.  The portion was huge and delicious. You will want to add either their green or red sauce as there is a lot meat but that's okay in my book. I will be back with the family. Thank you having really good Mexican food much closer to my home.
2	Y8GK7iJU0zTGpBa2hjmw	This was a sight for sore eyes on Sunday morning. I had a long Saturday night, so a gently-lit room with soft music was the perfect place to get my brunch on. The long line was discouraging, but the staff was speedy, and the ordering process was highly efficient. Take a number, and they'll find you.  No more than five minutes later, my order arrived with a smile. It was the advertised lunch item, the "BBLT". I thought the extra 'B' stood for the balsamic vinaigrette that ruined robust, locally-grown tomatoes, and I was wrong. It was emphasis on the supposedly generous portion of average bacon in the sandwich. In that aspect, it was mediocre.  To make matters worse, the mayo on the sandwich was...very acidic, to say the least. Wedged between what I believe to be lackluster sourdough, this sandwich tasted way too tart. I don't even like their bread, I can say with confidence it ain't up to snuff after visiting some REAL bakeries in this town.  So after looking at the menu online, I see they enjoy taking a simple breakfast/lunch food and spicing it up a little...they shouldn't try so hard. My stomach churns at the thought of them messing up the paninis. Maybe I'll be back to try a breakfast panini, as they were pretty cheap (chicken sausage and apple? Hmm...)  Basically, there are some decent items to be had here, I'm sure. But...can you find a better brunch or sandwich for around $10? If you're on Yelp, you already should have. The food is 'meh', but at least the service is great. And that black currant tea. I want a tank to myself.
2	HMyr7zpKeXVmYR4tpdn5lg	We went when it first opened and grabbed a couple pizzas to take home. They were good--turns out we loved the Rueben pizza! The sandwiches are ok.   Another time we called and they said they gave us a time to pick up our order, and still waited another 15 minutes. I called a couple weeks ago around 8:15 pm, and they told me they just closed because it was slow. Tonight I called to have a couple pizzas delivered, but was told they don't do delivery. I explained that the menu they gave me the last time I was in says "Take-out and Delivery". She responded that they don't have enough people there or people with cars, so they're not doing it.   It seems every time I try to order, there's another reason why they're unable to provide a pizza! They're just absolutely unpredictable!
4	pshhVbhOWcUUoGUBh6U9Q	We used to go here a lot years ago. But a move north a bit took it out of the flight path so... it was time to go back and check it out.  As always.... the owner/bartender/waiter/janitor/greeter was doing his thing running around and keeping us in drinks and food.  The drinks were good a always (no short pours here that i've had) and the food great. i didn't have but the burgers were big and juicy looking and the salad with cajun chicken was great. BEST honey mustard dressing i ever had.  Anyhow, glad i went and will be back sooner. It's small, with 6 tables and the 10 seat bar but... close friends and fun can be found here.  ENJOY IT.... and worth the trip for this small almost out of the way place.  I'd give it 5 stars but it was a bit noise (part of the charm except when you're trying to talk) and our waitress could have been better looking.  :-)  (sorry John)
2	dIgQFjjH4Yi3pkgRs6Eig	used to love this place. i hope it was an off night. was just ok sushi chefs were not friendly and food was average. they should consider changing the oil more often(black specks all over my caramari) and have the staff be friendlier. baked mussels were horrible just topped with a cold mayo. not baked but nuked  yuk. they were rushing us not sure why. i'll go back hope they improve. don't offer all you can eat if you don't want people to eat a lot.
2	WPJWxfQzR2tXsIzKwTpg	I so desperately want to like Cafe Roma. It is a small place with a take-out area and a dining room. When you walk it, it smells incredible. I have yet to have something that tastes like the smell.  I've had the Penne with meat sauce. The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was average. The lasagna is above average and threatens to be good, but doesn't quite make it.  The side salad is okay as far as such things go. It consists of mostly iceburg lettuce with a middle eastern type olive thrown in and a sprinkling of some kind of field green. The salad dressings I've tried are bottled.  There is a daily pasta special.
4	TVpMyQGHL2aT2gaXGyrNNw	My indoor soccer team goes here almost every week after our game, and I always enjoy it.  The only thing I've had is their $20 large-pizza-and-2-pitchers-of-beer special, but I must say their pizza is really tasty & much better than you'd expect from a sports bar.  Service is always good and it's the perfect place to chill out -- and the guys love all the TV's with sports playing.  Ambiance is what you would expect from a typical sports bar, but it's definitely a fun spot to go with friends.  Try the pizza and beer special, it's great! :)
4	J5CAOQFAo2D1Cey8YwFOw	Scummy area that smacks of bad news, but the staff has remarkable work ethic and the pizza is predictably good. I dig the crazy bread best. I would like to try the deep dish sometime. The gal working the register exchanged some small talk about hair dye and was really personable. The pizza and breadsticks didn't take long, and was the usual greasy + tasty combo I expect at Little Caesar's.
4	0QhqFMlkihlZCMPLqEJgg	Drove by a thousand times. Stopped in today, and most likely tomorrow.  Never have been to a Thai Basil before, which is strange because I do absolutely love Thai cuisine. Stopped in last night with my girlfriend for a dinner break from studying. Just wanted a quick bite to eat and got much more.  The menu was large and honestly hard to choose from. After several minutes trying to decide on a choice, I struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken. Trusting her, I ordered it and within 5 minutes I had a large, hot plate of it sitting in front of me. At the same time my girl landed herself some fried sweet potato skins with a delicious dipping sauce.   Both of use enjoyed every last bite of the meal. We topped off the dinner break with what else for a college student on a study break?!? The Thai Coffee. It is served iced and taste somewhere between chocolate milk, and burned coffee. Sound kinda weird? well it kinda took me by surprise, but we enjoyed every last drop.   Since this wonderful, new found Basil explosion is so close and I will definitely be back soon. Maybe tomorrow...  Btw... I heart basil
2	Mt0nGq9HNitEUkOU4ebWTQ	I wanted to take my boyfriend to a teppanyaki restaurant since he had never been to one before. This being the closest to us we decided to go here Sunday for our anniversary. It was ok.   The chef we had wasn't very entertaining, he didn't do the egg trick, and his onion volcano was lacking any resemblance to a volcano. Maybe I was just expecting too much. Having been to a couple teppanyaki places before and loved the whole experience.  The food was good but I'd definitely recommend another place for the future.
4	KjoYkPAvmSU1gsK1xwQdQw	Gal from work turned me onto this no-nonsense buffet. Seedy on the neighbor outside but clean and startling pink walls and 1960's curtain beads once you walk in. went with girlfriends from work for a quick all-u-can fill up styro container from the all you can eat buffet.  The place was crowded for lunch (that's a good sign) with a buffet being replenished frequently in our short 10 minutes there.  I'm a spice junkie so i have to say i was a little disappointed in the variety.  they served noodles, fried chicken (crispy, fresh, but not spicy), egg foo young, salad with noodles, sweet & sour chicken, veggies, and soup which apparently doesn't come with the takeout styro container.  Sweet and sour sauce was good, freshly made.  all in all, worth the 5 bucks for a solid, but non-spicy bufet you can order and eat in a short lunch break. +1 for being very clean!
2	wVgNnqUqOND6sfZgyq9SA	This pub was named as such because it is where the training medics and doctors would head to from the Old Medical School located right across the street. The romantic idea of Edinburgh in the past with scholars heading here after a long day doing scholarly stuff is quickly diminished as soon as you walk into this pub today. Its moved along since and hosts a variety of clientele of various ages, although predominately first year students-bushy eyed and full of energy(and student loans). I can't see why this place is a target, there are loads of bars near by also conveniently located, whose bar staff will not ignore you when ordering and whose prices are a lot more reasonable.    Head here in the afternoon for your neighbours episodes or for a rugby game on the screen, or else later at night, when the crowds have moved along. There's nothing really special to it I'm afraid.
4	Nj204PCJVcUyKMhNBY05qQ	Very good selection of sandwiches, with a very friendly staff to back it up. The place is obviously geared towards the college crowd, but it's still really nice for those of us who think we're grown up. Definitely a place I'll try again.
4	v52JLvMIchKZoiUShjhQQ	We were kid Free last night an decided to have a little date night. I figure if I spend more then $50 she will....well you know. LOL   We decided on dinner and a movie. Dinner was here at the Claim Jumper. This place has been here since the complex was built but still looks new inside and out.   The staff was friendly and helpful.   The food was large and delicious. We each had a burger. Mine was a little over cooked as I asked for Med rare but it was still juicy so I was okay with that. They cook a nice hunk of 1/2 Lb beef grilled not flat fried and add a ton of toppings if you wish. I had the bbq sauce cheese let tom 1000 island and Angie had the onion rings avocado cheese let and tom. They were darn good.   We each had a salad for the side. The Blue cheese and 1000 are both homemade and were really good. Angie had the Ranch but seemed to like the blue better.   The bar has a decent happy hour menu, might check it out.   PS we saw Get him to the Greek and thought it was funny but neither of us pee'd ourselves. LOL
4	p9BHxAOk6pRdPjLU1ASfw	Do not let the 60s decor fool you.  This is an excellent Chinese food restaurant. It specializes in Cantonese, which isn't as trendy Sichuan and Hunan, but the dishes are quality and have generous portions. The Hot and Sour soup and General Tzu's chicken are standout items.
4	YlgDjSw8sFoJ8eahE82LTw	It kind of pains me to give Panera Bread a good rating, mainly because I didn't want to go here for lunch this weekend but was talked into it. I have never been a huge fan of Panera because as many have mentioned its basically the Starbucks of the sandwich and soup market. Overcharging for something I can get cheaper elsewhere but if I want to be "cool" I have to eat at Panera. Ugh! So, with that said, I gave Panera 4 stars. They lose 1 star for price. Thats about it from this trip that I can really knock. The service was fine, the food was delicious (I ordered a chicken sandwich that had chipotle mayo I don't remember the name), and the place is really well kept. I even had a cinnamon bun to go that was great in the morning. I really wish they would lower the prices a bit or throw in the drink with a sandwich at the least. I mean really, fountain drinks cost them a few cents. Would it really kill them to include it? For $7 although my sandwich was good it was small and I ended up eating some of my moms and my girlfriends meals too.  Not sure if I will be back but I won't be as likely to fight it next time.
4	Dnt9rtiKGxDL7Ikrm66IWw	When you look for this place, you're looking for the sign that says "Golden Metropole" in the little shopping strip next to Dim Sum on Central Ave.  I used to trek over to Lang Van all the time to get my dose of pho, but I'm starting to think that this place may be better.  The broth has a more interesting flavor, and my perception, at least lately, has been that the quality of meat used in the pho is better.  Pho Hoa is a franchise chain, but each one is a little different and this one seems to have a few specials and items that are not part of the standard franchise menu.  Their menu is no more unusual than any other Charlotte Vietnamese restaurant, but they do it right and they open at 9:00 a.m. so that you can have pho for breakfast traditional stylee.
2	NAeWYp8QnYDR4OptzJZr6A	The atmosphere is fun and the service was good. The burger meat was good but the mushrooms are canned the cheese appears to be processed. The turkey sandwich was what gave it two stars. It was no better than one that came out of a vending machine.
2	BXJ0CKgyBEgd7EsWUmmbw	I think the rolls are overpriced. The sashimi platter is the best deal there.   The bar is incomplete. No Tanqueray. Who doesn't have Tanqueray? ESPECIALLY in the summer.   Some nights they have Dray and the Heavie Heads spin electro-rock-reggae-hip-hop in the open area in the back.   I think I've been there on some of the busy nights ... and its not that busy.   Decor is nice. But again. I don't eat decor.   p.s. What's the deal with all of the sushi joints on Sahara?   * off the strip, non-casino
4	2g3MhVCkA2IcgQZOFs6OQ	I worked at the Dairy Queen in this complex for 5 years and loved this place. I still go when I am in the area. Their breakfast sandwich croissants are sooo good! Get the bacon, egg and cheese croissant and you wont be disappointed. The service is not the best but they are super nice. They don't always pick the brightest crayons in the box for employees but they are giving high school kids the chance to work, which is fine with me. This place is good and deserves at lease a try. I would take their breakfast sandwiches over the crap at a Starbucks or Einstein's.  Give it a try if you are in the area.
2	vH7aMDYxrFQ4iy59QAhNyQ	Night life is good. Great music.   Bartenders are pretty cool. Security not so much. Keep your hands off me or at least take me to dinner first if you want man love. Jesus Christ.   They throw napkins in the air...is confetti too expensive?? An incarcerated person who was wrongfully accused working for 10 cents an hour made that napkin. What a waste.  Most of the women are pretty hot too but only due to a lack of clubs at Westgate so they all go to McFaddens.
2	vQhX4ziavOuv4WParPJozw	WHAT are you thinking Gardunos????  Used to enjoy the enchiladas, tamales, etc.  Were there on Saturday, group of 8....we've raved about the yummy tamale especially.  Orders are brought to the table and WOW, the red sauce tastes like someone slipped and put in an extra 50 hot peppers.  WAY too spicy and most of the table likes their Mexican food with a little kick.  This was SO SPICY, you could not taste the food that it was covering.  Had to sip tea/water after each bite to calm the "heat".  The man in the white coat walking around asking how things were came by.  When I asked what happened to the red sauce, he said the chef wanted to spice it up a bit.....Sure hope they forget this idea and go back to the milder red sauce (which had a pretty good kick to it already).  Not sure if or when we will try it again....it was not a pleasant meal.  On a brighter note, Tony D did a great job of taking care of our out of town guests!
4	V5vHvJKjRoqFXSdvxAFjZw	Ice cream was good and places like this is hard to find. Usually places just serve plain ice cream but this ice cream was really good.   I'd recommend this to everyone although it's a bit pricey for Ice Cream.
2	KwdjQrXAxhm2UAucRIc42w	Too busy even at 11, people hogging the tables from early morning.  Mostly getting their free refills and wifi.  Saw a guy there with almost a whole office setup at a booth.  I hope those breakfast muffin sales are worth it, I'm not going here anymore.
2	H7LVuQ7Tm2zzG8Q0a370fw	When it comes to the Panda call me...ummm...Panda? (no witty comment). I make it a goal to eat at Panda Express at every chance I can muster. I enjoy their clean fresh presentation style, and open kitchen, made to order(close to) entrees. If you are new to their food, or havnt been within the last 6 months, be sure to try their new sweet fire chicken. However(there is always a flip side) this resturante wont give you the experience that Mr. Panda is known to provide. This location is dirty, the noodles are never fresh (ate here twice), and the in-store dinning is not too appealing.   ON A SIDE NOTE WHEN EATING AT PANDA ALWAYS ORDER TO GO, YOU GET MORE THAN THE STANDARD IN HOUSE DINNING PLATE
2	zLIMHrPhgmt5FS2vPaNCKA	2.5 stars.  Today Riva displayed some of the worst service I've seen a very long time.  Food and drink that took painfully long to be delivered on an afternoon where the restaurant was perhaps 75% full.  25 minutes to refill an iced tea?  Yikes.  Food was 3.75 stars with extra props to some nice grilled shrimp on my fellow diner's salad.  When you are paying 18 bucks for a sandwich or a salad, though, there ought to be something special on the plate.  Sadly, the other sandwiches were good, but not great.    Vegas prices, spotty service, decent but not spectacular food.  Wolfgang, do you really put your name on this?  Nicht so gut...
4	MvzWDe1BtM3KeFvmsCsow	Finally I found a good pho place around town.  It's not the best I've had but good.  I am a pho fanatic so I know what good pho taste like and not so good pho taste like.    I just need to ask everyone one question.  Why do people add siracha and hoison in their pho?  Everyone does it and I don't understand.  You ruin the flavor of the broth.  Just a squeeze of lime is perfect.  If you want siracha and hoison, use the little side plates for the meat.  If you want good cheap food here's a place to go.
2	RXLS0pOciX8nOONV9eoGew	Formerly The Fish Market..looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a few booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to "decent". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that, nothing to rave about.
4	5npDkUs3qCRd350MxELfbQ	Got a sub delivery. It's hard to find places around downtown Tempe that deliver when the tab is under $10. This alone made me happy.  After the food promptly came, the sub significantly exceeded my expectations :-).
2	vPuIFbu4U0pMn02vKAkew	INCA!?   SO SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD?   ...Wait, Italian?   The food is as confused as the owners. My Pizza Cardinale didn't know wither to be disgusting or burnt. But I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, because my girlfriends meal looked alot better.   The meal took forever to come and the waitress was a little short with us. The toilets were foul, bleach is cheap guys, come on!!   Gloriously underwhelming
4	B8pmNy3pUAeJWg0rEtf9dQ	If you're tired of Subway or Quizno's, then try Capriotti's.  The Bobbie definitely get's people's attention by being a Thanksgiving style sandwich but don't shy away from many of their other great sandwiches such as the Grilled Italian.  The only bad things I've noticed with this chain of restaurants is take out is the way to go since seating is very limited.  It is also highly recommended to order by phone so you don't have to stand around for 10+ minutes waiting for your sandwich.
4	21gI4DZzfwIrpI3yo2Tjw	Wonderful, regular old diner food. The coffee is always hot, and the breakfast is beautifully greasy. It's cheap and wonderful, and the servers are the usual sweet, kind of country diner servers you'd expect for a place like this.  I went there one night after an all-night insane tattoo session, and it was great. I had cheesy hash browns and hot chocolate at 4:30 in the morning. It is a happy memory.  I haven't been to San Remo in a while, but it's on my mind because I have a date coming up there tomorrow night. I'm stoked. I'm going to go fantasize about deep fried starches now.
2	ZFeM2oGZg6Eez4Vvt2Q	Food is definately not the reason to trek to this place. I found the wedding soup inedible and the prices mediocre for below average Italian. Experience was interesting and kitsch, and server was kind and replaced soup without hesitation. Just so many competent restaurants on the strip that made my experience below average.
2	7hvqxBUo009MXtcBnE4AA	Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked.  Seared Ahi Tuna:  flavorless.  Pork sliders:  Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead.
4	9YsiHGIs55Ztn72iysvpQ	Overall, this is a Great Subway with friendly service and fast food preparation (line moves quick). The locations is very convenient to UNCC and having Harris Teeter next door is a huge bonus; I'll sometime grab a sandwich before buying groceries (Never a good idea to shop hungry).  The restaurant is also clean and tidy. No complaints here!
4	ljDzKkGuN54d0nubhTWJQ	Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I had crispy, greasy, packed with meat tacos just like I like `em.  The beans and rice were great and the chips are the thinnest, most crispy delights I've had in a long time! The staff was super nice too. This place is super casual and good.
4	kxNf54gZAYu0RTxD1WQ	Beet salad with salmon was fabulous!  Salmon grilled to perfection loved the blue cheese, candied walnuts and cooked beets.  Better than  expected, especially for country club cuisine.  Noisy room a bit disconcerting; not conducive to conversation.
2	nyu0bdcv7gC90NaxDyK1uw	I came to Stripsteak with my husband.  I was extremely disappointed as was my husband.  The meal started out promising enough with the yummy duck fat fries trio and the tuna tartare poppers trio.  Then the spinach souffle came out which turned out to be more cake than vegetable.  The waitress had recommended this after my husband said that we wanted a vegetable.  Cake cooked with vegetable doesn't exactly count in my book.  I ordered a the Kobe skirt steak which was too salty and too raw on one end and overdone on the other.  The salty seasoning upset my stomach.  My husband ordered the prime rib which was decent enough but nothing really special.  We did enjoy the creme fraiche horseradish though.  As my stomach was acting up, I didn't order dessert just some mint tea to settle the tummy.  The worst thing was the foccacia bread.  It tasted doughy and wet like it was undercooked.  We sent it back telling them that and they brought out a new basket that tasted slightly better but not much.  I thought it was strange that it tasted so bad.  Not sure what was going on there.     Maybe it was an off night but the food was really disappointing.  The service was good but I think there is such a thing as checking in too often with your customers.  Eh...I don't think I'd go back unless something changes.
2	A3ZxcfyHWH4eWTGjvpte6A	If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.    They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.  The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.  The place really isn't meant for "Pizza Snobs" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, "Macaroni and Cheese Pizza" as one of the types).  There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18.
4	PVpAhQA7Y18jKpd6gCS9Q	We played golf here the day after Xmas.  We had three generations, and they let us play as a six-some!!  We teed off at about 2:30, and since it was a cold day, there was nobody behind us, so we could play with no pressure.    The fareways are in pretty good condition.  The tee boxes were a bit rough, and the greens could use some work.  But, for kids, it was great!    The funniest thing was the stray pug that we came across on the 8th hole.  He was really cute and jumped in our cart!  We had to push him out though, as we didn't need to take a dog home with us.
4	bQAtM1LIG1ApEvunf6bacg	Been eating here for 3+ yrs.  The chelow kabob is great whether you prefer Beef Koobideh, Beef Barg, or any of the chicken kabob.  The salad shirazi is also very good and the rice is something to really enjoy, specifically "tadig"!
2	xWNSji2gTw22MVosse3MXw	Another "great" restaurant inside Aliante Station.  I gave them an extra star for the perky staff. But that's it.   I tried the potato pancakes. You get a ton of them! Too bad they tasted like lemon and vinegar. I took  two bites out of a plate that was LITERALLY overflowing with pancakes. I tried telling the server that something was wrong because they tasted terrible and she insisted that the vinegar-lemon taste was the German recipe.  Now, I've never waited tables before. But it's common sense to me that if a fat lady orders a giant platter of potatoes and takes literally two small bites, she didn't like it and it should have been removed from the bill. But that's just me. Those who can't do, teach. Right?  Won't be back. Nope.
2	b67deEAgmsJ4TlBK8KSywA	I ordered lunch through Grub Hub and was given an estimated delivery time of 1 hour; according to GoogleMaps this restaurant is 10 minutes from my office. Nearly two hours later, our food finally arrived. Everything was cold; the pizza was getting tough and was slightly overcooked. Will not be ordering from there again. \", 
4	JUcwmuWql2AUg0BlGUHvxg	Best Del Taco experience to date. I like that the crew was older, and not all teenagers. This crew seemed to really care about the food, and its presentation. There were full baskets of taco sauce on each table, and the kitchen area was clean. You just cannot beat the fresh taste of their food, and the low price.
2	fHM2U4rn3fJiTaEk8M5ztw	I'm updating my review!  How times have changed...   I feel skimped for the past three visits & I won't be coming back.  It's kind of a running joke on how stingey Chipotle is on giving out meat.  But seriously... if I'm paying for double meat, please load me up.  It's seriously all I get.  I don't get rice... I don't get beans... I don't even want a tortilla... I want veggies & MEAT.  I've given up on ordering guacamole also because it's been this sad little dollop of avocado paste.  What happened to the glorious days of fair portions??  I used to love this Chipotle... but the workers seem so out of touch with their customers.  Please get it together so I can give you my money.
2	mvqlE3PnzCa2Cm4aQyOQ	If they could get some people that could understand english a bit better I think this could be a much nicer place. Some days you go in things are ok and no probelms. other times you can't get anyone to help and the cooks in the back will just stare at you like they are mad that you are making them do somthing.
4	fGs0gP46ImEnqM8HKzlbQ	I've been to very few sushi places in the valley, and most of them have been the strip-mall variety, but I always keep coming back to Sushi Yuki. It is quaint, friendly and, in my limited sushi opinion, they have pretty good sushi.   I usually get the combination rolls dinner -- California rolls, cucumber rolls and tuna rolls. I know -- not really sushi, but it is as close to sushi as I'm going to get, and it is yummy. So there.   Anyway, it's fairly small and not super busy, but probably a place for a lot of repeat customers like myself. Check it out if you are ever on the west side.
4	uGHwteOUfmdEuY2RMGo9jQ	I was in town and didn't wanna drive to the Carson strip. Found this place thanks to the girl at the front desk of our hotel. Top shelf liquer was super cheap, no cover and people were friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. Girls were receptive. Talked to everyone and they bought us shots. We did have an issue with one girl who was yelling at us, but the bouncer was cool and told them to shut up and invited us back for the next day!  It's a little local joint with big time potential. If they read this; Thanks for your hospitality and showing us Jersey Boys a good time. Oh yeah, and thanks to the girls who drove us home since the cab service in town sucks.
4	ijMup4Gn5vJiIvUjZHX8A	Murray Avenue Grill is a rare gem.  It is a local restaurant whose owner, Mark, is on site most nights.  I was impressed when Mark remembered my name the second time I visited! The clientele ranges from very young to very old.  They play 50's music, but not too loud.  The food is very good with a good range of entrees.  They have a full bar.  With your bill at the end of the meal you get two small Tootsie rolls.  How unique is that?  I love this place and will definitely visit again when visiting Pittsburgh.  I've eaten there over a dozen times and the food and service are consistently very good. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, but I've never had to wait for more than 20 minutes to be seated.  Also, there may be open seats at the bar while waiting, or you can eat at the bar.
2	i8IeuxUOmF1a22G9QZAOJw	Dear, anyone ordering delivery pizza with extra garlic sauce pods from this location...don't count on it! We have ordered from here many times because we love PJ pizza. Unfortunately, every time we ask for / pay for extra garlic sauce pods with our delivery order, the extra sauce NEVER comes!!! It is so frustrating and disappointing!! And if you call to alert them of their mistake, they say there is nothing they can do about it unless you want to come to their location to pick it up. Why do you think we ordered delivery!!?? The pizza seems to always turn out fine but if you have any extra requests for your order, you can almost count on that your pizza wishes will not come true.
2	dmnPoHHkpc9Cv0HvZ9S8Jg	I came here looking for a Chinese buffet that was decent. I left feeling pretty underwhelmed. If you like seafood then this is definitely your joint. Sadly, I won't touch the stuff so the food options were pretty limited for me. Minus big points. The food wasn't stellar but it was better than some places I've been to where it feels like things have been sitting out all day. Service wasn't rude but definitely not outgoing in any way. Can't say I'd ever have a reason so come back. Disappointing... :(
4	MfCShKt7hjW9MN6Ci3mIOQ	Being a student, I have to be cheap. But damnit, when you can splurge, it just feels nice. I also uploaded pictures of our entrees.  Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though I read it wasn't good, I ordered the Seafood Pistou because it just had a ton of seafood that sounded good (salmon, mussels, clams, tuna, something else I can't remember). You know what this dish needs. SOME CHEAP PASTA. Sounds contradictory for a pricey restaurant with high quality meats, I know, but there was so much garlic pesto in the "shallow broth" that I really wanted some pasta to help soak some of that up. It was good, though.  Boyfriend wanted to "try something new" and rather than taking a small step from meat and potatoes, he ordered the seared tuna. WTF. I ended up eating the tuna because he didn't like the texture (I thought, duh), but he liked the sesame noodles it came with. He ate them while he drooled over the filet on mashed potatoes at the table next to us. NEVER AGAIN, I told him. :)  The salmon cakes were good and I enjoyed the salad they were served on.   I enjoy coming here for lunch because the portions aren't much different for the price, but isn't that the story of lunch v. dinner, anyway?
2	7tqxfeCOP2KeVTTdAElpkA	Decent Pizza, decent price, super awesome family style service. Have not been compelled to try it again as I am feinding for some good Me-N-Ed's from Central Cali, but if I had to have pizza in Las Vegas I would order it from here.  I loved the family owned service and personal touch.  Pizza was decent but to be fair I am super picky.
2	0Hgx9mjnwVA47yy6v0fsNA	This college dive pizza-pasta place is great for what it is.  Not much on decor or ambiance but thumbs up for a quick, cheap meal.  $9 got me an iceburg salad (choice of dressing), spaghetti with meat sauce and a slice of garlic bread.  Will definitely hit the spot on a quick craving but should definitely be avoided on a "date night".  PS stick with the house Chianti ... only palatable wine in the place.
4	fM96XSh3rGZpfPNbIvFk9A	i love this place, really i've only ever had their sandwiches-but i've been back 4 times for the same thing.  pretty well authentic, with plenty of ethnic 'charm', bordering on overly frank new jersey mannerisms but whatever.  the system of ordering is endearingly awkward, the little bald chap is always willing to help...or point you to one of the 3 counters.  homemade bread, pastries, good selection of meats and antipasti, san marzano cans, and sundries.  Im definately going to hit it up for dinner one night.  extra props for being open on sundays, and being reasonably priced.
2	b4JWa9cqqNf8LXf7t1P1dQ	The worst tasting filipino food ive ever tasted in my life. Food was cold and wasnt fresh. rice smelled funny. best to say filipino food is better cooked at home. The 2 reasons why it didnt get  1 star is 1. Its on the strip and 2. only pinoy spot.on the strip.
2	HY7fTS6ob7EJyJUYfctbw	Ahhh Garfunkel's. Many years ago the Glasgow branch was a regular student haunt and whilst I've never been in this branch in Edinburgh, it did feel like a bit of a step back in time.  It had just started to rain, we weren't that fussy about where we ate and I hadn't (for a change) planned it in advance. I don't think I'd choose to go back.  It's pretty hard to write a review for a pretty bland experience with ok food and reasonable service. Everything could be better, but nothing was particularly bad with the exception of the slippery stairs which were a bit of a worry! I've definitely had better though, so 2 stars it is.  We were welcomed and seated quickly, our drinks (from a very limited selection) arrived soon after we ordered them and the food wasn't far behind that.  The pepperoni calzone I had was ok, although the dough was a bit dry and it could've done with a little more tomato sauce, the 'loaded skins' (loaded with BBQ pulled pork) were alright but I'm pretty sure they were made offsite, and Kirsty's scampi and chips seemed tasty enough.  Price wise it was a little higher than I'd want to pay for the quality I received but it is situated on the Royal Mile so there is an element of 'tourist tax' at play no doubt.  So, not a bad experience, just one I won't be in a hurry to repeat.
4	OuxQpJNXMDMyrtLFWBruQ	I work in the area and although have driven past many times I had never noticed this taco shop. Today while at work a few coworkers and I were wanting to pick up some grub for lunch so a friend suggested Don Tortacos. The best idea of the day was calling in an order which was promptly prepared for us. The services is great and their food looks and taste impressive. The items ordered were carne asada fries, hard shell carnitas tacos and a carne asada burrito.  My burrito was Amazeballs, I swear it must have had at least two pounds of carne asada meat stuffed in it. I like my meat, I can handle my meat however this seemed a bit of a challenge for the first time in my life.   This burrito was so good it made me horny. I was stimulated, I was aroused, I was wanting it over and over this day. I made love to my burrito with every flavorful bite and swallow.   I will be back for sure, as I want to try other things on their menu that look irresistible.   Food price is reasonable, friendly staff, a great salsa bar with those yummy spicy carrots and green salsa.  I will be back for sure as it has left me yearning for more! I am a dirty little whore for this place.
2	nyh4Fl9KadrI1C5gNSLykg	I have been going to Buckinghams somewhat infrequently for the past 4 or 5 years. I suspect they have changed hands at some point because the quality and portion size has drastically dropped. LIke Mona C. I had gotten the combo place once and everything on it was dry. Not just overcooked dry, but turkey jerky dry. I liked the Bruswick Stew, but I have no idea if it was good or not having never had it before. With chains like Famous Daves and Memphis around, I wanted to give the 'little guy' a chance, but they have really disappointed me. The food isn't terrible, but it's not good. If you do find yourself there, try the fried pickles, you'll feel like Elvis.
4	fp5X0PqHHRpdUJHgIkIsQg	Last night my friends and I went to this German restaurant for the first time. I had read ahead of time that the food was good, but there was a problem with the service. I completely agreed. Two of us ordered the #1 special-Stuffed cabbage roll and pork. It was very good; although next time I would ask for the gravy on the side. It was a little too much for me. The meal came with the potato soup, which was okay. The red cabbage was delicious. I also ordered a side of potato salad that I highly recommend to have them heat up. It was yummy! Finally for dessert we ordered a piece of the strudel. It was so great!  The reason for the 4 stars is because there was only one waitress for the whole place. She was very nice, but kept forgetting things. We never got the rye bread basket .  We will go back with a coupon.
4	4TqKKAbPYDuHkdLpWDnXEw	Joyful House is a great choice for authentic Chinese food minutes from the Strip.  If you don't want authentic Chinese and prefer some Americanized dishes, they do an excellent job with those too.  Try the beef tenderloin & portobello mushrooms in black pepper sauce, XO green beans, and the chicken cream corn soup.
4	XL8liJjmqmxPmW5fh6A6w	This place has a tendency to turn into a big-time hipster hangout. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but be prepared to face an unwarranted level of pretentiousness on occasion here. However, most of the time it's a fine place to sit and do some school work or meet with friends.  That said, Paradiso has probably the best coffee in the area. They serve Intelligentsia, which is an excellent call on their part. It's one of my favorite coffees and the people working seem to know how to properly make their coffee as well. With some other unnamed local coffee shops raising their prices but still turning out burnt tasting and inconsistent espresso, this should really be your first choice locally.  I've never had their food, but it has a good reputation as far as I know.
4	AoYq9zJMCMSYr6GZC5T6A	Beer selection doesn't change much if at all here. They do keep Old Meck on tap though. The food is good and if you like a good corned beef sandwich then they have a really good one here. I order one with double meat and close my eye's and try really hard to remember that feeling I had when sitting and eating at Katz Deli in NYC.
4	K5J2czC9ZisVGsfGaESTA	I like Rosa's.  Being that I've resigned myself to never again eating the great cheap Mexican food I had in Chicago (or even in Madison), I might have just lowered my standards -- but I think that Rosa's serves inexpensive and tasty food. I know some other reviewers have complained about the atmosphere, but I think the place is cute. Also, our waiters have always been really friendly. The last time I was there, we were served by a guy named Juan and he was the most outgoing, responsive and sweet waiter I've had in a really, really long time. I've only been here for lunch, so I usually have the lunch specials, which are in the $6 range. I feel like I get a pretty good deal, and the service is quick.
2	cJ3aL7YouKrbBl4A9DlQg	They no longer offer the ribeye.  Which is disappointing.  Ordered the blackened swordfish. Was way over cooked and not much taste. Ordered the garlic mash potatoes and again not much taste. Saut\u00e9d spinach was good but does not make up for the failings. I asked the waiter about the ribeye and he said they changed the menu and the chef.  Staff are nice.  Need to find another diamond in the rough near Fremont street.
4	aC3wDthbSmbVXWrzKM6Q	The best turkey sandwich ever my girlfriend says, and a great hot dog and burger also. Doesnt look all that inviting but warm inside. The locals that hang at the bar are very friendly and we actually moved to the bar and hung out after we ate. Burgers are fresh not frozen and grills the dogs. Turkey was deep fried and the sandwich was good!!
2	SWMDsUoIFLTC3tnAMSU2w	This was the first place we ate at while moving to Cave Creek. We were in our home the night before the movers were set to deliver our things - and we were hungry. We called in an order for carry out about 30 minutes before closing - we didn't anticipate It would take long for this food to be cooked. The staff on the phone did not do a good job hiding their upset. My husband headed out and during this time got lost finding the location and made it right at closing time. He picked up the food and was again treated to a bad attitude.  The food was nothing to write home about. No dipping sauces were provided/offered, things were messily thrown in the box and the taste was average. I get upset when places mentally close before they are closed.  We haven't returned in 6 months of living here and have no plans to do so.
4	NphZ53VGehREbpCkh916g	Great quick fix for sushi! Wednesday and Thursday 50% off sushi cannot be beat! Quick service and relaxed atmosphere.   I ordered two of their specialty rolls: dragon roll and Carolina Sunrise. Decent for the price but the dragon roll tasted a bit bland. The crab salad on top of the Carolina Sunrise had a bit of wasabi kick to it. I was expecting more of a volcano roll crab salad on top but this was a nice surprise.   My cousin got the lucky 7 and jack pot rolls. Lucky 7 really hit the spot! Most of their specialty rolls consisted of shrimp tempura.
2	E7NY1DuCAmXtrUJ01z3ofA	Breadsticks were dried out, house salad was pathetic but the Caesar was good. Most dishes were overpriced for what you get. My raviolis were drowned in sauce.  Service was slow and understaffed. The restaurant needs updated.
2	FoBc2qlf4GyG8Zesa5XyzQ	Not really impressed. The patio is great and they have some great beer specials. The problem is I can't get past the smell of vomit surrounding their bar area! It smells so bad. I used to always get their melted cheese dip and go out of my way to stop here for it but the smell is so overwhelming and the service is never that good. I won't return.
4	aDgzu2IeW9ELGTTDxTbwQ	I have been to this place quite a few times, more than I can count! They have some pretty nice lanes after a nice revamp a few years ago! Although they don't really compete with some of the newer ones bowling alleys in the area in the alley sense; they make up for it with their really nice atmosphere and staff. They also make up for it with their spectacular drink specials and food specials! It is bar food that is cheap and delicious! You can't beat it here.   They have some nice pool tables in the back where the bar is along with a dart board and some other fun games. They even have those bar slots and some other fun electronic bar games. The bartenders will even play bar games right there with you and are sometimes quite generous, in the sense that they don't care if they lose. They also have some great volley ball courts across the street with a bar over there as well so you are never parched. I played on their fall league once and it was a lot of fun! Everyone is really nice and is no one really takes it too seriously.  Finally, they have TV's up the wazoo so that you can watch all of the games that would be on that day and they sometimes have specials based on how good a team is doing! Props to Wildcat Lanes for keeping even me interested!
2	ckcQj7wrvct8dqFVUXWtxQ	The setup of the place draws you in and makes others jealous that you live in Coronado. More patio restaurants please! The gelato and coffee combo is a winner, but the sandwiches are too much of a good thing.  The food is of a good quality, but when the peppers and meat are layered on in a way that puts any New York deli to shame it's toooo much!  Along with the oil, etc. it makes for a very undelightful experience.  I enjoy the good stuff in manageable, less wet, proportions so I am not slapped in the face with one item, but can enjoy every part of a sandwich simultaneously.
4	4LpFhpJsxj9Ev1ufOHmOw	Experience was good. Mike was our server. Very generous and prompt. The other servers kept my table of 10 filled with salsa and chips and water. I got the Chile Reno. It was alright, which is why I docked a star. But overall the experience and environment and service was great.
2	oVljFvSdGw0lS12k2itA	So first of all, they stop taking delivery orders at 5 PM every night. FIVE PEE EM. Ridic. I begrudgingly went in to pick up my order instead and when I asked the very nice teen girl behind the counter what backwards reasoning was behind this managerial decision, she said the owner had tried to make a delivery once & he got lost for two hours in the dark. Rather than invest in GPS, which he insists is wrong in Cave Creek (I've lived here for 3 years and never had a problem with my GPS, weird) he gives up a crapload of money in business because he won't deliver at night. So I get home with this pizza and frankly it was gross. The whole purpose behind thin crust is that it's crunchy. This was a soggy mess from edge to edge. Nasty. I would have given this one star but I threw in an extra for the nice girl behind the counter.
2	LKAAxRm5DA1ckdu1DHILOw	Another Pamela's.  Type of place you love or it is just OK.  Had a group in for the Holiday's and though this would be good place to go.  I know Obama likes the pancakes which are thinner and like crepes, so I tried them.  Not my cup of tea.  But my cup of tea was good.   Also, tried a vegetable omelet, and veggies were still cool.  The Lyonnaise potatoes are good.  Place was crowded and had a line waiting for tables, then service was slow and had trouble getting the check.    Decor is art deco 1960 combination.
2	PLVE6pIPJXYVok4AHynWUw	While I understand freedom of speech, I WILL NOT SUPPORT A BUSINESS THAT CONDONES HATE SPEECH. Unfortunately we will not be coming back. I've been here a few times with my mom (she comes regularly with her friends). Tonight it happened to be trivia night so we decided to join in. All was going well until trivia halftime when the emcee went over the scores on the microphone. One of the teams chose a highly offensive, racist name to represent themselves. The emcee read it off along with all the rest.   hamburger is great, service is always good, but I was almost in tears tonight and felt sick to my stomach.   *emcee said he informed the team that their name was inappropriate, but chose to let it fly anyway. You can't control what other people say, but you, yourself, always have the choice to go along with it or stand up for what's right based on your own freedom of speech. It was clear that Fuzzy's chose to go along with it.  *My mom spoke to the manager, whose response was something along the lines of, "Well.. this group gets offended when people say this and that group gets offended when people say that..." From the manager's demeanor, my mom had to ask him if he even cared.
2	W33ui06ukb6hGAHalqfP7w	I love Chipotle. However, this particular location is not as good as the others. They gave me a smaller amount of the meat than the others do (really skimpy) and when I asked about it, did nothing to correct it. They treated me like I had the problem. I will go to the location at 67th and Beardsley or 83rd ave and Bell from here on out where they seem to have the same standards on how much of each ingredient to use.
2	NQdidsiLBIUxPEZnqc0yw	The blinds are down and you cannot even see the city aka parking lots. It is high up but the owner will not allow the blinds to be raised therefore you have to view the city between 2 inch slots.   Has such great potential!  Windows are tall, drinks are good, food is yummy. They are hiding the beautiful city skyline with the blinds.  OPEN THE BLINDS   Just check it out for yourself
4	WGNB7Z9jqAV5is4uqeuNfw	Saw a write up on a Vegas website with great review so I put it on my to do list. Apparently this place has been here for 9 years, that's a certainly a good sign.  Great service.  I had the 4 taco plate; 2 barbacoas y 2 asadas.  Asada was very good, barbacoa was also good but a little fatty, it's goat meat BTW.  They have Mexican Coke which I much prefer.  Wife had Pastor and chicken tacos.  She liked this place better than Tacos El Gordo and she's Mexican.
2	uQAUFBE7qtRYHMQHHtw	So Garduno's is now Camarones and from what I can tell the only difference is the name.   The building itself is very nice. Multiple seating areas, a cute patio bar as you enter and even an sun room (where we sat) that looks like you could open the windows and let fresh air in if desired. The menu has the standards on there fajitas, chimis, enchiladas, combination plates, etc. They even have steaks, some seafood options, and the standard hamburger (that all chain Mexican restaurants feel they need to have for our out of town company from the Midwest that is not used to the "spice"). The prices are a bit steep for what you end up getting in my opinion. The portion sizes were large, but the flavor was lacking. I shared a "fiesta platter" with my mom trying to get a feel for the food and other than the red chili pork burrito, ever thing else was bland. The chicken in the quesadilla was just boiled chicken. I would of liked some chile or onion laced within to try and amp up the flavor but no such luck. The rolled tacos were just as bland and not much different from the kind you find in your freezer selection. Was it the best choice off the menu? Probably not but I was feeling cheep and not incredibly hungry so spending 20 bucks on fajitas didn't sound appealing. I thought my meal would be redeemed by service and sophapillas- but our waiter was just OK and my drink sat empty for a while which bugs me and the sophapillas, while hot, lacked cinnamon, sugar or powder sugar, and despite my generous application of honey where still bland in comparison to other places.
4	kMQBWYoKugBQUuLY48LUA	First of all, Lao food is not exactly common around places that aren't in Laos.  And yes, it's very similar to Thai food, but there are subtle differences, and Vientiane Palace does Lao food very, very well.  At Vientiane Palace, I was famous for being the White Chick Who Ordered Thai Spicy Food.  This is, apparently, a rarity in brat-and-beer-eating Madison, and the whole staff at this place got really psyched when I came in.  I never had a problem with the service here; everyone was always extremely nice and accommodating when I brought large parties in (which I did now and then).    But the bottom line is this:  excellent food, and lots of it, for an excellent price.  One of the places I miss most in Madison.
2	EigqxNZz4zH0O6Z2H9Zmew	So when I checked in here, there was a wait at the drive thru and I was looking over reviews and I couldn't imagine a McDonald's being THAT bad. Well.. It was. No pickles on my burger, my drink had no ice and wasn't full, and the fries were lukewarm at best. Next time I'll be headed to the location on buffalo and flamingo.
2	PGAIBsky6a26hgHZfjhQw	I've tried to eat here three times, and only managed to actually get a meal delivered once.  The other two times, I walked in, sat at the counter and couldn't make eye-contact with a server.  They appeared to be too busy to get around to taking my order.  After a 10 minute wait, I left.
4	kJpoQkVJ2yUpePr6dmtGA	After finding it on Yelp and reading the reviews I decided to try it.  Its a small, local place located on the West side of the Fry's shopping center.  Its around on the side that faces 35th so its a bit remote to find.   I had to make an effort to locate it but glad I did.  Lots of local customers, many appear Italian and it is a simple place that is very comfortable.  I really liked the crust, slightly thin, crispy on the bottom a bit soft on the top.  I had two slices of Pepperoni and a 20oz soda, total with tax under $5.  Some excessive oil, probably from the pepperoni so I think next time I'll try something different like veggies, perhaps mushrooms or olives
4	x8zqLoIcTghUfpkGVIZDwA	I've been to this location a few times.  They make good Sandwiches.  I get my usual 12" BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Bread w/Chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-scottsdale-5?select=QAI_ng-kiM42p3cZc00P_Q#QAI_ng-kiM42p3cZc00P_Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/subway-scottsdale-5?select=iD67zwfhUijW1RZl4yFQVA#iD67zwfhUijW1RZl4yFQVA  The employees here are friendly and there's plenty of seating in the restaurant.  It's in my neighborhood, so I'll definitely be back.  Return Factor - 80%
4	aDYXpLXzMCMusveOWAg	Stumbled upon "Taco Tuesday" - buy any drink (alco or non) and get 2 tacos for ~$7.  Our party all partook the special offer and were all pleased with the results.  We had an array of taco flavors, my personal fav was the tenderloin (beef), while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  The chips and salsa they serve pre-meal were fantastic, really great flavor in the salsa.  Great place
4	9xCtDGja6saSmglq5d1gg	I just flew in from out of town that afternoon...and after a lazy evening of napping, talking, and kind of getting pretty, we finally made it out to grub before we hit the strip.  I have a pretty much constant craving for asian noodle soup, so we decided to go to Chinatown, since my Vegas resident friend said that it was the ONLY place to get asian food.    We randomly drove down the street and saw this place..."Cafe NOODLE...blah blah blah."  That was the place for me!  It was around midnight, and we were dressed up in very small pieces of clothing, but the waiters still made us feel comfortable.  He pointed us to the Beef Brisket & Egg Noodle Soup, so that's what we got (me without wontons and my friend with wontons).    We weren't expecting much...after all....we just found any place with noodle soup and got whatever was suggested. But MAN...it was GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!! The broth....beefy goodness without feeling overwhelmed by the beefiness.  The noodles were JUST the right texture  to complement the beefy broth.  And there were HUGE chunks of beef, the kinf that breaks apart easily and it attached to a huge piece of tendon/fat.  I know it's bad, but i've always specifically loved those fatty/tendony pieces of meat.  I got like....10 huge pieces in that little bowl!!!   It was...to die for.  So good, that we both ate the whole thing, were so full that we wanted to sleep, and we decided to go home instead of go clubbing. hahaha.  Any food that can do that to a couple of club girls MUST be amazing.    Next time I'm in Vegas i'm going to make her take me again ;)
4	ReNWsHvJB8orSo3PBS1YJw	We visited for lunch the other day and we were quite satisfied. Our server was super friendly and prompt. My husband and I are what I like to call fake-sushi fans, so we got a California Roll and a Spicy California Roll cuz we were feeling craaaazy that day. We also ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time, although the shrimp came out a couple minutes AFTER our sushi, and I would have preferred it before.  The sushi was well prepared and very tasty. The rolls stuck together just right and had good flavors. The sauce on the spicy rolls had just the right amount of heat. I know, there's not much to a California roll, but what can I say? We're sushi wimps. The coconut shrimp was nearly on par with Red Lobster's coconut shrimp (which are the best coconut shrimp out there) but a teensy bit dry. This was remedied by the yummy, spicy sauce on the side (strangely reminiscent of the sweet chili sauce McDonald's had out during the Olympics...)  All in all the service was great and we enjoyed our food, so we'll be back. The lunch hibachi prices are very reasonable so we hope to try that next time.
4	qux8m1aNieq2LsIdjlgEA	Staff was fantastic.  It was our first time in and they were incredibly friendly with a smart alec like attitude (in a funny way) and we loved it!  First timers get a free cookie!  The place was spotless... very very clean.  Loved that.  Now for the food... Hubby had a Hickory smoked turkey sandwich - cold sandwich... it was really good.  yummy chewy bread - very soft and fresh.  And mind you it was about 8pm at night.  I got a California Turkey Club - this is toasted...  I didnt know that when I ordered it but my bad for not paying attention to the menu board.  It was still very good but I liked the cold sandwich better... its all just a personal preference... hot or cold... they were both very tasty and all ingredients were fresh and delicious.  I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to eat here but it was a good sub.
2	s8Xn3NRAysWF4IVUZ9WA	Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.
2	gISuHDCUJ4GAuiFJT3ZQ	I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.
2	1Voi9uOgdggbvFye49Rw	Yikes! I had high hopes for this place, and I was disappointed.  The customer service was awesome, which is what the 2 stars are for.  The food was not good.  Less quality then Subway.  I got a vegetarian sub on wheat.  The bread is horrible.  no strong and thin almost.  The veggies were ok.  My mayo was kinda warm? blahhhh! Not very good at all, I will not go back.
4	oHBooZgCz2hYo4H8wcJ2Gg	Pssst.  Don't let the other reviewers trick you into thinking that this place is famous for it's deep-dish pizza.  It's not.  (Well, maybe it is).  But there are few things I look forward to more than a nice slice of thin crust Oreganos.    You can't miss their billboards or t-shirts around town.  If you're within 5 miles of Tempe, and you haven't checked this place out, go now.    No.  Seriously.  Go.  And if it's not too hot, sit outside.  The ambiance can't be beat.
2	f5E7zI84TDGPLc0xPFgULQ	Ugh....  I went in humming "I want my babyback, babyback, babyback" and left wanting to give the babyback, babyback babyback.  I'd never had the ribs before and since I had a 3 hour layover and a 4 hour flight I thought it was a good time to try a larger meal. Turns out it was a large meal of nothing.   The "steak" fries were the best part and they were just tolerable. Cut like McDonald's fries, I was left wondering what made them "steak" fries... a little seasoning? A least they were cooked correctly. Not the crunchy outside, vacuuous inside alien food you get at a lot of places.  The corn on the cob was actually gross. It had been cooked so long ago all the starch had turned to sugar. It tasted like cream of corn... too sweet, artificial sweet. It was also so water logged that water literally poured with each bite. It should be served in the middle of a kiddie pool with a headrest so you don't drown when you fall asleep from boredom. I couldn't take more than a few bites.   The Bar-B-Que sauce was extremely vinegary... pucker vinegary... and I like vinegar! It left little room for any flavor.   Unfortunately, it appears the sauce and the ribs had only just met as the ribs had no flavor... none. This provided for some sharp flavor contrasts that were none too appealing. The meat wasn't quite tough.. but not falling apart either.... and they were well done. So well done that the fat and any natural flavor had left them long ago.   The service and management were very good. Seating was crowded for a normal restaurant and unbearable in a restaurant where everyone has luggage.... the physical kind... not the mental kind. That's another story.   If you're traveling through Charlotte my advice is to let your mom pack your meals in your carry on like she wants to and mortgage the house so you can buy a soda or two once past security.
2	etUgMkh0Ch3oEMQiGQapEQ	Tried to be healthy and get a bite to eat here instead of the junk food restaurants at the airport.  Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.  Instead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.  Will I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.
2	m86tVLWkyawvoDfAolzqkA	This place is OK.  The food was prepared very, very well.  But the dishes were really boring.  The scallops were served with a wear array of accompanying sauces; the desserts were uninspired; and the appetizers were unremarkable.  The food is actually 3 stars, but considering the price, it's gotta be 2 stars.
2	ulzbKo8AoAuQ2ozUiDDFw	I've been to many TGI Friday's as a single, a couple and a parent with kids. I have to say the staff did not seem to have a clue as to how to deal with parents with kids. The hostess was more concerned about where we were going to 'park' our stroller then in finding us a seat in a nearly empty restaurant that met our needs. This Friday's, being in a Vegas locals casino, is used to kids so it is not like this was a new experience.   That aside, the menu was good as far as selection but only so-so in preparation. We went to this one because we knew it was early enough and so the restaurant would be empty. I can't say I would go back.
2	XHHoUr0lNrW0jGenLTDBg	Although the zyggyz rolls are still tasty, and they have added non-crinkle cut fries to the menu, I have to update my previous review. I've now tried the indian platters, and they are not great. The chicken is tough, the curries are a bit too sweet... If you're craving indian food, this probably will not cut it unless you've had a beer too many. Also (and this is what really did it in for me), I paid an extra $2 for 'naan', and got a piece of pita bread. Unacceptable.
2	rPUR9Y0WRNo8Y5xEfUCMfg	This place is just OK.  If it wasn't for the really awesome salsa then I'd say it totally sucked.  The guacamole was not good...too tangy or something.  The bean dip seemed like it was a can of refried beans poured into a bowl.  I'd probably go back to have some more of that yummy salsa and to try something different to see if it could redeem them...but I'm not counting on it.
4	VkewpnFfuTWjfJZqqCtSw	Very delicious seafood salad and (usually) tasty raspberry stuffed chicken (get it as a lunch special, otherwise a bit overpriced, and can be a bit dry.)   The hummus is middling/inconsistent and I'm not sure how I feel about the ubiquitous cucumber curry salad dressing, but I go there pretty frequently because it's a good place to have wine with your lunch and I am all about being as French as possible.
2	txbdTTfOMpt61KTGnqg	I've been a fan of the Wild Wings in South Charlotte for some time now, but our recent visit to the EpiCenter location has changed my opinion.  Granted, it was late and the food quality was still good, but I could not believe how terrible the service was.  The wait for service was so long we nearly left twice.  A disappointment for sure, but hopefully an anomaly.
2	3VAiYwo9PU57UfaBpBYwg	We decided to get some take-out after spending too much money at Target. We hit up Aranya since it was in the same area and got the chicken pad thai and chicken with cashew nuts. The chicken and cashew nuts were really bland and tasteless. The pad thai was pretty good, although I'm no expert at Thai food. Would I go there again? Maybe, if I need a quick fix of  Thai food that's close to home. But, if I was really craving good Thai, I would have to go elsewhere.
4	xZzrPE9vuquBd9wVsBj1uw	Are you sure this is a chain?  The staff is awesome the food is great. The prices are reasonable.   Sounds like a mom n pop type place to me.   I still am a fan of the Pollo Fundito... wife tried the shredded beef one and it was good but not as good as the chicken.
4	2rMlWsWU4ZdC5MluvpvcfQ	Tasty Cobb Salad  My wife and I visit Babes about once every 6 weeks for a Cobb salad.  Can't really speak for the rest of the menu; however, if you like Cobb salads (and you should, they're good for you), then you'll like Babes.  These salads are comparable to the Boston salad at Bostons Gourmet Pizza in Greenway Station in Middleton, better than the Cobb salad at TGI Fridays in Greenway, but not as good as Benvenuto's in Fitchburg.  Service, atmosphere, and price are all reasonable.  In the summer there's a nice place to sit outside although the view isn't much.  Alas, Bostons in Greenway Station went belly up in the summer of 2010.
2	g6RToaqt2k1c1QjYUYLcwg	In general, I like Einstein Bros Bagels. Not the best food in the world, certainly not the worst. This location has been a quick breakfast stop for the wife and I since we moved to this part of town. I haven't had any problems with the quality of food at this location, but literally every time I go into this store, the same people are working, and they are always grumpy. It doesn't matter if its busy or slow, they are grumpy and running around like they have their heads cut off.  Like I said, I've not had a problem with the food, but the service isn't up to snuff because of the attitudes of the staff. I can't say I won't come back, because I know I will, some days start better with a Spicy Elmo and a cup of their Fair Trade coffee...but if I can find another quick breakfast spot in the area, I will be a happy man.
4	gsCxHEyGeNfaxmlyrIrEA	Love this place for Chinese! We've ordered from them a few times and the general tso is excellent... not a big fan of the wonton soup - tasted off, somewhat greasy and the wontons in hot oil - I have no clue what that was but it certainly wasn't edible.
2	Vff6IHQXTuZ2eq20ML1svA	Where do i even start with this place?  OK there was one waiter running the whole restaurant so the service was lacking off the bat. I asked for a beer and he gave me the warmest beer i have ever received at a bar or restaurant and i told him i didnt want it and he insisted it was fine.   The food was pretty awful aside from the garlic bread. I got the veal and it was so rubbery with no flavor at all. The rest of my friends received small portions of flavorless food. We were on vacation and we wanted to try something nice but we were disappointed.  Additionally we left a nice tip even though the service was a 1/5 and the waiter had the audacity to complain about the tip which was close to 30%.   Definately stay away there is better options
4	dsKtRH64g5a7obGvAee0A	Came all they way from downtown Phoenix cause I was craving a banana shake but the machine was broke down, which put a damper on my night but the fries and hamburger made up a little! Can't wait for the rally's to open in my phoenix so the drive isn't as long. Don't get me wrong it was worth it.
2	kAOUcWWXIJ4VmnNSsDITjA	I don't know how you can make a Subway sub bad, but these guys do a pretty good effort it. It's not horrible - it's still a Subway sub - it's just not quite right...  I'm still going to go there, because I'm lazy, I live in Verdun, it's slightly more healthy than a burger and a poutine, and cheaper than going somewhere awesome like Blackstrap.
2	VZCLnQ4O1wBzgDiIc4Cg	Went twice to this restaurant. During the first time we were given French menus and had to wait for another table for them to order and take their menus and they were taking long. Also, there was no pizza which is one of the signature dishes. The service was very slow.  The second experience was even worse. The service was slow and bad. We were the first to be in the restaurant and were the last to get our food. The food came cold. The ambiance was weird, from well-known symphonies to radio station music and shows. It sounded like we were in the gas station across the street. There are some good dishes but it wasn't worth the bad service and weird ambiance.  Finally, this restaurant is defiantly overpriced.
4	XH2a79CtYonGv6fiEgnkA	I used to order subs during 14 hr shifts, to have half for lunch & half for dinner...It's been more than a year since I've had one, and I still crave them!  Ordering was easy and delivery was always much faster than expected.
2	mKQ7zsrqL7JGdXgf9t4A	Just got back from dinner at Sushi 101.  Not sure I'll be going back.  We arrived around 5:30 and there were only at most 6 customers in the restaurant.  We were promptly greeted by the very friendly hostess. So far so good.  Then out comes our server.  She was more interested in brooding hanging out behind the curtain than taking anyone's order. When she finally did get around to taking our order  it was "what do you want.... ugh... fine...."  We ordered various sushi rolls(California roll, philly rolls, spicy tuna, crab roll, and some other roll) and a plate of fried rice and a side of spicy mayo. Well the sushi came out after a few min.(super fast Sushi chefs) but the server pretty much just dropped it on our table and ran away Ignoring the fact that we had 2 empty drinks and  NO SPICY MAYO. We tried for about 10-15 to track her down to but she was no where to be found. We looked around and realized we weren't the only unhappy table.  Seemed the only people who worked there we could find were the sushi chefs and felt it a little disrespectful to ask them for spicy mayo and refills.  Needless to say the service stunk, after reading the other reviews It looks like this may be a common theme for sushi 101.
4	ZyTN56KKwJulKEuCI9GR4w	My husband and I come here all the time and we love it!!!! The bar staff is great and the food is sooooo good I would give it 5 stars but sometimes gets to smoky when it gets busy and we really don't like that but other than that it's a great place where everyone knows you and feels great to feel welcomed!!!
4	cjZSTIReVVkvaw29i2gAbQ	I am over on this side of town today. I was decently hungry for dinner and decided to stop in the Panda Express . Very clean and the crew is very friendly. Many different entr\u00e9es are on display for you to choose from. Good price point if you went with 1, 2, or 3 entree size plate. It comes with at least one side which will be rice or chow mein noodles. Calorie count is posted as well to help you make a good choice if you are watching that. I went with the two entree size plate. More than enough for one. I had them take off half the side of chow mein noodles. I'm glad I did. Still good sized portions! I ordered the mushroom chicken and honey walnut shrimp. There was an up charge of $1.25 for the shrimp, which the server will ask you if you're okay with it before adding it to your plate. I also got a side of crispy cheese won tons with sauce on side. I drank water and spent about $10. Decent for Chinese fast food.
4	kJJWhOMF2dkdsbkP2TwBg	After my first visit I wasn't sure I would be back.  However, we were in the area and decided to give it another shot.  We were in the mood for a good burger so what the heck.  Back in August when we went the place was dead.  There were only like 10 other people in the entire place.  This time however the place was jam packed...both inside and out.  I'm guessing its the snowbirds but I don't know.  We went on a Wednesday and I guess that is the day when they have live music on the patio for a few hours.  They also have some decent drink and appetizer specials if you are interested.  The weather was excellent and the band sounded good so our party of 5 took a table outside.  We shared some chips and salsa, got a few burgers and salads, and listened to the band.  It looks like the same band is there every Wednesday for the rest of the season.  They are an excellent cover band and play some good stuff.  The first time we went here the service was a bit slow.  I thought for sure it would be horrible this time because there were tons more people, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  They had ample wait staff and everything was pretty quick.  I will definitely come again preferably on a Wednesday.
2	9aYMKRWn7CCKWZzFLySPQ	The food is great, but DON'T rush from the drive through without checking your bag for all of your ordered items.  And also check your receipt for that matter.  I ordered one meal, one sandwich, and one small fries.  Did not get our fries and the receipt says we were charged extra for the drink that came with the meal (that was given to us WITHOUT a straw).  So frustrating!!!!
4	umHFjmqbnpKjl4heUQ6PKQ	A pretty average pub with a wonderful outdoor seating area. There are some pretty powerful heaters for when it is colder and it is a nice place to enjoy a beer on a summer night.  I've only had the food once. I was with a larger group and everyone was happy with the food, they were all also a little drunk at the time. I was all about my food, I can't remember what it was called but it was a burger and brat patty sandwich.  They also have to go food options if you are on the move.
2	xwsPVLTLaAmy957NyaVeQ	With such a small selection and steep prices, I was expecting something local, organic and sustainable. The decor and style of the place definitely looks the part, down to french pressed coffee and tea served at the table. But no, they just look like it. It's a bit of a drive and isn't near anything I frequent and while I liked the decor and style, the food won't have me coming back.  I ordered fish and chips, tempura style... All I could taste was flour and mush. The fish was soggy and completely without flavor. The chips were actual potato crisps (I was expecting fries, so it was a little disappointing) The best part of the meal was the veggie slaw. The ice cream and dessert did sound amazing (but then so did the fish and chips;) ). I tried a few spoonfuls of different flavored ice creams and they were quite good. So maybe it's more of a dessert kinda place?   Also this is an older crowd (probably because of prices), most patrons were well over 40. I felt like a kindergardener,
4	ONHMvRGIxgsQNxvmbcl37A	This may not be the fanciest place in Pittsburgh but it provides a great, quick lunch which is what I often need when I am downtown. I had the Greek Salad. The dressing was amazing, you can tell that it was homemade. It was very large and filled me up. I enjoyed Apollo a lot and plan on returning.
4	u6sNEOA7ryGOyvLnNleNHQ	We had a blast at the It-Am Supper Club! When I was there, we paid $10 cover to eat at a table inside the stage room/dance hall area, where a retro cover band was performing merrily. The singer was joined by several other singers including a guy who used to tour with the Del Vikings; Jackie Wilson's son; and some other eccentric and aging Vegas showmen. The vibe of the place was total mafioso, including our casually flustered server and the young men sitting at the bar who greeted us as if they owned the place, which maybe they do.   We didn't come for the food, but it was quite acceptable basic Italian-American fare.  Go for the gawking and the music!
4	O1RBGcXzldz0IiVjsFjY1A	I really like the changes and new location within the shopping center. Seriously delicious pizzas and good service. Much smaller space than the original, but I like that it's not so "sports bar" oriented. A few booths, some bar seating, and a more modern interior. When we went, it had only been open a few days, so they were working out some kinks. I hope that the patrons of the previous location flock back in.   Back when I was eating meat, I remember loving the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza. So good. The salads are also top notch. I saw a couple of local beers on draught...always something I appreciate.  All in all, for good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere, this place wins. I hope they do well in the new space!
2	cbmGzQxzh0OpV5Iqde4Rg	I think my family from Brooklyn would be offended with the vain use of their borough's name for sub standard pizza.  I went here for a late lunch with a coworker looking to try something new. When we walked in at 1pm it was dead, they seemed excited to have us as customers and were happy to show us how their lunch specials worked.  I opted for a single slice of cheese pizza, my usual test case for a pizza place.  My coworker went for the lunch special that included a small side salad and a fountain drink.   My pizza was not fresh, and a bit too soggy and floppy, I made liberal use of the red peeper, Parmesan and black pepper to cover up what the pizza lacked in flavor.  There was a popcorn machine in the back with free popcorn, however it seemed empty and infrequently visited.  They do have many special on beer, and i think the only time this place is busy is before and after a basketball game at the adjacent arena.
2	iw5jFHgmNw75JqtB6QqfLA	Overpriced. Really overpriced. I had a burger and it was an ok burger. I really liked that hot sauce they have there. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Service was very marginal. Long time on refills and they don't have ranch for your fries so don't ask. Go elsewhere and pay half as much for better food. Did I mention it's expensive?
2	gUssAwT6xR3qPg2jMt6d5A	Moe's is very average food. There isn't anything that stands out and falls behind similar places-Qdoba, Chipotle etc.   The food was fresh and tasted alright, but was nothing special. The burritos are on the smaller end and has smaller portions inside the burrito.  My biggest problem was the value. There is NO way a burrito of that size with that little rice, beans, meat should cost over $7.50 for an original size. I've had bigger and better burritos that cost around $5. A small soda for $2.50 is also a bit much (free refills).  With each order you do get chips and salsa. I really liked the chips. Salsa was okay.  One other thing that baffled me. My wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. You get this in a white box. When you try to throw it away, you can't fit the box in the trash can as the top is configured in a weird way. Good thinking.....  I was amused by the name of the Burritos-Homewrecker, Art Vandelay etc. Good stuff!  Moe's won't be high on list to go back to around Jobing.com for me. There are other places that are better.  2.5

2	GoCk7lmbqeQNiKFOCCcO0A	THE GOOD:  Tortillas...soft, light, oozing with freshness...its all about the tortillas at Carolina's...and looking straight over the food counter into the kitchen where the cooks are lovingly tossing and stretching each piece of dough by hand  THE AVERAGE:  Bland decor and cafeteria style furniture  that they seem to have inherited from previous incarnation of this location  THE UGLY:   The fillings here have flavors so subtle (bland) that I couldn't taste much...looking around at the packed dining room, I thought may be I ordered the wrong thing...so I kept ordering...by the end of the meal I ate my way through the green corn tamale, the foot-long burro with house made chorizo, the machaca burro, the soft taco machaca and the green chile burro...I'm sad to report that  I couldn't find any tasty filling in all that  I wanted to like this place, but in the end, can't find a reason to come back.
2	JQzw28dtRYgNv72kjqU37w	Good food, poor business practices!  Be AWARE when using coupons, even theirs, and ordering a "meal" they do not give you the "meal" pricing.  This devalues the coupon.  The fact they are not upfront about this is deceptive.  My Quiznos calendar is in the trash!
4	xSgUAuYr8scNchWDEcJmjQ	Plaid is a fun little cafe style rerstaurant near the ASU Tempe campus.  Their prices are reasonable, about $6-10 for a meal.  A couple of good beers on tap.  Great vegetarian options.  Yummy healthy food. Great desserts.  Drawbacks:  They almost never have the deserts listed on their menu.   If you are unlucky enough to patronize Plaid on a night which they have a guest band playing, your hearing will surely be damaged.  Plaid is a small place and if a non accoustic band is playing, you wont be able to hear the person across your table.  If you are going on a thursday-saturday night, I recommend calling ahead to see if a band is playing.
4	cng5ONz6RE7ixx3O2Rti5Q	Oh Skinny Dugan's.  Back in the day it was my underage drinking establishment of choice.  It's still not a bad place to go if you're in the neighborhood to grab a drink or even some food.  (As far as bar food goes, Skinny's pretty much can't be beat.)  The clientele ranges from the older, video poker playin' crowd to corporate sports teams having after-game drinks to families from down the street just trying to get some grub.  The bartenders, owners and waitresses are very friendly and attentive as well.  Not a lot of character, but lots of heart.
4	l0VCHz6fuXQxXBdhvFLXA	Honestly my favorite place I've visited so far. The blended drinks are awesome. Call me silly, but I prefer those to the pure liquid drinks. I'm sort of slushy drink person. Music was good. A little empty but I was there a little late. I'd definitely go again.
4	TDaV8BXvfG5S8y7POODw	Best Cajun burger maybe ever.  Solid mushroom Swiss burger and fish fry.  Plenty of TVs to watch sports.  About 12 quality beers on tap and a decent selection of scotch. Pool table and booths up top. great local bar.
2	jviec17dFs7OpEX2sQ	The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!  That said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.
2	57btAlOJ5h4PibmnUSC6g	Let it be known that not all Subway stores are created equal!  I was sorely disappointed when I stopped in here for lunch last week (Tuesday Evening) for some dinner.  I had my usual Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Wheat with: lettuce, tomato, onion, green bell pepper, cucumbers and sweet onion sauce.  $5 DOLLAR FOOT LONG!  We were the only ones in the store and it took forever for us to get through our order.  It seems like one of the employees were new on the job.  The final straw for me giving two stars was that this location had NO LIGHT LEMONADE!  I'm wish this place would include the lemonade... I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and try this location again - although I'm almost tempted to just drive 2 miles down the road to the one on S. Fort Apache and Sunset.    I think definitely one of the people behind the sandwich counter was new.
4	kikLDjQNmao7yO7lwqWQ	Loved this place!  Great ambience, nice and relaxed with a hint of sophistication.  Hubby loved the extensive beer list.  I had a steak which was cooked perfectly and had a magical rub on it that ranked in my top 3 steaks of all time.  They also have a very eclectic menu, so there's something for everyone here. Would go back in a heartbeat!
2	QuK2MsXzbszq2T0co2E6vw	This Pick Up Stix is one of the worst for quality.  I can order the same dish and, somehow, over the span of a week, it can be completely different.  Sometimes the food will have onions, sometimes it won't.  Some days the chicken will look fried, some days it will look defrosted.  Whatever, you get what you pay for, but this is my least favorite of a usually reliable chain.
2	2zL3UUCu4EQeLizz0Ju5tA	Je peux difficilement donner une meilleure \u00e9valuation. Ayant visit\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises ce restaurant pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des midis 2 pour 22 $. (Une bonne aubaine des repas complets de ribs \u00e0 11 $ par personne.) Malheureusement, \u00e0 chaque visite le service fut tr\u00e8s lent pour des midis en semaine. Il y a peu de choses aussi frustrantes que de saliver pendent une longue p\u00e9riode de temps, pour se faire servir ses ribs ti\u00e8des tirant sur temp\u00e9rature pi\u00e8ce.   S'il pouvait servir \u00e0 une temp\u00e9rature convenable et donner l'addition en une heure, je donnerais quatre \u00e9toiles. La nourriture est toute de m\u00eame succulente. (\u00c0 noter, nous \u00e9tions un groupe de quatre \u00e0 chaque visite.)
4	MbRDNiKEePFUS2ANmq7g	Don't go on a Friday during lent... Our bad. For the challenges the staff faced that night our server was great and the menu items were of good quality and value. We will visit again and maybe upgrade my review.
4	85hfUlHnSgoQriY97ZeJg	I like the food here - it's a fast chinese lunch place so, don't expect the best Chinese food.  That said, it is good, prices are very reasonable, and I have had good experience with the seafood dishes - generous with shrimp.  The servings are very large - two lunches even for a big appetite.  Crab Rangoons are a particularly nice treat.
4	Y3JaBcAuVJEgpvm7evUrBg	I'm a long time fan of Sonic. Just the drink possibilities are awesome. I recommend a Watermelon Limeade (that's a limeade with watermelon flavoring) or a chocolate coke.   U can never go wrong with tots (with or without chili/cheese/onions) - they are way better than any french fry ever concocted! The "new" hot dogs they have here are pretty tasty. I had a Chicago-style dog, and it was piping hot with a snappy casing as you bit into it. I'm not gonna abandon a true Vienna Beef dog joint for them - but it's nice to know they are almost as good! Maybe next time I stop in I'll see if they can do a foot long this way - that would be awesome, although there won't be a poppy seed bun involved, and that's a shame.   Sonic, are you listening?? You could create AND corner a market with footlong ChiDogs - but you gotta have the poppy seed buns!!  Check their add-on list - you can add a lot of things (including green chile and jalapenos) to just about anything, and that is just one more bonus that sets Sonic apart from the rest of fast-food corporate America.  One of my fave things about Sonic is that the carhops rollerskate - alas - even Sonic seems to be slacking off on this. It should be required to have ALL hops on skates. I do give them props for hiring people that can actually count change correctly! It's hard to find a waitress or cashier these days that can subtract $9.91 from $20 in their heads. Sonic is keeping mathematics alive!
2	w6e2gqmOxPAwUffamTaanw	I agree with the others that this particular chick Fil a is Slowwww! The drive thru takes a while. Food is ok but the waffle fries are not as crispy as they should be I'm kinda disappointed! They only gave me a little bit of chicken on my salad too.  I've had better in other locations.
2	QaYkElr6fCzb98W586A	The food was gringo interpretation of Mexican food. Which meant the sauce was not spicy but bland with a side of mild. I swear the rice was from Uncle Ben's it was so bad. My chicken tortilla soup was tasty. Typical suburban crowd of tired moms, bitter dads and unruly children screaming everywhere. Our waiter was efficient but odd. The chips and salsa were good but its hard to mess that up.  If we were not meeting friends here I would have chosen a better chain restaurant or better yet a local one. Hell the food from the local food carts downtown is better. Boring is the word that sums it up. Boring.
4	WuSNFYRoIiN6xf6Y0ZCKtA	So I'm having a steakhouse conversation with some friends and Sullivan's comes up...I know it's a chain, and I know there are more popular places in town, but if you have been here multile times, the overall consistency of the experience at Sullivan's stands out in my mind! I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal or service experience here. Of the upscale steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Beef and Bottle, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Palm, etc), Sullivan's may not rate as the best in each category (food, service, value, atmosphere), but I would put it 2 or 3 in each one - thus giving it the title of Charlotte's best steakhouse.
4	CFHBdjYdb5miTZLwOq6XqQ	Orient Kitchen, known as "OC" among the college students (I'm not quite sure where the C comes from), is traditionally the place where students go for large group dinner celebrations, but I've been there for just dinner as well before.  Dishes are usually ordered family style, which is everyone sharing multiple dishes; the usual suspects include salt and pepper squid, shrimp w/ mayo, chinese watercress (kong xing cai) or baby pea sprouts (do miao), and crispy fried milk.  Sometimes I've ordered their Peking Duck, but its nothing spectacular, China Palace serves up better Peking Duck.  Also their Twice Cooked Pork is also lackluster.  OC has a decent liquor selection, and their drinks are relatively cheap at under 5 dollars each.  Prices for dishes are typically in the lower to mid teens; a typical check tends to run around 20ish for those with larger appetites, drinks not included.  OC is pretty good Canto food by Pittsburgh standards, but for people who are use to better options for Cantonese style Chinese food found in more Asian-populated cities, the food may leave more to be desired.
2	YaU5rAxTjVr36CgK4lyA	I did not like their food both times I went..I had burgers both times and they were gross and soggy. Ick. Plus, the waiter took forever to bring our food and our check. I seriously spent 2 hours eating when I could have spent half that time had I had a decent server! He constantly forgot things that we asked for too and I was left without something to drink a few times. Bad service.
2	UDWZgaHyuHGBpVUQBPxrQ	Although the decor is very nice, the alcohol prices are outrageous,  We went there for opening night of football season...supposedly they were having  drink and food specials with raffles. Paid $5.50 for a well drink and little to NO alcohol...A Corona was $4.50...some food specials...but no raffle.  People in the bar were not friendly...Sorry...we won't be going back...I should have read the reviews prior to going.....back to BWW ...
4	kbwVza9E9ORnZAP1JtZBA	Full disclosure... I used to go here all of the time until they got a bad health rating. I put them on about a six month hiatus before I worked up the nerve to go there again. In that time I ate at many hole in the wall Chinese places. None of them really won me over.  So I went back to Tea Room and all I can say is wow. It's not that they have changed from before. Rather it is how much better they tasted than all of the other strip mall type Chinese spots. That hiatus gave me perspective. Are they PF Chang's? No. But when you get that craving for some cheap Chinese that is just plain solid? Tea Room won't steer you wrong. I go probably three times every month.
2	43pjlMPiZHXlEbnEcEiSoA	A few co-workers went there on a Tuesday evening.  Good beer selection at the bar but the prices are way too high.  Moved to a table to order dinner.  Again, prices are high for pub food.  They have fancy, fun names for food that just isn't that great.  I had the salmon which was okay but I've definitely had better at a much lower price.  One of my coworkers got the pulled pork BBQ crepes and she got sick later that night.  Thumbs down.
4	vpcq36f633k4C3MmU7G1g	Nestled around the back of some other buildings, this place is one of Charlotte's hidden gems.  Not fancy by any means, the food is just plain good.  Whenever we've been there it's always busy, and the staff is quick to greet you with a smile and a hearty welcome.  The dishes are not fancy, but they are well-prepared and served quickly, with plenty of food on the plate for a solid price.  The servers will help you decide what to order - just be sure you don't take too long to order.  Take their advice and run with it.
2	EI61e4WItXIVl4ayV8Rg	We've really enjoyed food I've had here - specifically the fresh peaches & cream hotcakes and the grits!  However, the small cafe charm ends there as the service has been very poor 3 of the 4 times we've been there.  We've basically stopped going as it was just too frustrating.
2	evsvnAW6f3RH4NJ5ZMZLw	This place has gotten such hype for being mediocre at best. I had the spinach pie, which was just a dressed up spanakopita. Flavors were fine, on the bland side but for $15 totally not worth it. The rest of my party seemed to be bored with their meals, just moving them around the plate as to not make our host feel bad for choosing the location.
2	GycC6YaUM81O9pkG3vXBlQ	The only thing I really remember about this restaurant is how much I paid and how hungry I was when I left! There are two things that I enjoyed about this restaurant...hence the two stars. 1. The tuna pizza with truffle oil YUM!  and 2. The view of the Bellagio water show from the restaurant.
4	3ap381KzfrWgR9Z4oUQzAA	Two words: greasy goodness.  I suppose I should write more, since there is more to say about this little gem called Burger Shoppe.  The Shoppe is in what some would call a sketchy part of town, but that shouldn't stop you from coming by for some good food.  They have an extensive menu that includes great burgers, hot sandwiches and some Mexican dishes thrown in for good measure. I've had their cheeseburger many times and have never been disappointed. And, I've also had their gyro, which is very, very yummy.  And, their fries are fantastic too.  Crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. (Ironically, that is also how I describe myself).  Another great lunch spot if you work near the Capitol. It can get pretty busy around lunch time, and parking can be a bit horrendous, but it is all worth it in the end.
4	dNuUCK9Kxlihfdt0o2PWw	i was skeptical at first to try sushi in las vegas because it is in a middle of a desert. i was pleasantly surprised because it is really good and fresh. they have 20+ rolls to choose from, and the prices are very reasonable ($5 to $12 per roll). nigiri sushi about $1.95 a piece. AND they "super white tuna" (not albacore)..which is my favorite sushi fish.   the place is small, and quaint...a friendly neighborhood joint...seats 20-ish people. i will definitely try again while i'm here!  edit: if you're hungry, definitely go for the $21.95 all-you-can-eat. most of the sushi, rolls, and appetizers are on the menu. everything is made to order too!
2	W8DiWnZWLXDSnGT3rlCSOA	It hurts, physically hurts, to give Mikado just two stars, when on my last visit to Montreal I gave their sister restaurant, usually not nearly as good, many more, but tonight was atrocious.   We made the trip to Mikado from Cote St. Luc because we knew that every time we've gone, the food has been superb. Ok, small issues with customer service (when they tried to convince me "usuzukuri" was a type of fish and not the preparation of it), but the food made up for it.   We arrived around 6:30, and ordered about 10 minutes later. My father's entree arrived in about 15 minutes, a decent Chicken Katsu. My mother and my appetizers arrived a few minutes later. The first was Hamachi Sashimi that was so fishy-smelling and slimy, after one piece each we returned them to the waiter. He made no comment about it, not even the basic apology we usually expect when one returns inedible food.  The green salad was nice, the salmon tartare decent but nothing to write home about.   About 50 minutes later, we received one more dish, the salmon/tuna tempura, my ABSOLUTE favourite Mikado roll, and were told our Jazz roll was "coming." This roll is lightly seared and then tempura fried - but when it got to us it was so cold it felt like it had just come out of the fridge, and the tempura was chewy. Again, we returned it unfinished, and this time he tried to convince us that the roll was fine and that we'd just misunderstood the way it was made.   Then we sat back to wait.   And wait.  At 8:25, almost two full hours after arriving, and more than an hour and a half after ordering, we canceled the Jazz roll and asked for the bill.   The only reason they got the second star in this review is because without us having to request it, they took the Sashimi, the Jazz Roll and the Salmon/Tuna tempura roll OFF the bill. We still paid $60+ tip for a meal that left most of us hungry, and heading home for a bagel to fill up, though.
4	Hws1OqgrybjyJUS5i9sIEw	Barro's is a pretty good option to consider when you're too lazy to make something, as long as it's close to you. It's quick, relatively cheap and tastes good. We go with a large pizza, a small antipasto salad (love this!) and garlic bread...all for under $20. Lasts us a few meals and hits the spot. No complaints here!
4	XkOGgTboIhdMCap8RUIVA	Killer authentic Mexican food.  Just a diner atmosphere off of a Mexican courtyard (in the same place as another killer Mexican seafood resturant - San Diego Bay).  When I worked down in that area, used to drop in once or twice a week.  Went back a couple of weeks ago, and still as good as ever.
4	mDTtqiyGA2e3y85mgAuNKw	Can you say Old School or dive steakhouse?  This is it.  The food is good as well as the frosty beverages.  The bar is ultra small and very much like a dive bar but beyond the astetics the food is wonderful.  Some items like the ribs are priced in line with what you would expect of a steakhouse but some things are expensive.  The soup is rad and big portions of fries.
4	ZvGODYE1Q6LD8Ho7EVqLQ	Small quaint little pub. The service is quick and the people are nice . Not the best sports bar as the TVs are small and the sound off . But nice place to kick it in north Vegas. The Beer is really cold and the food is good . Happy hour between 5-7 with pizzas half off.
4	uHXDmjGIcy59HU6ZKZPkA	Chaya is an extremely impressive Japanese restaurant: the food is great, the sushi is leagues better than anything else in Pittsburgh that I've found, and because it's actually run by Japanese people who make pretty authentic stuff.  The menu is a little intimidating, especially if you're not tremendously versed in Japanese cuisine, because it's surprisingly long, and I just didn't know what the hell to order. In the end, I ordered a Deluxe Sushi & Sashimi Combination Dinner, and my girlfriend ordered two rolls and a tempura appetizer.   All the dinners come with a salad, miso soup, and some pieces of kaarage (fried boneless chicken). The salad is pretty average. The miso soup is quite good, but nothing to write home about. The kaarage, on the other hand, prompted me to write this review. These three pieces of juicy, tender, crispy chicken morsels were simply the best fried food of any sort I've had in the last year. I'd highly recommend that everyone opt for a 'dinner' rather than 'a la carte;' the $3 they charge on top is well worth it.  Moving on, the tempura was very well done, with everything evenly and lightly battered. Oftentimes Japanese places will be very heavy-handed with the batter, which makes for unenjoyable tempura, but Chaya's tempura was right on the mark.   As for sushi and sashimi, my combination came out with a very respectable amount of food. Then again, it was $32. In any case, the quality of the fish was very good, but not quite top-notch. It was easily the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh, but I have had better elsewhere. I really enjoyed their tuna, eel, and salmon. The quality of the sushi rice is simply superb. They either make their own ginger and wasabi, or they use a better quality, because both are far better than the norm, especially the ginger. My girlfriend's rolls, a Cali roll and a JJ Roll (tuna + cream cheese) were pretty mediocre, but the rice for that was amazing too.  Hands down best Japanese place in Pittsburgh, and I really wish I could give a 4.5, but I rounded down because it's a very solid restaurant, but it didn't astound me for the most part. Still, I'd recommend.
2	heWrV5Kg7MoxAUqtVhtWA	This place is ridiculously overpriced.  There was a large group of us (34 people?) that came here. We made a reservation for 10PM, and specifically told them that we needed to be out of there by 11:30PM because we needed to be at the Bellagio by 12AM.  We all got there about 5 minutes late. They made us wait another 25 minutes. We didn't all sit down and get fully situated until 10:30PM. We were told over the phone that they would section off a corner of the restaurant for us, and we would have 1 long table. we ended up being at 2 long tables, at different parts of the restaurant. They totally split our party in half! The food is ridiculously overpriced. The cheapest entrees on the menu was $28, which was chicken and salmon. Almost everyone ordered either the salmon or chicken. Everyone that had the salmon said it was way overcooked. Everyone that had the chicken said it was way to salty and kept drinking water.  We were also celebrating 2 birthdays and specifically told them. They brought out desserts for the 2 birthdays, but it took them forever. We tried to have them rush the check. We got our check and it seemed like we were going to make it to the Bellagio in time, but we waited about 30 minutes trying to flag someone down and pay them as well as have them charge a couple of credit cards.  Service was ok, nothing spectacular. They also automatically tack on an extra 25% tip for parties of 8 or more rather than the standard 15% or 18%.
2	MHQRbq8Dlf4W8KVRxzwQgA	In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking.   We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers.   With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?
2	ekhL1WjfCIg5Fq5fRzvafQ	My wife and I were excited by an Indian place opening up on our side of the valley. Unfortunately the food isn't up to the standard of the better places in town.  The lunch buffet, one of the big selling points of Indian food for me, features some odd choices and they really let it run down in the last 90 minutes.  Bollywood is OK if you're really craving Indian and can't be bothered driving for a few minutes down Sahara to Mt Everest or one of the many other superior Indian restaurants that Vegas has on offer.
4	Qgpk4xwLYovuHCDRKMe5A	This is the perfect hole in the wall deli.  I believe they are only open for lunch.  When it gets busy, it can take a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.    I highly recommend the EVIL HR sandwich.  But, they have a lot of others, and you could always build your own as well.  The sandwiches come with a small dixie cup full of potato salad or macaroni salad, which are both excellent.    They also have Dr Brown's sodas available, if you don't want fountain drinks.  Seriously, the food is delicious, and service is friendly.
2	fGQLS2dNqkidAO5Uq5MWg	Had the Coney dog- Vienna hotdog with no bean chili n onions.. The chili was good but not superb.  Maxwell Street Polish Sausage- Vienna beef polish sausage grilled with spicy sport peppers, onions, & mustard - The sport  peppers were really spicy!!!   This is suppose to be voted best hot dog in Vegas.. I beg to differ.
4	CQIvkgmhHToNMPIaHrg	I always come here for the breakfast.The breakfast here is delicious.I recommend getting the Country Fried Steak with Eggs and Hash Brown.Although the service is a little slow,it is a great place for dinner and especially the breakfast.
4	7ZqVMyoRBc5Hxyy9mJOJmA	4.5-  very good deli sandwiches, but nothing I would more than 10-15 minutes out of the way for, so short of a 5 for me.  I had the Jay sans dressing, very tasty, well executed. BF had the tuna and was quite happy.   Yay! I'm a fan :)
4	Bmxp7A5asCahrVfXL7gAA	Crazy Jim's is a small greek joint with an eclectic menu. They serve all of the following: sub sandwiches, pitas, burgers, pizza, spaghetti dishes, gyros, baklava, calamari, and dozens of salad combinations.  I've only had their gyros and pizza - both of which I would recommend.  Also - the staff are always friendly and quick in my experience.
2	fJjoXU5ztUrcrWp5Vjksg	Every time I come here the ask me to "pull around" after taking my money. No, give me my food now or give me back my money. The looks you get after saying this is amusing, they don't know what to do, and what do you know? My food pops right out! Thank you sir may I have another
4	Vf03QxKTUlbKUuIMseSsw	I had a problem with being seated in the restaurant but offered the Happy Hour prices.  Apparently our server did not know the Happy Hour menu and brought us all the items NOT on the HH menu.  I was annoyed that the manager there would not do anything about it but the general manager made up for it by appologizing and giving us gift certificated to make up for the high bill.
2	ftYQ887EeQNAfUHjsvndzg	I think this is my first review with less than 3 stars... rough... but i must be honest... It was a lively eatery that caught my eye so I decided to give it a go since my flight was delayed. I ordered the Blue Corn chicken Quesadilla. It was... unsatisfying... the portion was large but I just didn't get the flavor... I also found it a a little odd that if you wanted your order taken you had to flag down someone that worked there that was zipping by. To be fair it was really busy inside.  .::Overall::.  Blue corn Chicken Quesadilla - chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor... the guacamole was kinda bland as well...  .::Recommendation??::.  Maybe the other dishes in the place are better... IMO i would have probably been happier getting a Jr Whopper w/cheese at Burger King haha
2	7Bcvu5GKiD2zV5ZfzebJw	Salt, salt, salt.  Went to Caf\u00e9 Bink last night, for the first time, for dinner with my parents and in-laws.  Let me start off by saying that we are huge fans of Binkley's and think that it is one of the best restaurants in Arizona.  The service at Caf\u00e9 Bink was very nice.  Our waiter was attentive and responsive and actually seems to enjoy his job.  Food on the other hand, well, judging by the other reviews here, they must have been having an off night.  Our table started with some appetizers and soup.  I had the mushroom soup, which I thought was very good.  Probably one of the best things that I tasted there.  My wife ordered the mussels.  Multiple people at the table tried them and they all agreed that they didn't taste right.  They didn't taste 100% spoiled, but they just didn't taste fresh either.    We brought this to the attention of our waiter and he quickly removed the dish and brought it to the attention of the chef.  I was able to see the chef taste the mussels (in the reflection of the window) and his response was that they taste fine.  Strange, but it was appropriate that they removed the dish from our bill.  Next up was Amy's Bolognese.  Everyone has raved about how great this is so both my wife and mother ordered it as their main course.  I could not believe how over salted the dish was.  It wasn't as if it was a little bit of salt.  Salt was the predominate taste of the dish and it was terrible.   We were now starting to actually feel guilty about sending back another dish, but it had to be done as the Bolognese was not edible.  Our waiter was very nice, again, when we brought this to his attention.  He had the manger come over as well.  We told her that it was very salty and she said that they actually get that complaint pretty often.  Really?  You are told that your food is over salted and yet you continue to cook it that way?  Her response was that since many people don't cook with much salt at home they aren't used to it when they go out to a restaurant that uses salt.  While that may be true, I have never had this problem at any other restaurant and I don't think that a quality chef should be using that much salt to define their dishes.  I ordered the Steak Frittes and asked to have it cooked medium rare.  I would have appreciated knowing up front that the steak is actually only a quarter inch think and therefore cannot really be cooked to order.  While the steak wasn't salty, it definitely wasn't anything great.  Bland and boring are the best way to describe it.  My father ordered the Beef Stew off of the waiter's recommendation.  Guess what?  Way over salted.  The other two dishes that the table got were the Scallops and the Fried Chicken.  At least the chicken was supposed to be salty.  While I feel bad for writing such a poor review, I can honestly say that our party was extremely disappointed with the meal last night.  For those prices the food was not worth it.  The presentation was boring and the flavor was totally ruined by all of the salt.  We might try it again, but probably not anytime soon.
2	vbQJnPhITKMCUUGkm9zoGA	My first problem was that I couldn't find the entrance of the place...  The wait staff is very young and polite but can be spotty.  I sat there for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.    The Cesar salad was prepared in the middle of the dining room and it was quite fresh.  I had steak frites for dinner (how original...)  The quality of the meat is just ok, but for the price I paid it seems fair.  The fries are the best part - it's freshly fried and they come back to offer you seconds if you want.
2	uobmrFU5dCfD4EAKwUMgyw	Came here because of the reviews. I ordered the ceviche de Camaron chalupita. It was pretty much aguachiles instead of ceviche since it was so spicy, but it was still good. My bf ordered a coctel... I think it was called la Reyna and it had pretty much everything in it but he had to add ketchup because he said it lacked flavor. Unfortunately it bf got sick and was up all night throwing up. He was sick all weekend from the food. I guess it wasn't such a good coctel after all. Hopefully no one else has gotten sick but be careful when going to This place.
4	1YkIKV9Y792qdNC6qfGuZw	I only hit this place for a very early breakfast. The service is always good. The food is comfort style: too much cheese, salt, and grease. It's fine every now and then but not a regular place for me to hit.   Dining room is clean and somewhat modern.
4	e2EOIeyo4xbthpUNqmDcg	i love this place, its my go to on sunday for chilling out on the couch before work on monday.  crispy scallion chicken extra extra hot with brown rice is my favorite.  pork fried dumplings are also really good and so are the spring rolls.  very consistent, very fast, and they have an extremely nice staff.
4	MSyozGxmn2DM0dVqMylQ	I love going to this place because it's cheap good food.  Were talking fast food here, so don't think that 4 stars means this is gourmet dining...it's clearly not.  But, for the money and the amount of food, you can't go wrong.  I love the double beef double cheese tacos, and the macho nachos are awesome.  Way more cheese on the tacos here than Taco Bell.  Overall pretty good food, nothing special about the service because it's fast food what do you expect.
4	zpKYvuHNDqvOfzPVL7m7Q	Here's what I like about Culvers: Thanks a Farmer Campaign- LOVE LOVE this. THEY LOVE WISCONSIN! Beef, Cheese, Milk, Farms, ... It's clean inside, staff is polite, and generally seem happy to be there. Who wants food served from someone who hates their job? While I wouldn't eat here everyday day, if we're going to stop for fast food it's an easy decision.  Frozen custard all the way!
2	97n9rhRGarCU7d2D6Ip8g	About a year ago I noticed Tusitalla advertising stone baked pizzas.  I love a good thin crust stone baked pizza so pestered The Man about trying it for aaaaaaages.  It would be perfect - we could get pizza and beer and then walk home.  Better in theory than in practice.  Because we were just getting pizzas we opted to eat in the bar.  In the dingy, cool when it was the 70s, in desperate need of a makeover, bar.  We ordered two pizzas (or "pizza's" as per the menu), one off each of the pizza menus.  We were expecting one to be a medium crust and one thin crust because why else would there be two pizza menus?  We were wrong.  The only difference was the actual shape of the pizza, seriously.  And was it REALLY served on a "mahogany board" as per the menu?  I expect not, but honestly why even advertise that?  Who cares?    We ordered one that was called something like "fire and smoke" which was meant to be spicy pepperoni with a spicy sauce and jalapenos.  It was a normal pepperoni pizza with a few jalapeno slices.  I think the other one we ordered was meant to have artichoke hearts but again, there were so few I hardly recall having one.    So our big tasty plan turned out to be a bust.  We could have made better pizzas at home, eaten them in a nicer environment with better drinks at a fraction of the cost.  Boo.
4	zSIPAzuXY95X3l6QrE7dg	Love this place. I always get house noodles and house rice. Only one time the food has been off.  Yesterday I ordered again the usual, and I asked for sweet and sour and chili sauces, I got an earful about next time I order make sure to ask for them so that they are in the bag. All this because I asked for a small bag for my sauces and he refused to get me a small bag instead he took 5 min to undo the maze of a knot he had tied on the bag. All the while he is going on in his native tounge I think he was telling me how much he appreciated my business, finally got my sauces in the bag and I asked him to not tie the bag. Are you sitting down he tied the bag double knot. Beside that great food. I still love that place just chill sauce nazi
4	ybbwKnDWvVXlATM2Jgc9g	I had always resisted going to Rosati's because they don't usually have any seating available, so imagine my surprise (and delight) when I found out that this Rosati's (on Mineral Point) did indeed have seating and full wait-service!  With the first "blizzard" of 2009 breathing down our neck, we ventured over to Rosati's to try their pizza.  Folks at work raved about it, so we set our expectations high.  We arrived and were pleased to discover they were open and that they did indeed have plenty of seating (6 large booths, a few tables, and a bar to sit at).  The waitress invited us in and told us to sit wherever we'd like.  As we were sitting down, she brought us complimentary popcorn, along with the menus.  Tonight's special was fried chicken, but we opted for the double dough meat lover's pizza.  We added a Miller Lite and a couple of sodas for good measure.  Pizza arrived; it was h-u-g-e.  Their "large" is closer to an extra-large if you'd ask me... We took our first bite, and - yum.  The cheese was fantastic - very flavorful, great texture, and perfectly proportioned.  The toppings were tasty as well - fresh and flavorful.  The sauce had just a hint of a kick, which was a pleasant surprise.  I'm not sure that I'd order the double dough crust again (they have thin, double dough, Chicago style, and stuffed); I'd probably try the thin, as the double was just a tad too bready for my liking, but that's really nit-picking on my part.    The service was absolutely awesome - our waitress checked-in several times, made sure our drinks were always full, and followed up at the perfect intervals.  Top notch, for sure!  We will definitely be back.  Rosati's = WIN  Service = 5 stars (fantastic!!! friendly and helpful) Food = 4 stars (very solid pizza) Value = 4 stars ($26 for large pizza + drinks) MIsc = 4 stars (great menu variety, nice seating area)  Summary: It's not often that you get great service from a pizza place, let alone a place that specializes primarily in delivery and carry out.  Combine Rosati's awesome service, huge menu, their delicious pizza, and the great overall value and you can't go wrong.
4	zTByqX2YHhVT9ezUMZiQ	definitely an old school deli. has  that feel. all their sandwiches (even a decent Philly cheese steak and im from the Philly area)  with names of sandwiches like the frat guy, the professor, the freshman, etc. this plays well into the college town vibe. good prices. with a beer distributor next door grab a few cold ones and get food and you got a good meal   prices are really good too. everything is less than 8 bucks roughly, and you can walk in with a ten spot and get a good quantity of food. they don't short your on that here.
4	JaDwynS5dOrR4KDw6InBkA	I am use to going here for teppan (chicken, shrimp, steak) and sushi and have always had a good experience. Better than Benihana! Service and staff is friendly and helpful. This was my first time here for lunch. Prices are great. I also love that they offer half rolls on some of their sushi rolls. I got the Chicken Teriyaki w/ Shrimp Tempura, comes with rice and miso soup. It was very tasty. And it was a good amount of food for $8.50. I also got Unagi sushi, which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends food...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni roll (wasn't as bad as it looks:) We also got different desserts at the end, the Chocolate Tempura Ice Cream was heavy but yummy, tasted like a funnel cake with ice cream. The Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the dish. My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese restaurant), it was reminiscent of creme brulee. The mochi wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long.
4	o5F3MIc2r1WE02Pt65w	This is written by my 11 year old niece.  My first time and I have to say I'm impressed! The crust is totally amazing and so awesome in my mouth! The cheese was a bit chewy though. I would still go back for the crust.
2	Rn0VfugFuD4gVIQ1A0Saw	There Pizza was delicious, I thought it was a little pricey for 4 Pizzas with one topping we spent $70.00 The person that took our order, could not speak very good english, in fact he was rude. I would not recommend this place to eat at all. Find another restaurant in the Village.
2	zzdD9lx5OwZ97M7IuEA	Slow service, even with few patrons. The food was alright. Atmosphere was nice, except for all of the 4th of July shoved underneath credenzas ( a week after the celebration) HINT: If you do not have the space to store it....try a table cloth. This is my second time here. It has not really improved. I usually like to try things at least 3 times, before I officially make a decision, so I MIGHT take another shot at this place, but....I have to be honest, unless this place really knocks my socks off....and I am talking a virtual party in my mouth, I just cannot recommend this place. There are far more deserving eateries within the Lake Las Vegas community that really know how to treat their customers.
4	8Fv4zFCt7K8qgpC964MOg	Used to go here for lunch when I worked nearby.  I hadn't been in since it changed owners.  The salad was better than most pizza places because it has more than just some lettuce, red onion and pepperocini thrown on a plate.  The ranch dressing is homemade and good too.  The pizza slice came out very soon after the salad and it was huge and good.
2	4U77lEdPW1IWKbdKnVSFUA	I admit their food is great, and it's a cool place to hang out. However, maybe this is due to some of the recent fame and attention that they've received but their attitude towards customers have changed! My friend and I went in, hoping to enjoy their yummy food, but once we stepped in, no one greeted us. And about 2-3 minutes of awkwardly standing around in this tiny restaurant, a man came to us and said: "You're probably not going to be able to eat here, but for how many?" we replied "For two please" then we got the rudest reply I've ever heard, "Ehhh- Not gonna happen! Sorry"In a very demeaning tone.   Anyways, I really do hope their service improves. There is nothing cool about being pretentious to customers.
2	9Bth4XFCCyYiyJ57xQ60Q	I craved thin crust pizza and I read some online reviews and decided on Roman Candle. I ordered a cheese pizza and herbed breadsticks to pick up.  When I place my order I confirmed that the breadsticks came with marinara sauce. I drove there, paid, and they handed the pizza to me; they forgot my breadsticks. So they quickly boxed some up and I went home.  When I got home I saw that they didn't include any marinara sauce so I immediately called them to let them know, they said they were sorry and that was it. After I found some spaghetti sauce to dip my breadsticks into I tried them. They were hard, dry and slightly burned. So, I called again and they said they were sorry again and that they would sent a gift certificate to make up for it.  So, today, I received a gift certificate for an order of breadsticks. I wasn't going to redeem it, but then I realized that essentially I've already paid for these bread sticks since the first order I got was bad.   The pizza was just okay. It had too much sauce for my taste and was mostly forgettable.   Other than redeeming the "free" breadsticks that I've already paid for, I will not be returning.   If I can, I will include a photo of the breadsticks in my review.
4	6AaNMGAWqCoLXOs0NFtag	The first thing I noticed about this place was that it was so  . . . anti-Scottsdale. Gone were the snobby hostesses and contemporary deco; in their place an undersized tiki bar with tacky neon beer signs illuminating the reeded wall coverings. And rather than the break-beat/techno that Ra and Stingray have made the sushi bar standard, Ichiban was rockin' bad '80's tunes. Like, really bad. If there were an XM station for VH1's "Awesomely Bad" series, we've found it, and it's on rotation at Ichiban.  The sushi is clever and inventive, with specialty rolls incorporating anything from jalapenos to mexican tortillas. My personal fave is the Chimichanga roll, basically a philly roll with avocado -- flash fried. Unfortunately, the quickest way to my heart is my arteries. There's a fantasmic happy hour from 5-7pm every night with $4 Cali rolls and dirt-cheap sake, and if you sit at the bar you can watch the owner (who personally prepares every specialty roll served) and you're guaranteed an entertaining show. The only downside is if you're not there by seven sharp, you don't escape quite as "happy" with your bill as you might have been.   "We Built this City" almost got it a fifth star, but not quite.
4	cBF0Fro2R5z4jItIUAwGjA	I ordered the vegetarian egg foo young and a some hot & soar soup. Both were very good- both in taste and portion size. It was enough for me and my boyfriend and less than $15. The ambiance isn't that great but the staff was fast & courteous.
2	hsEplmtMO3lcviT8LoXLw	I was working late shooting a bodybuilding show for Muscular Development magazine and got back to my room famished and there were only Dominos Pizza flyers in the lobby but I wanted to try something local instead so called up Vocelli's to have a pie delivered.  Well the pizza arrived fairly quickly but man it was super greasy!  It didn't actually taste too bad but I guess greasy stuff can satisfy the munchies.  The price is right though and a good deal, but I'd suggest other options if I knew of any.  Not the best, but if you are starving and want something delivered this is one option...
2	n95Dc8k0dOlHG6ugy4bRw	I really don't see the appeal of G.Y. at all. My friends go here all the time and rave about it, saying it's the best they've had and it feels really healthy. Either there's another one just around the corner which is awesome or they're just idiots, and I know which one I've got my money on.   To be fair to G.Y. it looks like they try to make their food a bit less greasy than most other places but that's about it. Their dishes are so bland it's unreal, with a complete absence of any flavour whatsoever. It's not too expensive, but with food this boring no matter how cheap it is I won't be coming back.
2	0TZKEsvKAZM1g3FKVBXiiQ	I wanted to see what the hype was all about and to view it in person.  When we ordered it, it was way too thick that we had to cut the wiener in half.  Took a bite and man.... Did that taste yucky.   I love slots of fun, but not the hot dog.
4	DvPeXlf1ibyIC2Q5HQWzWA	The best Chinese food ever! I took off one star for 2 reasons: 1) The mall location does not make for a very cozy or intimate setting 2) The lady at the counter is pretty obnoxious ....no smiles...only glares....rude at times....but i guess that's just a part of eating Chinese food!  In short, definitely go here for the food....not the service!
2	9qYgkbSljmJiFDu7Vt0xBg	This place on it's best day is just alright. The service was OK, actually they dropped my friend's food which resulted in a longer wait. We had the oysters and it was OK (oysters are better at The Southpoint). I had the halibut and it was really dry. $26 for a dry fillet of halibut - yikes!!! The sides were good. The portions are really small. I guess the verdict would be so-so food that is a bit over priced.
4	AcYT9Ed64v38g9Lh5KF7w	Yum! Pleasant experience. We wanted to try it out for a little spontaneous date night.  Our waiter was really sweet. We had some great wine. Derek got a seafood pasta that he said was extremely tasty and savory. I got pesto gnocchi. Huge portions!! Don't eat all of it if you want room for dessert -- we couldn't try any out. :(  I am usually dubious about Italian restaurants but I'd come back here.
2	N0sf27t5CNuezWhgTDlaw	If you want atmosphere, it's a great, great, great coffee shop.  If you want espresso, food, or fast service, unfortunately, look elsewhere.    Every visit here has had me run into friendly, talkative, awesome people, but I go to a coffee shop wanting coffee, honestly.
4	C5vqfndHZdjDeJQk5Dq1Q	The pizza is great here.  I was extremely impressed with them(I got two different types of white pizza, great thin crust, too).  They have specials for happy hour that included BOGO pizzas.  This was in the summer though and I haven't been back since then, so it may have changed. My biggest complaint before that it was a smoking bar...but no longer with the new laws that have taken effect.  Beer was also very reasonabiy priced as well. This isn't a place that I would bring a fancy date, but for good pizza & a decent beer selection, it's worth a shot.
4	Ms6cRAOT11ZIv23LpKrSw	I had the burger again this time. It was not greasy at all and had a nice flavor. I asked for some of the jalapeno cream cheese to try with it. That stuff it awesome.   The fries were thick but not steak fries. I liked them a lot.   The staff was really nice but a bit slow on the kitchen side. I however, did not mind as it was beautiful to sit out on the patio, wind blowing through my used be hair looking out over the desert.   Prices are good, totally worth a drive to New River.
4	iwz4KvVpakHI7n1Bc9B3Sw	My husband and I came here on our 3rd day of our honeymoon to have lunch. He ordered the patty melt which was pretty good. I was craving hot open faced turkey, which they didn't have so I opted for the hot open faced beef. Glad I did! I have to say it was the best I have ever had, the gravy and the roast beef was amazing! And the mash potatoes were very good too. I'm glad we came here, and $2.00 drafts, score!  Also, one of the staff started to sing when we left, all in all it was a great experience. Friendly staff and a clean place to eat.  Hope this helped :)
2	2JOjrk1Ul8enOi8Y9tsWA	I was surprised and relieved to find that Whisky River is not a shrine to Dale Earnhardt Jr. Still, it's a haven for his adoring middle-aged fans and very much a tourist trap. There is even a stand selling Whisky River T-shirts, hats and other merchandise.   If you're not into NASCAR, you definitely shouldn't go during a race, which dominates all 20 TVs in the bar.   Whisky River is a private club, so if you're going for the first time, you'll have to go through the annoying process of waiting in line and filling out a membership form. You'll also have to pay a cover to get in.  Unlike other EpiCentre hotspots, Whisky River's crowd isn't very dressed up. Most women wear jeans and halter tops; most guys wear jeans, collared shirts and baseball caps.    With three large bars and several beer tubs, there are plenty of spots to get a drink in the smoky, packed bar. And I'll admit that watching people (mostly women) tackle the mechanical bull can be entertaining.   A big plus is that it's right off the light rail.
2	y0dAjWCp6egN2XdAurN9A	The restaurant is located on Crescent street which gets tons of traffic. Its located at the intersection and can be spotted because there is outdoor seating available.   Our party ate there during the Formula One Race weekend so the entire restaurant was packed. My dish (pizza) came out late so our server gave us an appetizer of our choice on the house.   However, my major complaint was the quality of the food. For the amount we paid per plate, we should have had better tasting food. It looked and tasted generic.   I would have given this place 4 stars, its just the food dint stand out.
2	zjb62Ndtm5VZM1TviKQkQ	The food was pretty decent, probably the best Chinese delivery in my area, it only took about half an hour even though just eat estimated an hour, but it gave me some wicked food poisoning. I've been sick for two days. My boyfriend seemed unaffected by it, so it could just be me I guess. Also it was pretty expensive and the delivery guy put the sushi on top of the noodles so by the time they got to my house it was hot which was super gross and potentially what made me sick... Oh well. Thought I had finally found a decent delivery place but I won't order from here again :(
2	0IHLIDp9bR6e0XsIltfTsA	We used to frequent the Verde Grill 3 times a week.  We were driven out of the bar area by a VERY loud regular customer who sounds like Rhoda's mother.  The pitch of her voice is at a level that cannot be tuned out!  That being said we decided to leave the sports bar area and move our visits into the dining room area.  Again we used to visit 3 times a week.  Our favorites were the salmon, the chicken with asparagus and rice, the steak salad.  We used to love the crabcakes, the sliders, both beef and pork, the pork tenderloin and wings, and the yummy wedge salad..  We loved the friendliness of some of the servers and appreciated that it was usually pretty busy, but fun.  The food began to be lacking and inconsistent and we continued to come and try to give it another shot.  Towards the end of our patronage they began dropping down the big movie type screen (eliminating two tables and booth settings) and from our observations the only people watching those games were the servers.  It changed from a dining room atmosphere into feeling like you were in someone's basement to watch the big game.  We felt that if we were paying "restaurant" prices that we would do better to go to a different restaurant than to be unhappy at a place where the food was no longer dependable.  We have nothing against a sports bar if that is what we choose, but if we choose a restaurant we don't want a 60-72 inch screen hanging in the center of the window wall.  Cloth napkins, gorgeous view from all sides (except with the screen down) works when combined with amazing or even good consistently flavored and prepared food.  When the staff and management stop to care and it begins to show in both atmosphere and food, it was time for us to go. It is really too bad to depend on the golfers for post course drinks and burgers and to let the amazing building and location languish when there is such a captive audience living right outside your doors in the heavily populated neighborhood with expendable cash in their pockets waiting to spend it locally!  Such a shame.
4	nnqRlROC41nlAXEUTwXRJw	A quick dinner choice but a notch better than Pei Wei for me. i always pre-order and pickup to take home. My favorites are actually the soups - Tom Kha and  Tom Yum ( a sure fix if you are under the weather - cuz you will surely sweat out what you had!!) The coconut shrimp always remind me of back home in hawaii so they are always on the order
4	durcPC8Qe1v6R5Lf0BvC3w	For two years I walked past the singularly unimpressive facade of Timpone's with its dated looking sign, convinced that such a place could only continue to remain open because it was obviously a front for some illegal racketeering scheme or other sinister enterprise.  Then I went for lunch.  I am still not entirely convinced that there is not a vicious syndicate running the location, but I was pleasantly surprised by my experience.  Well-made salads, great food options, and wonderfully arrayed.  I ended the entire adventure with a lovely dessert and coffee and emerged mildly regretful for having judged Timpone's so harshly.  However, if there's a raid one day I wouldn't be surprised. ;)
2	uXuYtR8e14poihG0jCVPA	I was really excited about coming here. I see the ad in Creative Loafing for the $7.95 all you can eat buffet, which sounds like such an awesome deal!! Except...not when you don't really want to eat anything. The restaurant is dark and rickety and does not feel welcoming. The buffet was limited and nothing really had much of a taste.  The first line has a few sauces and a salad with iceberg lettuce, peppers and carrots. The second line had soups and the third had four vegetarian and four chicken options. The rice pudding on the dessert bar was super runny and bland. The cantaloupe tasted a bit old as well.   I love all things Indian but Situl does not measure up. They give you a basket of naan upon sitting down. It too was bland and even tasted a bit stale. We usually eat up the naan and ask for more to dip into all the wonderful sauces, but it was left untouched. I was looking forward to an Indian buffet so close to me, but paying a little extra and going to Bombay or Blue Taj is definitely worth it.
2	c3HhqeQ5v8uv6avDYsrAZA	This review is about the Griiled Chicken Sandwich only.  Or maybe it's the employees at 450 W. Indian School.  Because I like Whataburgers in general.  I tried the Grilled Chicken Sandwich because I didn't want a burger and probably because that great southern sounding commercial voice was touting the excellence of this product in my subconscious.    It was terrible.  I hope it's forgettable.  The bun is cloud-soft white bread.  IT came in its wrapper leaking ??, barbeque sauce and ??.  I don't know if that's part of the sandwich ambiance.  The chicken was worse than bad award banquet rubber chicken.  The BBQ sauce was industrial hickory.  One of those made-up flavors that I think is a BBQ flavor cliche.  It was not a pleasure.  I'm not sure if it was the chocolate shake, fries, or the sandwich itself, but the next day, it was a trip to Dr. Montzuma's for me.    Not a good dining experience.  I won't give it a 1 because they put out a good burger.  But for me, the chicken sandwich is what it is - bird DOA.
4	VCXbxQBQaxCWP859QI3NoQ	I stopped by for lunch and had the Roasted Eggplant, Spinach & Feta Flat Bread Pizza and a Mango Lemonade both choices were delivered quickly and were very good. I would definitely ordered these items again. Service was very good.
4	nC70zEE7AlysdQMWW29N9A	I know I know, I'm a foodie, I shouldn't like fast food. I know I know, there's so much local food around, why chipotle?  But there's just those days. When I just wanna have some guac and chips, and some good old chicken burrito. It's just good old comfort food. And, its cheap! What more can you ask for?  I love the chicken. Most people do it dry, but its always juicy at chipotle. I like the corn, salsa, sour cream with my burrito. I usually share half of it with my man.  The chips are kinda salty though, but whatcha gotta do when you want some good old guac?
4	syWq6Pwzn9XrlAXM8EC98Q	This place is something of an anomaly.  They do a thin crust pizza that is cut into little squares (and tasty little crust-dominated corner pieces).  This is one of my favorite pizzas on the planet.    The ONLY reason I hesitate to give this place five stars is because the length of time it takes the pizza to reach your front door and their prices lean more towards the one star range.    When I'm in San Francisco, I'm used to paying $23 for a large pizza.  Not in Gilbert, Arizona.    If this place dropped their prices a bit I would order from them two-to-three times a week.
2	TZJlWONlrYYdkYwvh66eQA	+Went there for our 3 yr anniversary...first we get there and they only have beer and wine, really? What is this a pizza house, thought it was a steak house?? So that started it off not to so great, but I am 8 months prego so I didnt mind as much as my vodka drinking husband. Being easy going we stayed and decided the alcohol wasnt the reason we were there. Our waitress was so nice, she was on top of it, she was truly the only good part of our experience there. So I ordered the chopped salad I guess you could call it, the one with bacon and walnuts, that was the only good part of our entire meal, the dressing was to die for!! My husband ordered the bone in rib eye, mashed potatoes and veggies, the only thing that was good on his plate was teh carrots and he doesnt like carrots. He ordered his steak medium well and it came out black oh and the best part was, it was a bone in and there was NO bone!! His mashed potatoes were a potato just mashed (barely) with a fork and some sour cream barely mixed in....hard as a baseball, you could literally throw it and it would stay in one piece. I ordered the "turf" for an additonal cost to my hubby's steak and it was supposed to be 6 oz for $20, I had NO JOKE 4 bites and that was all there was, and they were tiny and dry. I told the waitress and she removed the lobster, overall the service and people are great, but really for $65 for 1 full meal, 1 drink and a salad.....I could have cooked better at home for less.
4	WaOfVIrf75jbStrMwpFYrA	Another Great Meal at "My Mother's" this Phoenix location, Maybe its the Salad Buffet, Maybe its the Amazing Lasagna dish Maybe its the Pie, soo good, and 1/4 slices. I really like how the restaurant is glowing with a home made feel with great food.  My mothers food is the best and 2nd best is My mother's in Phoenix.  This location is not so easy to find but once you visit it you will always know how to get back to mothers house.    The Bread offered before your meal is a nice touch and it is delicious.  Aside from the mind blowing Lasagna the turkey pot pie is great as well.  You are sure not to leave from the restaurant hungry.    Happy eating! I'll see you at My Mother's
2	EkpdbddUlTq5BePiMew	This pizza place is hilarious.   We stopped in because we were starving for lunch before CES. We are approached by a saucy lady waitress who is kind enough to get us some drinks and take our orders. When we ask the waitress (who is supposedly from New York) what the difference between the Chicago-Style Pizza and the New York- Style pizza was.... she had no clue.   I don't even remember what we got but it was whatever. Nothing special here and thankfully we didn't get ill.
4	LVmKiDoQ8deQdcOJDaTPfw	Ok so I am on vacation and generally love to try the local hot spots.  But we decided to come to Chillis.  After all I did want ribs.  Our service was pretty good.  He recomened a few late night hot spots and brought me a great local beer.  Devil ale I belive. A great hoppy little beer.  The ribs were.. well they are what you come to expect.    Chillis has great queso dip and friendly emplpyees  it was a good choice.
2	QzumwtcVfTBkzgKzB7DBA	Let me first start by saying that I am a pizza snob. I'm a Chicago native and there are so many fabulous pizzerias to choose from. I've never had pizza in Arizona and decided to give them a try. I got a small Margarita pizza which was basically a snack. It wasn't gross or anything, it just didn't do it for me. They were a little skimpy on the fresh basil, sauce, and cheese.
4	kCo4PcoZXfk48lKFgzNptA	Okay! So this place is better than any Chinese food I've had here in AZ. I used to go to some spot off 91st and Thomas UNTIL I FOUND HAPPY FOOD! Lol it's always busy. Stays with a line (for takeout) cause the place isn't very appealing. The staff is a bit rude and unfriendly. But the food is worth it for me... The only reason I gave four stars is cause THEY DONT HAVE SIRACHI!!!! But I just take it home and use my own! Try it out.
2	YITEJ2mlV4uVLC8ixlznBw	Before the Peoria location opened, I'd never had a Fatburger, I think I saw the chain in other cities but had never eaten at one.  I ate at this one not long after it first opened, and I REALLY liked it.  It was one of the better fast burgers that I've had.  The fries were good, the place was clean, and I loved the number placard that they gave you to claim your meal with its music and burger trivia on it.  The placards went away, and apparently so did the initial quality and cleanliness.  I still like Fatburger burgers, but I don't know if I'll be returning to this location.  I no longer live in Phoenix, so I pretty much only get to Fatburger when I come to town, and always thought of this as a good place.  Well, sadly, it isn't that good of a place any more.  The burgers, in my opinion, still taste good.  But the place has suffered from neglect.  There were only two people working there when I went there a couple of nights ago, and they were out of BACON.  I gently chided the man on the register, how could a burger joint run out of bacon?  He said the manager didn't order enough.  And I guess it was impossible for a shift manager to take $40 out of the till and drive 3-5 miles to buy a bunch of bacon.  Pretty lame, IMO.  That's pretty trivial, but it is indicative of a problem.  There were other indicators.  First, the dining area hadn't been bussed.  Tables were dirty, and that is not good.  Second, the soda fountain had not been properly cleaned.  Several levers were sticky with syrup, and that level of stickiness takes some time to build up.  So proper cleaning procedure hadn't been followed for some time.  Third, again attesting to the dining room not being properly maintained, they were all but empty of the little cups that you load with ketchup for your fries.  They have two large bins for them and probably less than a dozen total available between the two.  To me, these indicate a total lack of concern from the owner/manager.  The franchise is not being properly supervised, procedures are not being followed, and that is a problem.  Let's talk about my meal.  My burger was cooked properly and done quickly.  There were two orders ahead of me and the woman at the grill seemed to be getting orders out speedily.  My cheddar cheese burger tasted good, even without the extra-crispy bacon that I wanted.  I've always liked the flavor of a Fatburger, it must be the meat and fat mix plus seasoning.  The fries, though hot, were a little under-done.  And the soda mix was not correct, I think too much soda water.  I did not get a refill, I nursed the one drink through my meal and got icewater when I left.  This is, after all, Phoenix summer.  I would give them three stars for food, if they'd had the bacon I might have given them four.  So why am I giving them two stars overall?  A couple at a table had a problem with their meal.  I don't know what, but the woman was talking about how she couldn't eat it.  Maybe the order was incorrect or they included something on her burger that she had a sensitivity to.  Regardless, the workers did not satisfy them, as a result the woman complained throughout their meal and said 'This is going up on Yelp as soon as I get home!'  Well, it hasn't yet, so she either calmed down and realized that she was perhaps overreacting or she just didn't get around to it.  But the workers did nothing to placate them.  Any small business, especially food, needs repeat business, and they lost those two customers that night.  Maybe the workers didn't have the authority to satisfy the people with a future comp'd meal, which would indicate that the owners/managers have a weak set of procedures in place that produced dissatisfaction.  I got the feeling that the place was under-staffed.  I never saw more than two people, and neither came in to the dining room to clean.  After the unhappy couple left without busing their table, that table sat uncleaned for over half an hour until I left.  But on top of that, they had very little business that evening.  I arrived around 7pm and stayed for an hour.  One person came in after that picking up an order to go, one family came in just as I was leaving.  That's not enough business to justify staying open.  Maybe it was a slow night.  Maybe they were shot-staffed that night.  Maybe management is on vacation.  Regardless, this location's owner and management need to take a serious look at how this site is operating, because otherwise, they're going to start losing money if they're not already.  For me, there are lots of places to get hamburgers, including Smashburger, The Habit, Steakenburger, Wineburger, etc.  There's lots of places to get good burgers, and all of those locations have better numbers than this Fatburger.
4	GXXc0RLsUuic9kjKelLx8Q	Pretty good pizza.  Alright price.    The pizza has a garlic flavor to it in the crust, which we do not mind.  We're garlic heads.  I always ask for some hot wing sauce on the side for dipping.  The first time I did, I was expecting to pay for it like I do (and you have to pay for everything) at Gus'.  But they just gave it to me, a decent sized container, for free.   I like the fact that at this location, there's a drive-through for phone orders.  I can all in my order ahead of time and then drive over, pay for, and pick up our eats without leaving my vehicle!
4	sEKB0JSIkXlSZ1aQ2G5aA	I really like the vibe in this place. On top of that, our server was perfectly attentive without being annoying and she even cut us a little break on our bill.   We started with the artichoke appetizer, which was disappointing. It came in a cream sauce and was baked and smelled delicious, but just wasn't. The sauce was bland and the artichoke was awkwardly cut.  Then, for the main course, I ordered a pasta dish called the Voodoo Penne that had a cream sauce and a cajun chicken that was a tasty departure from the appetizer and even had a little kick to it.   The wine list was impressive and they offered a few different wine flights. And my favorite aspect here was the decor: very chill, conducive to conversation, and stylish.
4	Demv8iEosHOsIfoOqq802g	My family has been eating at Don Lenchos since moving to the West side in 2007. The service is good and the food is better. Nothing fancy here, just really good Mexican food like your Abuela or Tia would make at home.
2	7qOonQxM9li1WbSc1HZrg	** Lunch Buffet Review **  i went here for lunch probably 2 months after they opened.  I had high hopes based upon the menu--a lot of good non-standard Indian food...  but the food was just OK.  I hate to judge a place by its buffet...    Service was good.  The folks were friendly... but the food just wasn't what I was expecting taste wise.  Their curries needed salt.
2	zVYeB5FJApyL6UiftheHYQ	Checked this place out for AZ Restaurant Week because the menu they were offering sounded terrific. I felt a little guilty after finding out it was in Digestif's old location, but decided not to hold that against them. The service was very accommodating and the ambiance was great.   Onto the food... they brought out a terrific aoli for dipping bread; however, the bread plate only contained 2 little rolls and we were never offered any more. First course we shared both the calamaretti and caprese. We were a bit shocked to find the calamari coming out looking like a giant stuffed shell! It was tasty, but I expected more prosciutto than ricotta; the stuffing was basically a thin cream with bits of prosciutto and thyme for flavor. It certainly didn't pair well with the Cabernet, the thyme and tomatoes brought out much too much acid in the wine. The caprese was good, with excellent balsamic touches, but the tomato wasn't what I would consider ripe. Overall the first course was a nice presentation and tasted fine, but a disappointment from the descriptions.  Main course was the braised lamb shank/osso bucco. With 2 giant shanks, it looked fabulous. The meat was tender enough, but the flavors of the dish just weren't very good. Here I found myself staring at a decadent dish that tasted like mom's old pot-roast. The risotto underneath didn't even work well, but perhaps it was all caused by what I would consider a poorly executed wine sauce on the lamb and surrounding the dish. My friend had the Gamberri Angelotti Alla Carbonera that looked like seafood in a bowl of cream. Very little pasta, but she said the flavors were good.  Dessert was a standard lava cake that was presented very beautifully. The best part was likely the light strawberry sauce provided on the plate to complement the rich chocolate. All in all, the experience was exactly what Restaurant Week is meant for; try out various dishes at local restaurants for a great price and determine which ones you'd want to go back to with a fuller wallet. With so many other great restaurants out there offering amazing flavors and freshness, this one just didn't make my cut.
4	doKC0EK814O8zR6a7F9qcQ	Wow just WOW.  Typically we avod these chains like the plague cause they over priced, the service is horrible and you leave feeling bloated, broke and unsatisfied.  NOT TRUE HERE!  I think we saw 4 or 5 servers during our dinner, bringing different items including our meal. They were so nice and attentive but not up our grill. It was like they telepathically knew when I needed a new drink as I was thinking it. Totally chill with our lil one to.  The food was cooked perfectly. I actually ate an entire big mouth burger, the avacado burger. My wife had the sirloin steak, with the most amazing orgasm in your mouth loaded taters!   Yes...I said...taters.. lol  Fast service, friendly servers, good food... not much more to ask for!  Ohh and Lee, he made baloon animals for the kids made lucy a pink poodle. He was friendlty and we felt bad for not having stripper cash (ones) to give him.  Anyways go forth and enjoy!
2	AvsmxscfInVNB6XZVo4Pw	Although a frequent another McAlister's, this is my 1st time at this location and the service was extremely disappointing. And, after receiving such bad service at the counter I got the wrong sandwich, ugh..And, after waiting almost 30 minutes. Yes, it was noon, but seriously. 30 minutes for a cup of soup and 1/2 sandwich. Crazy! I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, which was good, I got three tortilla chips on the side. I asked some extra chips and was told I needed to pay $1.00.  Seriously? First off, I have always received more than three chips at the other McAlisters and to be charged $1.00 for something that should have been included with my soup, so sorry. I will definitely not rush back to this McAlister's location.
2	Txe8iRNL3dV8uUpz9vFfRQ	I'm really bummed that Carl's jr is starting to skimp on the food. The chicken sandwich has shrunk and the sandwich was 90% lettuce and the large fry was hardly a medium when dumped out. Also Carl's jr has a new rewards app and you get rewards for checking in and the location was selected but said it didn't recognize any Location nearby. I asked the person at the register to help me and she said "I didn't know we had an app" and the other person said "it's having problems". They did even offer to honor the initial register/check in offer
2	gtGZmKN3qQgkL9tSWMqlrw	With Maciano's varied menu I think they run into a case of being jacks of all trades but masters of none. Our meal here, inspired by a $25 restaurant.com coupon was very uneven and despite the wonderful service we won't return, simply because the food had too many problems.  In order to buy the $50 worth of food as required by our gift certificate, we ordered a house salad to share, two pastas and a medium pizza to just get us to our requirement.   The salad, despite being a little unimaginative, was huge and fresh. I probably should have gone with a different dressing instead of the Italian which was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The free bread sticks were, as others have mentioned, deep fried, but I didn't find them greasy - just unremarkable.  My pasta, an alfredo penne with a few add-ins, including meatballs was initially encouraging. The alfredo sauce was tasty and everything seemed cooked well. The big let-down was the meatballs. I can say without a shred of hyperbole that they had absolutely no taste. They weren't even a good texture, being slightly gritty and soft. I tried to season them up with some salt and pepper, but they seemed immune to any sort of flavour.   The Pizza was mostly intended as a take home item, but by the end of the meal we barely wanted it. It -looked- great, but the crust was very odd and hard. Don't get me wrong, I don't like wet, sloppy "New York Style" pizza either, but somewhere there's a nice dense, chewy medium between slop and a rusk, surely. The pizza sauce was rather sweet and unremarkable.  Overall it was fun to try a new place and with our coupon the damage wasn't too great, but I think Maciano's could work on the taste of their menu items. I know "good pizza" is very subjective, so I'm willing to chalk down the pizza as "not to my taste", but the tasteless meatballs and other issues really hold this place back. When you consider that this would have been nearly a seventy dollar meal without gift cerfiticate, most diners would expect something great for this sort of outlay.  It's perhaps telling that my wife and I both looked with regret at a newly opened Little Caesar's we spied on the drive home, considering the mediocre pizza we could have picked up for $5 instead of the unwanted and much more expensive leftovers we had in our trunk.
2	rwz9zsrNb2P8Ci39EG1rw	The food is marginal for an all you can eat type of restaurant. Don't expect anything  authentic but if you're really hungry then it might just be the right thing to hold you up. Certain items are better than others. Sashimi is not too fresh but entrees are ok. Sushi rice is too warm. Good and relaxing atmosphere but the staff seem to hate their jobs. If you have been here recently and rated anything higher than a 2 star then you really need to go out and try more stuff. I do not apply relativeness in my reviews so the disadvantages of being in Waterloo has no effect on my   rating. The reastaurant is rated the way it is.
4	MWHCYosUzLCcwe8FgVlKQ	I stopped by the ASU location this morning as I hadn't eaten breakfast and was hella hungry.   I was quickly greeted and ordered the breakfast sandwich with hash browns. I had to wait a little bit for it, but you can watch them make the food and could tell it was being made with love so I didn't mind. In hindsight I don't know if it was worth the $4.05 including tax, but at the time it was bombtastic. I texted my friend and told him it was great in that "I'm going to have a heart attack" kind of way.   Anyways, I'll definitely stop by for a hot dog sometime...I'm glad there's finally a food place on my side of campus!
2	ldat9M8k4FYtQx0IFrhQtw	2 Stars for being 24/7! First, I knew not to expect the best or even an average meal. This spot is good for a quick bite, to fill your belly, and in general just for a par to sub par meal. You shouldn't expect the best here. Second, the service echo'd that of a Denny's and same goes the food. I would have rated this 3 stars but to be honest its lower than average. The food will not kill you here so no worries. The diner looked fairly worn. It has seen better times but overall to be open 24/7 you can't complain, I guess.
4	ZekMlKVHpCy3Jf3fVH6Rsw	Very good chinese food. My favorite dish is the tofu+shrimp. Also, the only place in Pittsburgh with pudding flavoured bubble tea (it might be off the menu at this point). It's fairly expensive, but I haven't found it anywhere else and it used to be a fav of mine in Mountain View...
4	tYjT10bcTbSwbZFogsKg	Oh, the Hooters casino!  How hard did I laugh when I heard that the old San Remo was being renovated into a giant boobfest?  Oh, I laughed pretty hard.  Now, let's get this out of the way to begin with:  The whole idea of Hooters is pretty offensive to my sensibilities to begin with.  My expectations were pretty freakin' low when I got pulled in there behind 2 of my more machoesque male friends.  I was strangely nicely surprised.  Yes, there are Hooters girls everywhere and I could do without the little orange shorts.  It's also really, really bright in there thanks to the amount of orange everywhere.  It's just a really orange place; aptly enough, the club there is called Orange as well although it would probably take roofies to get me in that place.  However, it had 3 things that I really liked:  1) The martini bar.  It was great!  The atmosphere isn't the exact thing I always go for, but I felt comfortable there.  Happily enough I discovered a college friend was the manager so I got some free libations.  2)  The pool!  It was February and we made our way out to the pool just because and to our delight found a fire pit set back from the deck with seating around it.  It was delightful!  3)  There was a bar inside with dueling pianos.  Not as impressive as the ones at the NY, NY but less crowded and with less expensive drinks.  The non-Hooters amenities of this place were impressively impressive.
4	Cmxyt0iLPMLCFFLzdaYg	Had a great Saturday brunch here.  The food is quite good  and they have all the regular dim sum fare as well as fish for the cantonese banquets.  Portions are relatively large compared to other dim sum places, eg pineapple buns are 3 to a dish and large, similar to bakery size.  Chow mein is given on heaping 6 inch high mounds.  Har gow, siu mai are good.  The salt pepper squid looked good.  Sesame balls were excellent and had mung bean fillings.  Phoenix claws were also excellent.   Overall, this was a very good place to take family to.   Now, compared to California dim sum places this would only be an average place but because I don't have to drive six hours to California and the quality is good, I give this place 4 stars.  Prices are excellent and actually cheaper than many other dim sum places.  Excellent value and great portions will fill up any large family.
2	PcYqALY0ZxfCcnV1uNdkAQ	Just OK. As it the only sit down style Mexurant for 30 miles, I've eaten there a few times. The food is so so. It was better before...the quality has dropped off.   However, if it's busy they fall apart on service, big time. All the locals know, just keep driving if it's full inside.
4	GbTml5rSth6KisSwDUmfqw	Looking for fast and DELICIOUS mexican food? Go to Roberto's and find happiness. Order the carne asada nachos and find bliss (as well as an extra pound or two). The service was suprisingly good. The cashier was super friendly (unlike some of the other Roberto's I went to). She was also very accomadating to the guests. -she replaced someone's ordered happily and even gave them the mistake order. (some places don't even do that!) -a few customers didn't know what to get and she helped them out  Man, I wish I got her name down.   The location is a bit older than the other gazillion roberto's that are around but the bathrooms were clean.  Now that I've mentioned the bathrooms, I can talk about the food...  The food was delicious. I ordered the carne asada nachos and I truly was about to cry in delight. The last time I got it (at a different location) it was very oily at the bottom. This time, it was not. There was so much meat on there I thought I was going to pop.  Did I mention that it was 24 hours??
2	U4RfpIDH4LQzr0x1zLRIA	Given the choices in this part of metro Phoenix, OK. Every time we eat here we seem to have a big bill without much food excitement to go with it. Maybe it's because we ordered drinks before dinner but please skip the G & T. The food is just OK, much worse than our own home made. The pizzas rubbery and salty, fish drowned in a soggy sauce. I did enjoy the steak salad and brand new fresh artichokes but look out for the overwrought, the overpriced, and the overcooked.
2	O0DOBEoWk8KawkEtXvVeWw	I'll be fair. I had a bad experience here once. Maybe they were having a bad day, but it was enough that I won't be back. When four people behind the counter can't manage to handle two customers, that's the sort of service I expect at the Wendy's across the street. The food is good, but the wait can be really long if you're on a lunch break. I've put more hustle into it when I ran a deli counter. It also bothers me that there's no seating. I can't sit down to eat? That's not a lunch break to me.   I would give the place three stars, because the food is definitely good, but this site says three stars is 'A-OK'. Whereas the truth is, I've had better.
2	CjgV1rIPniSfgdo46eA	Not really sure what the big deal is with In N Out...I'm from Illinois so maybe the people living in AZ just don't know what a good burger is. In any case they are nothing special and I definitely don't recommend them
4	bhlbKlxBCpIYqwpGTrXIvQ	I'm a sucker for wings, so on a recent business trip to Charlotte I looked on Yelp to find a good spot.  This is a simple place... kinda of a dive.  It's in a strip mall, and packed with regulars.  Everyone that walked in was greeted by name.  The owner was hanging out at the end of the bar drinking beers, and chatted it up with everyone.  I felt right at home (which is the Pilot Inn of course).  Their onion rings were awesome.  They were homemade, very crunchy with a flaky spicy batter.  The rings were served with a horseradish sauce to kick em up a notch.  The wings were very solid.  A little on the small side, but they made up for it with a great selection of flavors.  I had 5 XXX Honey, and 5 Hot Garlic Parmesan... both sauces were my favorites anywhere.  The XXX Honey wasn't overly spicy, and had a sweet honey taste to ease the spice.  The Hot Garlic Parmesan were also very good.  The chunks of garlic and Parmesan formed a great crust.
4	ordA0KOEEDiLqiIzUHQeng	Very nice people running the place.  They aren't as busy as some of the more popular places in the area (Pho So 1, etc), but they serve great food at decent prices.  About average on the cleanliness for an Asian place.  However, their food is excellent.  Their Pho is great, I've had it a few times and it was excellent - all of their meats (steak/flank/chicken/etc) are good quality and their broth is great.  It's just not in a prime location to attract a lot of traffic, haven't been here in awhile, but planning to go back when I have time.
4	mOBOH8YGl5NKPguAdF4dQ	We arrived with a open attitude. As usual- Yelp had some very negative and some very positive comments. We are new residents to Las Vegas after moving from Seattle.   The restaurant is located in a strip mall of Summerlin- about 12 miles from the strip. The restaurant is family owned with beautiful pictures of the kids. This is definately not your chain restaurant.   The service was exceptional with the waitress filling my coke about 4 times. The meal started with a huge slice of homemade pumpkin loaf that was great.  I had the kitchen sink. It was very large and fresh. It was absolutely huge with lots of cheese and very fresh. There were a few strange things like pieces of meatball. I think it had about 5 eggs and I had to bring half home.  My wife had the shrimp omelette. The shrimp was probably frozen but still very tasty. There was a ton of cheese.  We did not like the potato chips- sliced potatoes with skin on. The fries were kinda mediocre. Next time we order the hash browns.  The total bill was $25.00 which was very reasonable for excellent food and great service.  Atmosphere: Community diner with a ton of local people- lots of elderly also. Not too many kids so it was a very quiet and pleasant Sunday breakfast.  Overall: Excellent value and a great community feel- a definite return visit.  Great value. Wonderful service. Very fresh. Definitely coming back.  Kitchen sink really has everything
2	J3c36kUnLBEvlTAnxQmNQ	Speak up if you want a drink before you've dropped $300 in the machines. It's pretty hard to get served. -especially after 10pm, even if its not busy. When you do get your drink, you may want to order a double b/c it's gonna be a short jigger of whatever you ask for.  The only reason I give this the 2 stars is because they have a really great "Rooster" salad. Unfortunately most of the regulars don't seem like the kind of people that eat much. They seem more like the kind of people that took a break from feverishly cleaning their grout & thought they would take their teeth grinding out in public... Very intense. Lol
2	tWdjIPfIKk9Y5pxN0QNthw	It has changed since before when it was more of a PT's type of setting. The food is good however kinda over priced which all bar food is but the bartenders are kinda rude ... Their pool is kinda lousy as well... All in all it's ok.
4	pMzs2IKoZvaUxrDENdS3Q	Cheap, fast, tasty, and THEY DELIVER! I've ordered both take out and delivery, and I must say that I am impressed. It isn't gourmet Chinese food, but good enough. Also, like any good Chinese food establishment, it doesn't have to be on the menu for you to order it! Pick a meat, vegetables, and any sauces, they throw it in their WOK of magic, and 5-7 minutes later, you have yourself dinner. Hell and high waters will not stop me from returning again and again.
2	Q9dAwtNagnHl7sqDlEkxA	Service is never the best here, but they have good clean flank salad & great happy hour prices. Martinis smaller, but for $5 you can have two! Great Queso dip that is half off until 7.  Great patio if you can tolerate smokers & or music playing on stage. When it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's BAD!
2	hjr8FDHuRIgKswYVAww	Not a good experience from the beginning.  Tried to use a gift card and the website would not take it.  I was told I would have to use my own credit card then send the bill along with my gift card in order to get reimbursed.  Wow! Then when the pork roast I ordered arrived and I made it for Labor Day company....it was tough and tasteless.  Never again.
2	RTGeAC5w7V04ZDsRaHK20A	Once I realized that Sonic was right there, I stopped coming in here (cause I could drink my weight in strawberry limeaids across the street)  but when we first arrived, and we were waiting for my friend to check in for the trade show we were there for.. I managed to put down an order of hot wings in about 3 mins flat.    They were good - the 30+ min wait when they weren't even busy was not, and is most of the reason, I wasn't headed back in there (well that and all the great exercise I got heading to sonic burger)
4	PGJuDw24B7NjA4c54c1YYw	I have been going to El Charro since I was in the womb!  This place is without a doubt a tradition.  The food is good, but not spectacular, the place is small and a bit dingy but like I said it's tradition.  Avoid the margaritas they are never good no matter how many times we try them.    I'm not sure I would take people here from out of town or to show them the great food of Phoenix by any means but my son will grow up with it just like I did, it's just yummy, inexpensive and tradition!
4	RhrjphRdhTZBkFUwebEog	I have been to this Denny's many ,many times over the years. It is close and easy to go to. It is your standard Denny's. The coffee is so so , the staff works hard ,and the food is doable. It has always seemed to be very clean,even the restrooms. There is lots of parking in the lot. The place is always packed,at least most times of the day. Except mid afternoon, that is a much calmer time of day here.  Food is very inexspensive so it is always a deal. It is right off the freeway as well, which makes it most convienant for all.
2	OqDN49Haxjxt6mw8r3NnyQ	The meat eating man generally leaves restaurant selection up to me but he wanted to give this strip-mall Cuban place a shot. After reading a few reviews I figured I could cobble something together for myself there.   We were one of only three tables so service was pretty on top of things. The server/manager/not sure was very cordial but wasn't super great about answering my menu questions. I'm working my way through my Rosetta Stone as quickly as possible but my Spanish leaves much to be desired. Anyway, the yellow rice, black beans and tostones seem to be okay for the vegheads. The rest of the menu is meat meat and more meat.   The rice was unexciting rice, the tostones greasy and flavorless but the beans were smack damn delicious. Meathead's pulled pork something or another had him oohing and ahhing.   Conclusion - He'll probably be going back without me.
2	qqesha7MuTTEcy5eMWSDQ	I wish i could write a better review about Jack in the Box but i really cant. Ive had Jack in the Box before in NC and at other locations around Vegas but this one fell short of my expectations. First off they were severely understaffed and I only saw two employees working in the whole facility. So while one person was cooking the other person was working the drive through and it took quite a while for someone to even notice that I was standing there ready to order. Once I finally got my order they short changed me on the fries and my fry bag was only half full. To their credit once I brought this to their attention, they gave me another bag of fries free of charge. The burger was burnt and just simply lackluster. If I hadn't had better Jack in the Box experiences then this place would have gotten a 1 star but since I know they have better food at other locations I'll give them 2 stars.
4	Z9L3nf0S7hskmh8SldZIQ	Big place, good food, and not expensive. They have a special menu that has 10 items for $4.99 and you better believe it that they're good! I had the Verde Burrito, soooooo good. It was the right fatty kinda pork that iI expect from a mexican restaurant, it wasn't dry like chevy's or any of the other main stream mexican food places.   Our waitress was nice always refilling our drinks. The parking lot is huge, so no worries there, and the best part.... open 24 hours :D So this is totally going to be the late night, out of the office, really really hungry but don't want to spend a days perdiem on one meal kinda place.  Come by and enjoy their super burrito and their signature margarita!
4	fDIHbqb1ODYvOeZpxQfq2A	As IHOPS go, they tend to be a bit busy, especially on the weekend, and such is the case for this location, but that is to be understood as their service and moreover, their food is excellent.  I was in on Sunday 1/26/14 for my fix of blueberry pancakes so I could properly represent national blueberry pancake day and was delighted.  A blueberry affectionato, they were melt on your tongue delightful.
2	aHv2gBkpke4B5VrOpIhUFQ	I wanted to love Pizzuitti's - the location is great, the service is attentive, and the prices aren't too bad for the area. Plus, they have a mini patio that's charming in Pittsburgh's flowering tree season. But, the food wasn't all it could have been - the pesto pasta was nice but not great, and the gnocchi were mushy, as though not enough flour had been mixed into the dough. Did we catch them on a bad night? It may not be worth it to me to go back and find out, given that there are lots of other promising options in the area.
4	YT8vwgmqZTJpHkfLywggQ	Perhaps one of my favorite spots to venture for breakfast. This morning's visit was perhaps a little different this my normal visit but it won't keep me from not coming back.   The kiddo orders the Cheeseburger Club with fries and he gobbled it down...he's not a picky eater.  The mother-in-law wants a fruit bowl, but they don't have any fresh fruit so she settled for the pineapple which is really tasty!  The husband orders a Ham and Cheese Melt with fries and it to is pretty tasty.  I on the other hand wanted something different so I opted for the All you can eat Catfish. I am pretty sure that it was cod, I settled for fries as their hot vegetable was not ready for the day. I can understand because it was 8am in the morning...and who orders dinner for breakfast...but our family.  Service was fast and friend...but the food is nothing special.
4	XjjidKNm4VRyD0dbLq1hMw	On our quest for another good breakfast place up North, we went to the Pinnacle Peak General Store early on Sunday morning.  Although I'd been a couple of times before, I needed this one more visit before writing my review...   and now I know - Pinnacle Peak General Store is all about consistency.  After eating at both the counter and at the table, I know you cannot go wrong.  Service is attentive and sincere.  Your water and coffee will stay filled, and your food will come quickly.  Don't expect the menu to blow you away; it's pretty straightforward stuff.  On Sunday, I had a spinach, mushroom, and cheese omelet with toast and fresh sliced tomatoes.  (I requested just egg whites and that was no problem).  It was much better than I would've made at home, but nothing too special either...   As Thomas said in his review, the gas station / convenience store / cafe / post office combined in one location give this place character... it's adorable and different than the breakfast places you've seen in strip malls and the chains like The Good Egg, Pancake House, etc.  When we were there on Sunday, they had a fire in the fireplace... it felt cozy and inviting.  I'll be back to the Pinnacle Peak General Store when I'm looking for a laid back meal and/or I have a few items to pick up.  We were full from breakfast on Sunday and feeling lazy so we picked up a few things (IE toilet paper) on our way out... no need to make another stop when you've got the General Store!  They've got it all!
4	NNWWhjrBGiXis18hobmEgQ	mi patio is one of my favorite places to start a saturday night.   the combination of mexican and greek may seem scary at first.  when my best friend ordered a spinach and feta chimichanga i was a little frightened, but it was love at first bite.  the bartender is amazing on saturday nights.
4	ZVIrjg8hYVriyiitTYPQg	Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place!   and out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :)   As we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us....   right after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :)  and out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too!  The Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content....   this place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it.  in the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun....   we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed...   i like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)
2	nJW85ePs7FGrBwNP0sTCw	From a couple of months back.  No coffee ready took quite a while because they didn't have cups clean. NO ,really.  No chipotle wings because they are out of sauce. Server walked off before wife could order. 10 plus mins to return so you can guess how this review is going to add up.   Wife got angry with me because my surprise was quite audible re the cup excuse.10-15 mins to locate and clean a cup but at that point I was just hoping to get the meal over with.   Maybe it's my own fault but the service kinda changed from dismissive to not quite hostile but with a degree of contempt usually found  on staff at  tow yards. If you have a gluten free family member it's really really hard to find places to go  but at near $80 bill for 3 GF pizzas, 1 app and no real drinks  it just doesn't have the service to cover  the cost for "ok" pizza.  Really not doing a food review because if you have any reason at all to eat real pizza you don't need to come here:)
4	f7lwjAAsKQ9aTHbiN1ntA	I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable.   When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you).
4	0hubUsQoCWbSAHIw8i2YgQ	I'll admit, I haven't tried any other Thai restaurant in Vegas, just yet.  The BF loves this place because they serve this beef jerky appetizer that is a bit unique and tastes pretty good.  Ocha Restaurant is located right next to a motel, between a couple of chapels...not too far from the Stratosphere.  You can hop on over to Luv-It Custard after wards!  I was there the other day and made it in time for their lunch specials.  Not wanting to fill up too much since it was a late lunch, I went for the standard pad thai chicken lunch special.  For $5.95, it came with rice and an egg roll.  The pad thai was standard and it decent lunch overall.  The real winner was the Thai iced tea ($2.00).  I used to make it all the time for my old job and they make it pretty good over here.  Yum yum!  Overall, a 3.5 star rating.  It's a no frills kind of place.  No particular ambiance or anything, you're really here for the food.  Lunch specials: $5.95 Mondays through Fridays, excluding holidays. 11:00 am to 3:30 pm Dinner specials: $7.95 Mondays through Fridays, excluding holidays. 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm  Update! 04.18.08 - Grabbed a quick dinner and had the rice noodles with gravy.  I had it with vegetables instead of meat and they really loaded up on the veggies. (It looked more like a vegetable dish than a noodle dish!)  So, they are definitely not skimpy there!  The BF had his favorite, the Thai Beef Jerky (Nice tender beef brisket in thai spice sun-dried then deep fried.) $7.95.  I've never had it anywhere else and it's pretty tasty, you might want some sticky rice with it!  We also shared a gigantic order of Thai tea.  You have to request this special size since it's not on the menu, but it's a honking cup!
2	FH8VzByBBxKERHZDqLjMpQ	We tried out the Buffet on a Sunday brunch. This buffet is very limited. On top of being limited the offerings are very bland. Sweet and Sour is neither sweet nor sour. The pancakes cold and soggy. The salad bar was so small that it is basically a green iceberg with ranch pickings.   The service was poor. At one point I actually had to tap a waiter on the shoulder to get more drink service after having already requested drinks about 15 minutes before. Very poor.   The only redeeming quality of the Sunday brunch is the unlimited mimosa, if you can get them brought to the table.  Even the food court at the Palms would offer something more enticing.
4	aXtB95GhLlhm0geE2IwQg	Every week or so I get a mad craving for chicken salad on greens with their crab curry pasta.  The chicken salad is decent and perfectly balanced with the right mix of mayo, shredded chicken, and sliced grapes.    The crab curry pasta is delicious and addictive, but could seriously use some crab. While In Season Deli is a solid staple in my lunchtime diet - the past few times I have noticed the dwindling amount of crab in the pasta.  My lunch buddy Joe and I were debating the better name to describe this dish -- curry pasta with crab extract or curry pasta with essence of crab?  You decide for yourself.   The woman behind the counter (who I think is the owner) is always friendly, chatty and personable - which is always and added bonus.  Pay at the counter, grab a seat outside, eat your lunch on the patio and enjoy the tranquil and quiet brick courtyard - added bonus number two.  Four stars - possibly five if they get the crab situation in order.  Ok, that just sounded gross.
4	TPosPf5xz3EYUkDnToKBKg	the whole "Fresh Mex" fad is in full effect.  These franchise types are everywhere.  Long gone are the days of the battle:  Should I just get Taco Bell or Del Taco?  Now we have these Mexifast food joints.  I have always noticed this place while driving around.  I was on a lunch break one day and wanted to check it out.    I entered the restaurant and was greeted promptly.   I had no idea what I wanted to get.  It seems like this place boast more about its seafood and not just chicken or steak stuff.  I asked the guy behind the counter, "What should I get?"  He was friendly and said I had to try the shrimp burrito.  He said I wouldn't be disappointed.    The restaurant has the typical salsa bar.  All clearly labeled and lined up in their spicy level.  I usually always get a verde salsa.  The cool thing about this salsa bar is that they recommend what salsa tastes best with what you order.  So I got the salsa that goes well with shrimp.    When I got my burrito is was a decent size.  I wasn't too worried about a big pile of food because it was lunch and I didn't want to be sleepy the rest of the day.  I took a bite and it was pretty good.  The mixture of shrimp, rice, and spices were great.    Will I try this place again?  Yes  Will I get it for dinner?  probably not   Either way it was a tasty burrito, so go ahead and give it a shot!   Cheers!
4	2ruqkIj2L6MKTaPaA9uTg	I've only been to La Fonda one time. I ordered the carne asada and was excellent. The best carne asada I've had at a Mexican place.  I've had my fair share living in CA, TX and now AZ. This place tops them all.  I'll go back w/o a doubt to try other menu items!
4	qtMafZQqFkXHhEbByizmw	Golden Flower is the best Chinese food on the east side of Las Vegas. The west side has Chinatown, where you can find many great Chinese restaurants, but on the east side they are hard to find.  I order their lunch specials quite often, which are very cheap (around 5-6 bucks), and give you a lot of food.  My favorite dishes are the hong kong style crispy noodles, and the honey walnut shrimp. My roommate usually orders their orange chicken, which seems boring, but golden flower's version is very good.  Their chow mein is also very good, always serving with a lot of meat and veggies.  Their staff is very good, and have stayed open later than needed several times to make me my food
4	SUJayr8vNedOXFLRhbT8A	A friend took us here after a long day of climbing at Red Rocks. The food really hit the spot, especially the egg rolls! omg, they were so good, you must order them. Freshly made and fried, and they come with a plate of veggies to wrap it in. I had a grilled and shredded pork plate for dinner and it was delicious. The grilled pork was really tender and they gave a fairly generous portion for how cheap the dish was. There's a Chinese restaurant next door if you're not in the mood for Vietnamese.
2	Y3jzhyxfAGpPufSLJeQ	Downtown eats... choices? No not really.  It's just your plain ole average sandwich shop.  The food's not all that but the owners are really nice.  I like to eat here all the time because it's comfortable.  They have a decent Asian chicken salad and a Parmesan roast beef sandwich.    If you are ordering a sandwich tray for a conference or business meeting downtown, I highly recommend them.
2	BlKsmR8lxVsRpFDGM3GMaA	This is for Deb: I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink. I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good. The ice in my cup was really, really cold.
2	AA6QQUFGWWkZlbpat46OfQ	My husband, some friends and I went to this place for restaurant week. We all sampled different dishes to experience a range of items - the multi-flavored french fries, soups, steaks and desserts. While everything we sampled was good, I was not blown away. My steak was good, but not great, and considering the regular prices, great should be on the menu. Also, the restaurant is one main room with hardwood floors, effectively creating an echo-chamber. This is one of my major restaurant pet peeves - you sit down at a nice dinner only to have to yell across the table. I expected more from Michael Mina and certainly for the celebrity chef-inspired prices. A better steak, and better experience, can certainly be had for less.
2	KRJpCxopJaWrvEYl1eQA	My mother used to eat here all of the time until her medical emergency. This place is pretty much a below average Chinese buffet. I wasn't too impressed with the selection and the quality was definitely sub-par,  The facts:  Pros:  1.  Easy to find off of 24th Street in Phoenix. It obviously used to be some sort of fast food place.  2.  Plenty of parking in general.  3.  The dinner buffet was $8.75 which is cheap considering what other buffets might charge.  4.  The selection is pretty decent but very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.  Cons:  1.  A little too salty on most of it's food. As I stated, they are very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.  2.  I just don't think jello belongs in a buffet. It's a cheap option to maximize profit. Not very impressed by red and green jello.  3.  The egg rolls were pretty bad. Yes they were crunchy on the outside but felt undercooked on the inside. That means soggy, which isn't a good thing.  This would be a good choice after a drunken stupor evening when it doesn't matter what you put in your stomach. As for a choice, I would most likely avoid this place.
4	IAWwthMqh0Kv9SdZuW7wSw	Been going here for years and has only gotten better!!!   I love this place its awesome!!!   Ok so when i go here i always always always order there Green Bean Fries there baterd and fried and come with a creamy cucumber wasabi ranch dip there soooooooo delicious i could just go here for this but that's not the only delicious thing there is... after i mmm ooo and awww over my green beans i order there Jack Daniels Chicken OMG this is orgasmic sooo sooo delicious the chicken is tender and the sauce is what makes the dish mmmm had to order xtra sauce bc its so good and it comes with 2 sides i had the baked beans and loaded mashed potatoes.   This is a place i will always return to Ive never had any complaints food is great and awesome service @ this one on Sahara.
2	rKNFXVT8RCZVEOxGeCwg	Sac Wich was good for what it was. I'm spoiled living in Boston because there are a number of phenomenal sandwich shops everywhere you go. Sac Wich doesn't quite compare, but I can't exactly hate on it, either. This was close to the Residence Inn at which my friend and I stayed, so we decided to check it out for dinner one night. The prices were good, as were the options, but I didn't leave with an eagerness to go back. If you're looking for something quick and decent to eat, I would suggest stopping in. As a (spoiled) visitor to the area, I would suggest that you not have your expectations too high, especially if you know and appreciate great sandwich shops.
2	ZVksON8Ar2MDF48cEpirXg	Rare for me I went twice before writing a review.  The first time I went I got their club sandwich which was ok but I wanted to try their Philly cheese steak which is their signature sandwich.  The place is still nice and shiney and the employees are constantly cleaning the place.  Their opening rush of business seems to have tapered off a bit but it was still fairly busy with dine in and take out orders.  Both times I was there about 7PM.  I already mentioned the MJ Club was ok.  The lemonade was really good.  The second time I was there I got the little lemon pie which looked small but was plenty for a dessert and really tasty.  I got the philly cheese steak and the insides with peppers, onions, mushrooms was really good.  It comes with a fork and knife but I forged ahead and ate it like a sandwich and ended up wearing part of it, again.  Where they failed was the bun,  it may have been fresh a couple of days before but not by the time I go to it.  The on table BBQ sauce helped and made for an interesting overall taste but the bread just killed it.  Price wise they are ok but with a drink I was up about $12 each time which is at the high end of what I consider fast food.
4	3QFWQRujazEALAFsOjDsw	Mmm...Macayo....Me like you lots!   M elt in your mouth incredibly delish  A ddicting   C heese that is out of this world  A gain, Addicting  Y ou only wish you had some  O nly in Vegas....Oh, and Arizona  I don't eat Mexican food often though, if I had one of these places close to where I live, I would probably turn in to a burrito.  I'm talken lip smaken, melt in your mouth, wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!!   We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.  This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.  The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try.
4	8AM7efE2PsGt7D9dCcQKA	Atif is right - it is definitely the best samosa I've ever had - I've had the beef, chicken and veggie. Very tasty, fresh and hot. It doesn't look like much from the outside. But it very well is a full indian restaurant. I really like the Na an bread with garlic or onions here. Very tasty. Plus this is one of my favorite places for Tandoori chicken.  I've yet to try the curry because I'm a creature of habit with indian food. I mean don't get me wrong - I really like the spices -and spicey. You know the prices have gone up? Regardless it's still good. Definitely worth it. The staff is friendly and patient - I mean I had a white dude with me and she didn't even get mad because after 3 visits he got what I got :)
2	tKhq4hAaQDYv7jJ7uuFaQ	I have to edit this because I just ate there tonight and had a not-so-pleasant experience. The restaurant was empty, it being a weeknight and all, but it still took us forever to get our food. We ordered soup and then several minutes later the waiter came back to take the rest of our order - the food we ordered later came before our soup. Not cool. We ordered a beef curry and I lost my appetite in response to the fact that the beef was not tender at all, in fact almost crunchy in a way. This was a very uncomfortable experience... the hostess even seated us at a small cramped table instead of a more spacious booth despite the fact that it was empty. We were one of out of three parties in the entire restaurant. I think I won't be going back here anytime soon.  Not to mention that the party next to us seemed like obnoxious working adults having a mid-life crisis in need of a trendy and exotic foray and proving their capacity to be interesting and exciting by eating thai food, trying to act like some sort of thai savant by ordering a 'thai beer' that was actually chinese. Yeah.  _________________________________________________________  Old Review:  The Thai food here is definitely Americanized and not as spicy as it should be, but I'm always more satisfied with a place that automatically brings out the spice dishes so that you can instantly add more spice to your plate - also helpful when sharing dishes / ordering for groups. The decor definitely looks nice, although sometimes I question whether certain aspects are actually 'thai'... nonetheless, friendly service, I've never had any bad experiences, and if you are a student in the Oakland area, this is probably the best choice for thai food...
2	GRiFU6Fd0y91W8HW1qw0g	My husband and I went to this restaurant for brunch based on everyone recommendation of this place.  Not worth going.  The only thing that was worth eating from the brunch buffet was the chicken noodle soup.  I ordered the hamburger and truffle french fries.  I expect the hamburger to be phenomenal but sadly it was not, the beef taste like meat gone bad.  It's sad that a steakhouse who charge $29 for a burger couldn't even do it right.  Conclusion? Feed your palate and conserve your doll at La Village brunch at Paris.
2	LvFkYOzbqVIDg5kXThB2Yg	Hi, I'm yet another ex-Vancouverite complaining about the quality of sushi in Montreal.   The good places I've been to so far have all been expensive so I've been trying to find cheap yet edible sushi.  This place isn't cheap (Take-out for two: $40. Average back in Vancouver was $25-30), and the sushi was just ok. They cram their specialty rolls with vegetables instead of raw fish. And the "tempura" in their rolls is simply panko crumbs.   At least they take credit cards! But I probably won't be returning with mine.
4	X7rnhQziswCzon6UM7n0ew	Our little family went here for lunch on a Sunday. We go there before the lunch crowd and we were totally digging the scenery. We sat in the closed in patio over looking the golf course. My husband has played the course a few times which started a conversation about moving to a golf course. That's another story...  We went hoping for a brunch, but all the items on the menu (even weekends) are lunch/dinner items. However, the special for the day was bananas foster waffles. We both go that and, oh my goodness, was it good!!!  I didn't eat again until late that night and it put us both in a food coma. The orange syurp was amazing and everything went so well together!   The downfall was our mimosas were about the same price as our entrees, so our total bill was $60 for breakfast. However, I do get to go back in a couple of weeks for a reception with some fellow alumni, so I am happy to know I will be trying other foods there also!
2	Khlg3J6KJ4pRKwpNWxFXzQ	I went there with my wife and three sons. Before all this, I was at the front desk confirming our reservation. I booked the hotel online. The stay mentioned kids under 12 years eat free. When we got to the Buffet Restaurant we tell the hostess that two of them are under 12. (kids eat free, right?) !!NOPE!! "You have to tell the front desk clerk that before you come here" So, that's how they get you from the start. The desk clerk did not tell me this even when I told her we have three kids staying with us. The wife & I felt "tricked" and we felt the place was "laughing" at us. But, the food was typical like any other place. Not too bad. Tasty mashed potatoes & a variety of desserts. We slept at a Non-Smoking building but, the lobby smelled like cigarettes.
2	rADYpRLhGJVKyfbMEaegQ	The staff are unfriendly except the young man this morning. Not one smile from the 2 girls... they only serve breakfast in the a.m. although i am unsure why i couldnt get veggie bowl unless the rice wasnt ready??  My kid had the bacon breakfast burrito, said it was ok. You can get a drink and guac added to your meal for 2.99 but no chips so unsure what the point of the guac is... wont be back even though i come to the airport 2-3 times a year... not because of the food, but because of the 2 girls... the airport is miserable enough....
4	gdBRv2emZqJDy2QyQZTWw	Great drinks TIKI style!!! Think Trader Vics, but in a smaller, local independent place... The food is excellent and the drinks are amazing! Awesome place to hang out for the evening. It also has a really nice patio.
4	v258CiJOd8gtIycXIjpIsg	so we've recently moved into the deer valley area andare always looking for a good little watering hole and good food is always a plus. well this weekend we decided to check out this place,  since a client of mine had told me about it couple weeks prior. on first glance i was a little turned off by the pungent fish smell and all the animals on the wall , which i had been warned about so i got over it quickly. a friendly waitress walked us out oo an air conditioned patio.... a what!? yes an air conditioned smoking patio. mind you i dont smoke but the boyfriend does so i still get sucked on to the usual hottness of patios in our fabulous summer heat. After we chose a table Andy, the quick bartender took our order and kept up the speed and grace through out the evening. we didnt eat this night but came back the very next night on our way to my boyfriends gig, he is in a great band called Radiofix! for a quick bite. sandwhiches are definate bar food and boy were they tasty. i had the julies chicken sandwhich fresh grilled chicken breast with melted pepperjack cheese with a fresh green chilli on grilled sourdough with a good size basket of fries. all the sandwhiches came with fries or another option dont remember what. we will definately be going back to this little dive bar hole in the wall. might even become regulars. especially since it was so inexpensive!
4	Y3QjzCbG6AMyleOnqxBBoA	I love ordering from here but they almost never arrive on time. I live on campus and I understand it can get confusing but sometimes, they call almost 20 minutes after they should already be here and ask for directions. Great food...taste homemade and authentic. Maybe I'll have to start ordering in store.
4	RCHSPjx3iHUUpmvrh9e1g	http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/141554263.html  Closing by the end of the month. Usually I would be sad that another piece of my hometown's history is biting the dust, but since this is a place that really just doesn't care about that, I just feel really numb upon hearing this news. It's still sad though. Thankfully some free time is coming my way so I can pay this spot a visit.  The Final Verdict (since I didn't do it last time):  Pros: Out of the ordinary. An independent drugstore, something which is very, VERY rare these days.  Sells a wide variety of items. Vintage Vegas photos and posters adorn the walls.  Cons: Grungy. I don't think I could stomach the diner (and yet that's the part that's going to stay open. Well isn't that like rain on your wedding day?)  Suggestions: Make it a tourist attraction? On one hand it could keep the place open and provide a tourist attraction that isn't so, well, typical for Vegas. On the other hand, it would stop being a secret and therefore lose it's secret charm.   Would I return? Absolutely, shame the place is closing.
2	aP9kG6CS8gOUA1i0EQcaQ	While trekking to the neighborhood Apple store, we thought we might give this place a try.  Being that it was happy hour, DH and DS and I took a hi-top table in the bar and settled down looking for some good food (we could smell those burgers everywhere in San Tan Village!).  DH ordered the Asian Fusion combination platter which had Southwestern Egg Rolls, Chinese Potsticker, and Tempura Shrimp.  At $11, it was a little pricey but it was a decent portion for a dinner and would have been a shareable appetizer for 2 or 3.  Presentation was nice and the sauces were tasty.  DS ordered the BBQ burger which was a nice sized burger. Interestingly they didn't ask how he wanted it done which meant in my world, I was having nothing to do with it. I can't stand a well or medium-well burger and that is exactly what they served up. And it came with a pile of garlic fries.  The verdict is still out on those.  DS, who lives for anything garlic, even remarked that they were just a little to heavy-handed with the garlic seasoning on them.  Oh - and one other thing that just slayed me - yellow mustard!  In this day and age of $11 burgers, please chef, freaking offer something other than yellow mustard!  It is like setting a table with the best china and linens and then giving someone a plastic fork - there is a time and place for yellow mustard, but not on anything other than fast food.  DS and I both had  the Lobster Bisque.  At $4.50 a cup, I had high expectations.  Wow. Such a disappointment.  It arrived with a swirl of sour cream on top so I had high hopes at the start but......there was nothing in it. Not a speck of lobster. Yes, it was rich, Yes, it was creamy.  But NOTHING in it. It was lobster-flavored bisque.  Oh, wait, yes, there were some lumps in it - not sure if it was some roux that had not been whisked in (doubtful) or more likely the pot scum that you get with cream sauces. So this is off my recommended list - if you are going to have bisque, put something in it besides soup base and white sauce - heck, I can get that from a can of Campbells.....  I ordered the Turkey combo (1/2 turkey sandwich, and a soup or salad) opting for the house salad.  Interestingly enough, DH ordered a house salad on the side - his came with spiced pecans and way more cheese so realize this is not a full house salad included in the combo.  The turkey 1/2  sandwich came with watercress mayo which was heavily laden with garlic (it tasted oddly like one of the sauces DH got with his platter - I think it was just the overwhelming garlic flavor that made everything taste alike).The sandwich was a decent portion and was not a bad deal with the salad for the price but I ended up eating it without 1/2 of the toast since that mayo was just - well, for lack of a better term - gross.  It was too overwhelming of a flavor with the mild turkey.  I'd recommend asking for it on the side and deciding yourself.  Service - well, that left a lot to be desired. It was happy hour and the place was dead except for the bar.  Asking for dressing on the side of the salad was ignored. Could not get extra napkins or much attention at all.    All in all - it was okay. Nothing I would go out of my way for.  Our bill for three, including tip, was $64. That included one beer, one soda, and the above food. I thought a little overpriced.  So next Apple visit, we will venture and try somewhere else.

I have eaten here several times and I have not eaten a Vietnamese dish ever.   The Vietnamese food maybe good but I can not comment on that.   Laos is very close to Thailand so the food has a more Thai flavor.   The Laos salad is very flavorful but too light.  You still feel hungry afterwards.  The egg rolls are great.  The best dish here in my opinion is the Pad Thai.  This is really the only good Pad  Thai in Charlotte.  It has the perfect combination of sour, salt and sweet just right.  Most Thai restaurants mess up this combination with too much sweet or salt.  Some other recommended dishes are seafood, chicken, or beef in chilles.  They put fresh jalapenos and stir fry this dish.  A friend of mine ordered a beef  with vegetable dish which was also very flavorful.    Most dishes can be ordered vegetarian as well.
2	8txNn2dh489FCE0rbfyfhw	I had a really poor, over-priced veggie burger here. The place was full and busy at 3:00 in the afternoon, so apparently it's popular. I'll give it another chance, but even the salad I sampled from my dining partner (since mine was so bad) was just OK.
4	rBj3j7UkXOWBt3c4jkHjfQ	Very good diner.  My family and I hit it up on the weekend's for breakfast or late lunches at least once a month.  Staff is always friendly and service has been great, especially with kids.  Breakfasts are very good with the standard breakfast fare and priced very reasonable, don't feel bad adding that extra order of bacon or pancakes.    Lunches are also pretty standard fare for a diner but taste great and the prices again are very reasonable.  The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star in my mind is just the fact that it is a standard diner, no frills, no interesting twists on anything, but very solid.
2	y6q8dNptKB7zKIMoOdKwRQ	Seriously?  I must have come on an off day. Other reviews sing high praises of this place, I'm not getting it. My food was bland like I had a head cold, no flavor at all. I was worried when my hot sour soup was nether hot or sour. And how rude is it the owners children where playing in the dinning area?  The counter person was very nice, that's about it.
4	QzNwiSvEqQwWsitGmiGXOw	I'd always heard tales of the fabled Sonic Drive-In, but it was like a whisper in the wind or a thief in the night...I never truly believed. Legends with tantalizing visions of juicy burgers, golden fries, creamy milk shakes, and flavored sodas came across state lines into Los Angeles, but how could such wonders be true?   What began as an ordinary day would end in a night forever seared into the archives of my mind. As we were blindly driving through the dimly lit streets of Phoenix, an illuminated sign appeared to us, as if an answer to a prayer. Sonic came to us all at once in a haze. We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings, popcorn chicken, a corn dog, chili tots, and shakes upon shakes! Oh, the bargains! We laughed! We danced! We wept! The next morning, all I had was the echo of a stomach ache as proof of the marvels of the night before.  Maybe, just maybe, if I clap my hands enough and really believe, one will suddenly appear in the South Bay. One can only dare to dream.
2	8oC1OqvoaB2pSdTdVmPHw	I visited for lunch with two friends and thought it was just okay.  The service was less than ideal - they seemed to ignore a table of twenty-somethings to fawn over Ladies Lunching; the waitress was one who doesn't write anything down and brought me the wrong wrap; and there were occasional long delays.  Our group ordered the crab cake, the penne, and the vegetable wrap, and nothing really stuck out.  My wrap and sweet potato fries were very bland.  Desserts were the definite upside - perfect creme brulee and raspberry cheesecake.  The restaurant is also very pretty and there is excellent people-watching.  But the food is just mediocre.
4	0O16u1L2RsIxJMGu9U4w	Love this place.  I love the atmosphere.  Love the outdoor seating in Summer.  LOVE the food - delish!  My only gripe.. half the staff is super helpful the other half acts like you are annoying them by wanting to place your oder.  Especially with my order because it is unique.  Most small businesses don't have staff with attiude problems but this place has a few.
4	dD3jW89M3Lsslf5wYWmEA	My Grandson loves it says burgers are bigger and better then other fast food places but I find the price you pay for a meal you could go to a restaurant and get full service for the same price or less.
2	vtjefAEO5Me29l119oPA	This place based on what it could be... is a Dud.  Food is so-so.  Salsa is like marinara sauce. They say it is fresh guac, but it looks and tastes like it is out of a can.  They have cool yelp check in discounts.  But the food is just average.  I think Sandbar has just as good food, and better chips salsa and guac, if you are looking to do Bar type Mexican food.
4	RII81DGf85zVkd88YE6Uw	Food is same as any other Taco bell and comes out fast. Whether I'm dining in or in the drive thru, I've never had a problem with my food coming out quickly. Never gets too packed at this location either which is why I like coming here for lunch.
2	7BsKq9SgVL21oayWwJ1kiQ	If you're looking for cheap and cheerful Italian food Bar Napoli is the place to get it.   The quality isn't great; however the waiters are funny and cheerful, it's easy to get a table and the prices are low. The 3 course lunch for \u00a34.45 (how on earth do they manage it?) and its proximity to Princes Street ensure that there are always people eating in here. I'm generally suspicious of restaurants that have huge menus and Bar Napoli has a HUGE menu, so it's probably a good idea to stick to ordering popular things like margherita pizza and spaghetti carbonara: my rationale being that if lots of people are ordering it, then it's bound to be fresh.  I'd advise you to avoid the antipasti platter and not to bother with the stale bread, probably a good idea to go somewhere else for dessert too.
4	NifG0Wak4rc00BHj22nuXQ	The Hole-in-One, has not changed seemingly for ever.  You can count on their food and serve.  The food is fixed to the taste of its customers.  Not fancy, just basic neighbor hood caffee food.  They have the community table in one side for the daily locale customers, as well as ample booths and table.   Stanley they are open half days Sunday so their staff can have at the very lest part of Sunday off.    I have are adding some new items as over the past couple of years  or so, such as French fried sweet potato.
4	PH5H7rYFkwclBXusH0Pmw	I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.  The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.  Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.  Negatives: - The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an "old" look, it could really use a facelift.  - They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.  - Wish they were open late!
2	mNYeIxtRqYTwEwJjW00d6Q	I am on a 2 star review tear!!! This place was just Eh. It was billed as a great burger from my brother. He let me down for the first time in my life. He said it was better than Burger Bar. Oh, Jacob...   I ordered a burger with Swiss, caramelized onions, and portabello mushrooms. This is something I get at Burger Bar and felt this was the only way to compare. It came out hot, which was nice, but for something that should have been full of flavor, there was just nothing there. I can't explain it. Maybe I should have pulled a Richard Z and dumped the Dead Sea on it. The bun was nice, though. So I left the table after dropping $16 on a burger that tasted like nothing.   The restaurant looks nice. 2 stars.
4	c1I69y1P1fPqh336Moezw	I used to live right down the street from this particular location of the local chain.  I was newly single, in a new place, and really, the last thing I wanted to do some night was stay at home.  Well, my house wasn't exactly anything close to being central, and there weren't a lot of other options if I didn't want to make the trek 'into the city,' so I ended up  here a lot.  It's just a little restaurant and pub comparable to PT's and the like, but I always liked it a little better.  First of all, as a restaurant they serve up traditional American food and do it well.  It's not legendary fare, but their breakfasts are great and they do bar food (wings, nachos, fries, etc.) as well as can be asked.  Their barkeeps are quick and friendly and drinks are reasonably priced.  They've got a few different game options and a pool table, and the place is always comfortable and clean.  It's nothing to make a trek out for, but if you're in the area it's one of your better choices for food/drinks.
4	ci8ulMiodtJPRZUjrcr7WQ	Oh Riccio's how I adore thee!  If you are looking for some good Italian fare then you should try this place out.  I've never gotten anything in here that was bad and most of the entrees are wonderful.  It's worth a trip there for the complimentary garlic knots alone...yum!!  I give them a solid 4 stars because while the food is great it's not really 5 stars great.  Also the atmosphere in the restaurant isn't the best in the world but considering it's in an older strip mall they are doing pretty good.  I haven't tried the pizza before but they seem to sell a lot of them and the wait staff and owners are always super friendly.
2	080M70XVWNJWIXbxBSKgqw	On a family vacation in Vegas last week we ate at this restaurant and experienced the worst service I think I've every experienced in my life.  We were at the restaurant at opening time in order to make a show a little later that evening and everything moved at snails pace from the moment we arrived.  The real capping moment was when after a very long wait for our food my 6 yr old's food came out incorrect.  There was a complete lack of regard from our waiter and most of the restaurant staff as to this issue and while they did finally bring a replacement there was no urgency and no apology.  In fact the replacement came 15 mins before our show was about to start so my daughter was never fed.  That's 1 3/4 hours to get a pizza.  The only reason I'm not giving it 1 start is my wife liked her food.  Did I mention the point when the waiter poured water on my Dad, or when the wine was delivered but then not opened for 10 minutes....
4	MlCLtAT70rLBkYN0hNPXdQ	This is the best pizza in Oakland. That is saying a lot because there are several good places in the area. Since the location is a bit away from the center of Oakland, this place can get very busy for dining in. I have found the best time to go is about 1pm on weekdays. The hospital people usually fill the place at 11am and the office types jam the place at noon. If your going to eat there, make it a late lunch.  My only complaint is the location and like another reviewer has stated, they don't often deliver.
2	yhDImzaIJANgKxjdSHaJtg	Dinner for our party of 12 could have been called "Comedy of Errors", except that it wasn't funny.   Only 2 people in our group left "satisfied", and that judgement was rather generous. One steak was cooked well and a tuna salad did what it was supposed to do. The rest of us were shocked at the poor quality, inconceivable choice of cut of meat served, and inconsistency between exact same dishes.   A "sushi grade" Ahi tuna steak piece ordered "blue" was so hard to cut that we sent it back. It came back over 10 minutes later. A "king cut" roast prime rib was 35% fat, the rest was tough to cut. Rib steaks were tough and tasteless.   Thank you to our server, Chris for his always courteous service and quick responses and to dining room manager Nicole for calling it like it was. Credit them (and the desserts offered on the house) for the second star. Otherwise this was an easy 1-star review.   As much as I was excited that they are back open, I will have a very hard time going back to the Biftheque.
2	s76O7meM8FYTVo5e2oeSQ	I have heard so many good things about the Library Cafe and I left unimpressed.    I know it is meant to be small and cozy but I felt really uncomfortable.  It was really cramped and it was tough to find a seat.  The high top tables are hard to eat at, so I ended up in the corner.  I was only with one other person and once people began to move chairs around, we were trapped.    As it was my first time, I was confused that the menus were all on the front counter.  So the line grew as people contemplated their order.    I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with tossed greens.  The sandwich was good.  It wasn't great.  It was a chicken breast, with pesto, cheese on a sandwich, exactly what the menu described.  The "tossed greens" were chopped romaine lettuce with balsamic vinaigrette.  Delicious but nothing spectacular.    I would come back for Happy Hour and sit outside.  Until then, I will probably skip another lunch trip.
4	wHGBAIqWcZWuTXeS3Rs7WA	I've never really been a coffee house kind of guy, but then I'd never been to Inside the Bungalow before yesterday, when I found myself in Mesa with some time to kill. What a seriously cool place. It's an old house - a really big old house - with lots of little private corners to sit and eat/drink, chat, read, compute (apparently they got free wi-fi, but I didn't have my laptop with me), just chill, whatever. If I lived a little closer, I would totally hang out here. They've also got a giant patio with a fountain out front - a little hot in the afternoon this time of year, but only for another month or so..
4	ucJRgDojr9YCuMSVVv4wcQ	I had given this place a lackluster review from a visit a few years ago and never bothered to go there again. A few days ago I got an invitation from the owner to try the food again and hopefully be more impressed. David, the new owner, told me that they had just taken over the place and were looking to focus on great food and customer satisfaction. We ordered a pizza and appetizers this evening and came away very impressed. The pizza was the Double Dough with sausage and onions. The Double Dough is between a thin crust and deep dish, as far as the crust goes. It was baked to the right consistency and tasted very good. The sausage chunks were big and it looked like the onions were even caramelized. The cheese and sauce were both good. Overall, it was a very well-made pizza and very tasty. The appetizer that we got was a sampler platter. They had just got new menus, so I think the sampler name changed from what was on the previous menu. It included wings, fried mushrooms, mozarella sticks, jalapeno poppers and onion rings. I sampled the wings, mushrooms, mozarella sticks and jalapeno poppers, and let my wife and kids give me a rating of the onion rings. All of the appetizers were very good. The wings were barbecue, and they were slathered with sauce, which was tangy. The fried stuff was fresh-tasting, unlike the freezer-burnt flavor that fried food at some restaurants has. The jalapeno poppers were just hot enough to warrant a cold swig of beer to chase them down. They gave us plenty of ranch and marinara for dipping.  This place is pretty small, but they do have seating outside and a few tables inside, which I think they added since I had been there before. It looks like it would be a good place to stop for lunch, as there are alot of options, from pizza and sandwiches to burgers and hot dogs.  We were happy that David gave us the opportunity to sample their food and give them a much needed second chance. It is only a half-mile from our house, so it's very convenient for us. We will definitely be returning and telling our friends and neighbors about the good food that they're serving there.
2	WWBGEqinMuMFDFaxfsnWw	They seriously need to do something about the loitering part at the drive through... That discourages me to even attempt to get some from there knowing there are strange people lurking in the corners... I bet they have drug deals going on outside in the parking lot and nothing changes... Change the atmosphere around and maybe you won't get worried customers... And stop over frying the fries...
2	tssF7eEFHHKdvj7XN76RQ	Absolutely terrible.  We ordered pizza at 3:12 pm and we're told 40 minutes. At 3:40 I checked the online tracker to see if it was almost done and saw it was taken from the oven at 3:38. At 4:22 I got my pizza. I live 1.2 miles away. The delivery guy handed it to me and said "sorry about the wait, it still feels pretty warm." You're joking right? I just paid for a soggy, cold pizza that sat on their counter for 40 minutes. Their pizza is not great when it's hot, it's disgusting cold.
2	D81cxtbVDILJIEXS8DYLGg	I have eaten at other Garcia's before, but this new location isn't as good.  I ordered a grilled sirloin burrito and the steak tasted rancid.  The server replaced it without issue with my second choice of Monterey Chicken.    The kid's meal came with fries that were dripping with oil and soggy.    I wouldn't eat here again.
2	eJywzQ3q7aBosD495s1w	Barmasa was a little bit of a letdown after my boyfriend kept telling me how good the one in NYC is. He's also a bit of a sushi snob.   Anyway, we had 7:30pm reservations, which we figured would be enough time to eat light and head to the Rio for Penn & Teller at 9. Little did we know that it would take 30 minutes from the time we placed our order, to the time we received our first dish (Kobe Garlic Soy Steak), then another 30 minutes before we received our Sashimi Tasting and plate of 6 Nigiri sushi pieces. Everyone around us, who got seated and ordered after us, got their sushi before us and much faster. Service, nonetheless, could have been MUCH better. Granted the place just opened 10 days ago, for the price we were paying for the food, we expected better than average service. This was unacceptable.   The food, on the other hand, was high-quality sashimi/sushi. Sure, the pieces were small, but there are not many places you can get the selection of fish they have outside of Tsukiji fish market in Japan. The prices are what they are because of the environment you're in and the quality of the food. Don't go in expecting the same mediocre rolls you see at the corner Japanese Sushi bar run by non-Japanese. The other commenters below (except for Jen L.) had ridiculous expectations. This is a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel. If you're going to try Barmasa (or Shaboo for that matter), expect a significant price tag and a menu of different kinds of high-quality fish (and meats -- kobe and wagyu) that you won't normally see.   All-in-all, I hope that the service becomes more polished fast. The food alone would have warranted a 4-5 stars from me, but the fact that the waitress didn't know what she was talking about and our orders took considerably longer than it should have keeps me from rating Barmasa greater than a 2. I'll stick to the one in New York City.
4	wudRbr1KT3y5hytCXM482w	I've been coming to this place on and off for about 3 years now and I love it. Wen I'm really in the mood I'll even drive out from across town for it! Their crab puffs and teriyaki chicken are the favorites coupled with, what I think is, the BEST fried rice ever! I think it's the bean sprouts or something... Seriously though, they're not much to look at but they're super delicious!
4	9sSEcsGpcPmGejYCDXIQ	Had it not been for Yelp, I may have gone my whole life without eating here.  I have to believe that because I've driven by this place SO many times and went "Oh, Mexican food place" and within a few miles I'd forgotten all about it.  Silly me.  So this place totally started out as a house.  Lots of little rooms and funky spaces.  There are actually two different entrances - neither one as the official "main" entrance.  And conveniently there are two different counters at which you can order on the busy night we were there, I didn't see more than 2 people in line at any one time.  Order food at the window.  They call your name and you go grab your food.  Chips and salsa are $.50 and while they aren't particularly exceptional, it's worth grabbing especially if there are several of you.    I got a combo to try some traditional standards.  Prices are cheap which is great.  My combo (6.95), drink (1.75) and Chips(0.50) and salsa came out to just 9.95 after tax.  The taco was really good, a bit greasy, but not bad at all.   The enchilada was really amazing.  The sauce wasn't your average sauce - it had a nice kick.  The burrito was a joke.  I hardly ate any after the other two, but I had to at least try it after hearing such good things.  Very yummy - though I really want to try the bean burrito after all the great things said in prior reviews.    But that - will be next time.  And my friend and I have already talked about our next trip here.  Quick, inexpensive and good quality food.    Special note - When headed there don't forget that this is on 7th ave so you can't use the turn lane during rush hours.  Make sure you're headed the right way to make sure that isn't an issue!
4	yQUYg5k4uCTYfA6r7GHtg	I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it. I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn't eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good. It had the look, feel, and taste of bbq pork. I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte. I don't think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out!!
2	QtficVszxW2fD70N03gnQ	It seems like everyone had a better experience here than me. Maybe I just went on a bad day.  My biggest gripe about this place is that the veggies didn't look good. I had to pick through the carrots and tomatoes to find ones that looked relatively fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. Service was good though. Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
4	eQVy9ieohRrIVUbGVI7NOw	There are lots of other comments here in reviews that describe the Yard Dog. I've always enjoyed the food here (whether it's "authentic" or not). There for a while it was taking too long to be served to make this a lunch spot during work week. But lately, the service has been much faster. We've been able to get in and out in 45-50 minutes. I work nearby and with all of the restaurants in the area this one stays on the list. Get there early (e.g., 11:30) and you'll get a good seat. Wait much longer during the week and it will fill up. Shrimp and Grits are excellent.  I just wish they would bring back the biscuits.
4	neRay46mV3VTNVnBK20eXQ	My favorite bar in Charlotte, because of the atmosphere and the ping-pong tables outside.  Perfect for cool summer nights and really any season in Charlotte except for when its raining.  Decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular...like I said its the atmosphere of Thomas Street that makes it so cool, everyone is just there to chill, drink, meet up and have a good time.  The stadium seating near the ping-pong table adds to the unique attitude of this bar and when the competition heats up you can feel it throughput the lower part of the outdoor bar.  When the temperatures dip south they have fire pits in some of the outdoor tables as well as the traditional stand alone outdoor heaters. So come outside, drink a beer and gaze at the stars, and feel the vibe of Thomas Street; my favorite bar in Charlotte, it's unpretentious and straight -up chill so come kick it, if it isn't already ridiculously crowded...if it is... head up the street to P-Stone.
4	AYCBZoYzAD2J55mcwXtwfQ	My bf and I have been here a few times and we love their pizza. Its half price during HH and we always get pep & jalapeno and its always good. Its thin enough so you're not stuffed and its big. enough for 3 to share. My bf always orders draft beer  - great prices and I either get draft or order a mixed drink. Not too strong not too weak. They have pool tables and lots of bar seating. Its very chilled out and the bartender is always friendly. its been the same guy the last few times we've been. I'd def. go back to this place.
2	9y6v5Reoy031y5STvQSB8g	I was nervous about trying this place, but decided to give it a chance since it is so close to our house.  I walked in and the line was out the door, I took this as a good sign.  However, there were about 10 people ahead of me and I stood in line for about 30 minutes before I placed my order.  Once I placed my order I waited another 15 minutes for my food.  I order the brisket and pork. I ahve to say that there isn't any quality control at this place.  The meat was all mixed together and there were large amounts of chopped fat and bone mixed with the minimal portions of meat.  There was so much BBQ sauce that I couldn't taste the difference between the pork or the brisket, it was just sauce.  We also got the beans and mac and cheese for sides.  Blah Blah Blah, not impressed at all.  Still waiting for some quality food in the laveen area.  For the amount of time I had to wait I would have expected more, much more.  Next time I crave BBQ, I will drive the 40 minutes to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.
4	YX0CXFF58CAhkTPu6A5OsQ	Fenwick's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  It's tiny,  I mean there might be 4 tables and 6 booths in the entire restaurant, but the intimacy of this location is one of things that makes it special.  The other thing that make it special is the fillet sandwich, which is delicious.  I highly recommend the fried oysters as an appetizer, as well as the huge thick, onion rings.  The only down thing in my opinion is that they do not served iced tea...seriously your in Charlotte, this is the south, and we loooove some iced tea.  But other than  that this is a great restaurant with a very close and private vibe.  Fenwick's is located just on Providence road just past the Providence Queens intersection in the heart of Myers park.  If you're in Charlotte, do dinner at Fenwick's.
2	GJxfXDUfDhe0JzYI3b20A	All I can say is that you get what you pay for and that is not much here.  Food is very mediocre, doesn't taste fresh and is poorly presented.   The last few times we have been there we are the only customers for most of the time.  The staff just stands around doing nothing.
2	Nwsil7cgcarvXrqrz3Q	I live near this restaurant as well, and it is great for food during the day only... At night the service is very slow and the waiters can be cold shouldered. I went there a few times during fridays and saturdays late at night... the music is much too loud!! Also there was a group of loud drunk guys standing in front of the restaurant that made it seem unattractive to go in for food. Good food, but poor service...if you want to go make it a lunch outing.
2	O0zwe3SDWY0hUVVbevKXTw	Friends tell me this place is great, but my experience was only so-so. I went for a weekend breakfast a little while back, and wasn't all that excited about the service. The place was pretty crowded, which is ok, but the waiters did little to take care of this--it took forever for us to order, and even longer to get our good. AND though I ordered poached eggs with crab cakes, the dish came out without the eggs--which is pretty bad. The food was, however, pretty darn tasty, and with huge portions, which is how I like it.   There's nice outdoor patio (not that that matters in this weather) which is great when it's warm. It was very packed, though, so prepare to wait if you want to sit outside. Apparently it's a fun place to go to at night, too, but I can't speak to that...yet.
2	k96sz0GcSGcfmgVruiw	I should start out by saying that chicken wings are my favorite good, and bww is my favorite place to eat, but the service at this location is awful. They always mess up at least one thing, takeout is slow and since something is always wrong-your good ends up cold! The servers inside are just as bad! It took 15 minutes after being seated to just get our drink order taken! Plus, don't get me started on their ridiculous ranch and carrot policies. I'm sorry, but for 18 boneless wings-on a regular night-not boneless night, I should not have to pay for ranch and carrots! They need to get a grip on their customer service. I think some mystery diners or undercover boss help would wake the management of tips location up!
2	o6rc6s4gE4DAhWrvNISiA	Ok I'm in Montreal for a business trip with a co-worker and starving. We find a strip full of restuarants and it 7:00 pm. What the heck to do.  Boston Pizza in Montreal, what a oxymoron. The parking lot was crowded for a Tuesday night so it can't be all that bad.  I order a Black Angus certified 10 oz Sirloin with garlic toast, veggies and salad. 19.99 canadian. I order it medium rare thinking that it could be tough. It was allright but I needed a A1 sauce or something, what I received was this meatloaf sauce (the kind your mom made.....yucky). Veggies were soggy.  I think next time I will try the pizza. For lunch that is. Off to downtown for dinner...
2	0vxPxjH9VFolkqEBT1312w	Located in the downtown core on Parc Avenue.  Very busy street. As I entered the restaurant, we have the option of sushi shop and thai express jointed together. It was in the evening. The sushi was closed off but still some available pre-made to grab lol. I regret taking the pre made ones because they were Not Fresh at all! The rice was dried up and inedible. The food was really not good !! I came at around 10 but even the thai express was not good. I ordered a pad sew with beef.. The guy prepared it for me on the spot so It makes no sense that it tasted bad.. I mean the pad sew was very dry and hard and the beef was not fresh at all. I was very upset with the quality. Not only was the quality of food poor, the service waa bad as well. The lady was rude in her tone of voice. She was frank about not wanting to make me the miso soupe. she was not very pleasant and really has to get an attitude check!  Overall, I'm never coming back here again!
4	0IcB2UuWRXV4vxeHLkZ9w	Great food. Service is ok. My favorite is the camarones ala diabla and the camarones ala cucaracha! Good beer selection. Just beware of ur bill. They always seemed to add another 15-20 bucks on ur bill specially if u have been drinking. So they get 4stars.
2	KHtqHI7tCFhPBRyyAWVkFw	Great vibe and atmosphere, locally owned/operated, uses fair trade and (in most cases) organic ingredients - all wins.  However... as Julia noted, the service has dropped quite a bit as of late.  I was in this morning to purchase a single cup of coffee to go.  The person behind the counter didn't acknowledge my entry (there were 2 people in the place), and I honestly waited more than 10 minutes for her to complete everything else she was doing before she asked what she could get for me...   10 minutes may not seem like a long time, but when you swing-in while on your way to work, those ten minutes seem like an eternity.  Especially when it's for a $2 cup of to-go coffee... she could've rang-me-up and handed me a cup in a minute or less.    And, the cookies have gone downhill big time - hard and crispy rather than soft and chewy... ick.    Not sure if I'll be back - I can buy a whole pound of Just Coffee from Willy Street for $8, and if I have to wait 10 minutes for a single cup, I can spend that time brewing it at home just as easily...  Sorry, Tuvalu - it's "toot-a-loo" for me.  Best wishes.
4	AscxEVhGe2QDGwM5LOds0w	Some decent changes seem to be happening here - at least last night. Ordered the two-topping medium pan pizza special for $7.99 which turned out decent. Always a big fan of cheese sticks, so i decided to add the $5.99 stuffed sticks and these were clearly the highlight of the meal. You cut them yourself, but it ends up about six or seven slices of very cheesy bread. These are definetly guilty pleasures. Only negatives is that it will cost 75 cents for any dipping sauce for the bread (blue, marinara, etc) and they don't provide parmesan cheese packets. Everything was done online and arrived hot after about 25 minutes.
2	iuao8VvMVPyHPLtxaUvjNA	This 2 star review is  based on this particular location, not JITB in general.  I have recently moved near this Jack so it was probably my 3rd time visiting and before today I would of given this location a couple more stars perhaps, but definitely negative stars for my experience today. I have only been through the drive thru so I cannot comment on anything inside, but  the previous couple times have been your standard drive thru experience, nothing amazing, but nothing to gripe about until today.   There were 3 cars in line total including me when I ordered, so I would say it was not busy.  I asked the lady for a Big chicken sandwich combo (this was a request from my sister, I was actually going to 7-11 to get a drink next door, but figured I'd just get it there since they have 1.00 all size drinks now).  Anyway so I was asked what size and then I remembered she wanted no mayo so I asked for no mayo on the sandwich. Again I was asked what size, so I wasn't quite sure if she heard the request, but I thought I'd catch it on the readback, so I said small fry large coke (because of the 1.00 special).  After that the screen flashed 4.31 and that was it.  No readback, no pull up to the window, no asking if i wanted anything else ( I did). I sat there for at least 30 seconds waiting for something, but after it was clear nothing was coming I said, hello? and I was told to pull up to the window.  I asked the guy handing me my drink(a small drink btw) what her name was, and he started asking why I wanted to know. I told him because she was rude. He was nice enough to want to fix whatever was wrong but I was mad and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I did ask for him to make sure there was no mayo on the sandwich because it wasn't for me and at least I could have it right and I left. If the food was for me and not my sister I would of just drove on through hungry because I don't know if I've ever been that miffed in a drive thru.
2	WTlvAM3R9T2D0ZLQmBOA	Ranch House Grill gets a big fat "Meh" from me. I love breakfast joints and am always looking for new places to try. When I got a Groupon for Ranch House Grill I was hoping I would find a new place to add to our rotating list of breakfast hot spots. Not so much.  The boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday morning, there was a wait but nothing too long. I ordered the special - cinnamon raisin french toast, eggs and bacon. Boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet which he did say was pretty good. My food was okay but nothing special. The french toast was kinda small and didn't have a ton of flavor. Eggs were fine, bacon was okay. There was nothing bad about the food but there just wasn't anything great about it either. At least nothing to make me want to go back. Except maybe the Savers down the street - I found some great clothes there!
4	tqEFhK5bCF82BYSpoXWnUA	I love Providence Cafe and the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because they typically have a wait and aren't good about predicting how long it will be, and other people I have been with have disliked their food. Personally, I think the Chicken Salad Sandwich (served hot and open-faced on an english muffin with melted white cheddar and tomatoes) is one of the best in town, and the pesto pasta salad is yummy.  This said, I almost always get this so I don't know much about the rest of the menu.  Many others seem to feel like for the cost (moderate at lunch and the low end of pricey at dinner) and the amount of time you have to wait, the food isn't necessarily worth it.  I recommend that you go for yourself and decide.  Oh and this is the kind of place that always has groups of women there attending baby or wedding showers- I've been to two there myself.  EDIT:  I went here after my college graduation last week and we had a wonderful meal.  All seven of us ate something different, and we all enjoyed our food.  At least half the group got pasta, all of which were yummy.
4	oeV0GO2Gka9mGATd7G7Xw	We've eaten here many times. The turkey bialy is one of my favorites.  Most of the time the service is excellent.  Today we had a few issues with the preparation of the food, but when brought to the attention of the manager, he took the appropriate steps to make everything great.   This is a good, solid restaurant where you know that the quality of the food will be good.
4	noMpCOw6RnYuzzlQzB1eg	I haven't eaten here yet, but would give five stars for the view alone!  My dad and I went to the Duquesne Incline and then had some time to burn before his flight home, so we stopped next door at the Grandview Saloon for a beer and to hang out for a bit.  The patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.  I'm guessing there's more interesting food options in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd definitely stop here for the view again, especially with visitors.
2	YKU17bzP4BP0uPhuyyA8A	used to work here so i know how the service should be. ignoring calls and then answering just to hang up right away is NOT good service. aloha kitchen or paradise hawaiian bbq in tempe are better options.
4	5J8Fsg7PvUIW10gY2JlFpA	As Waffle House's go, and I've patronized a handful, this one is above the middle of the grade. The parking is sufficient for the number of seats inside (it's the standard size Waffle House) and the appearance from the outside is good. Inside, the floors and restrooms are clean. The grill area is well organized and stocked. Dirty dishes do not sit on the tables long. I'm somewhat sure this is a non-smoking Waffle House, because on my two visits here I have not been bothered by smoke.  Wait staff is attentive at taking orders promptly and calling them out to the cook staff. They are always around with coffee refills and brew fresh pots.  The food is what the food is at a Waffle House. Loads of grease and fat, tons of carbohydrates and, if it's your thing, excellent taste. The price is right, too. They're not looking to steal customers away from Ruth's Chris, nor would they succeed if they tried.  Open 24 hours, this Waffle House is very conveniently located right off I-77 where it meets I-485. Take the Westinghouse exit. Be careful getting back on the highway going north as I learned that it's easy to accidentally get onto the I-485 ramp instead of I-77. The traffic light getting back on to Westinghouse is an insanely long one - I ran it the first time after waiting nearly 10 minutes.  Would I visit this establishment again? You bet! Because sometimes in the middle of the night or the middle of the afternoon, you just want a delicious waffle. And because this one is better than others I have visited, it gets four stars.
4	U08Mu4AIsE29BF32XG5PA	Looking at the exterior alone, I wasn't so sure I wanted to go into Mike & Tony's but because of the high ratings on Yelp they pushed me in. When we walked in we were greeted with the pleasant smell of seasoned meat. The interior is a no frills, basic set up all in brown with some pictures and articles up; an arcade machine and a flat screen tv, playing espn. I instantly felt at home with the casual environment. Ordered the gyro platter and was amazed just at how cheap everything was for what we got. The meat was cooked and seasoned well and the tzatziki sauce was a thumbs up. Pita tasted fresh. Even though I ate everything off my plate and my stomach was stuffed to the max, my brain was telling me more. I know we will be back though Mike & Tony's is cash only.
4	LBFx80EUxVjzcEUgUQQPA	We travel to Scottsdale a couple of times a year and we always go to Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria for date night dinner.  The pizza is fabulous and the salads are awesome.  I was expecting it to be a bit over the top since it's in Old Town, but every time we go for dinner, it's great!
4	Sx0ap9eeJ854EUS1MOKaWg	I crave Conicella's.  It's a little hole-in-the-wall place, and there's not much of a menu, but oh man, the pizza is just terrific.  Tons of cheese, a fair amount of grease (hey, I never said I was a health nut), spicy pepperoni, delicious sauce and even decent crust, which I never seem to be able to find anywhere.  A large pizza will run you about $10 and will feed three hungry people.  Delivery is lightning-fast, or you can stop in and grab your pie.  There's nowhere to sit, and I'm not sure whether they take credit cards, but the pizza is totally worth a trip to the ATM across the street in any case.
2	IdzUk0D45JthhY69LVSFw	They need to work out the kinks, that's for sure.  Diablo's?  Pray to the devil that you get your food warm and you can see it.  1.  The lighting was SO low up top that they had to turn on the disco lights which were then blaring in our eyes. 2.  Food came out COLD.  No joke.  We had four plates of tacos and all were cold.  The fajitas were sizzling though. 3.  Salsa is excellent.  So good, I asked for a refill.  Um, ok, they charged me $6 for salsa refill.  EXCUSE ME?   4. Drinks were extra strong, but they should be for $10.  And they didn't have Ketel One.  That was a $10 Stoli. 5. Waitress was very sweet and trying really really hard. 6.  Bartenders downstairs (the girls) were absolutely clueless and it took two of them to figure out how to run a credit card--while 5 of us were still waiting to get served.  Thankfully the guy bartender was on the ball and stepped up to the plate.  He also flashed "Blue Steel."  That bartender deserves 5 stars. 7.  I finally complained at the end about the cold food and why were they charging me $6 for salsa when the food they brought out was sub par?  So the manager took off the salsa charge and the $8 chip charge as well.  Besides all that, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I think the downstairs was better.  The hostesses that I encountered were very nice and inquired about our party, what was it for, making small talk.  Overall though, like I said, they need to iron out the kinks.
4	jyqDFDJv2wMBBJZkMOG8vg	I've been eating their pizza since 1994 when it was called "Corliones"...  Their pies are great and the calzones are HUGE and amazing.  The neighborhood can be a little shady, but if you're at the Consol and are hungry, this is definitely the place to eat.  Now, if you just want a beer, head next door to Shales... Or, head to shales and bring your Milano's pizza... they don't mind a bit!
2	O0Zxa1yb1rUfhhkBGdhIPA	I don't often review McD, but after my experience with their drive-thru, I needed to say something.  I went here during afternoon rush hour on the way home from work.  Not only did I get a regular Dr. Pepper instead of the Diet Coke I ordered, but I realized why the drive thru was going so slow:  The exit line spills out onto southbound 7th Street as it crosses Van Buren.  During rush hour, this is a disaster.  So much traffic comes down 7th Street that you could find yourself waiting to exit the lot for five minutes or more--per car.  It might not take that much time for you, but it's the luck of the draw.  This is a more or less typical McD, situated in a lousy spot traffic-wise.  I'm not lovin' it.  Even if you get what you order, you'll have to wait forever to get it.  Nothing's fast about the food around 4:30 or 5:00pm if you're hoping to eat on the road.  Better to park, eat inside, and wait for the torrent of cars to die down a bit before heading home.
2	z3cDv66KajPtVJLAofPksQ	My friend lives down the street and I wanted to see what the Hochelaga Bourgeoisie eats, this is a fancy restaurant that's in a neighborhood full of hot dog, poutine and pizza joints.  The first thing I noticed is the size and layout, not traditional and must be gorgeous in the summer with terrace and park.   The waiter was very friendly and the service was good.  The food was hit and miss, I had the shrimp with sweet and sour sauce,($9 for three jumbo pieces). Amazing, except for the sauce, but no big deal  My friend had the Calamari, which is not fried, so a bit disappointing as the long winded description did not say if it was grilled, fried, or something between boiled and zapped.  Onto the mains, my friend had the salmon, which was ok,  I had the rib steak ($29), big letdown, it was grey to begin with and lacked flavor, texture, I had to force myself to finish it.  The desserts were very good, I had the cronut with maple ice cream ($8)  I must include this in my review by mentioning i got a little bit sick after my meal, It was the only mealy I had after waking up and did not eat for many hours afterwards. I hope it's a one off and not something that happens too often.  I would go back to try other stuff as they have a cheaper nighttime menu for $20, which is a bargain, might raise my rating a bit.
4	LOlBfuYu3pJCculzN7OKAA	My co-worker and I had a great lunch at the Steelhead today.  I got the Light & Simple 1/2 Turkey BLT and 1/2 Garden Vegetable Salad meal.  The Turkey BLT was excellent.  The turkey was fresh and plentiful.  The bacon was perfect and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  My 1/2 garden vegetable salad was very good.  The Champagne Vinaigrette dressing was perfect.  I highly recommend trying this place if you are in Downtown Pittsburgh.  The only thing is that they are a little pricey.
2	0gkkbyFmqUGU7yrpp8rTRg	I know, I know.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is all into Pamela's breakfast.  But I just don't get it.  I don't like my pancakes crepe thin and extra greasy.  And I really don't like the crispy, crunchy edges.  That's pretty nasty to me.  And the lyonnaise potatoes, while good, are just potatoes.  My friend had an omelet that looked pretty good.  And I'll admit, I stole half a slice of his toast.  I'll probably go back, because it's a good location and the service and decor were both good.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep waiting to go back or craving this stuff.....
4	oVs6iRCHoVw3mwqVfdU8A	I used to go by Chick-Fil-A every morning when I was in high school for a chicken biscuit, but I'm older and not as active and that would be crazy...delishious as hell but not smart and expensive.  So I keep it simple.  Like any other hard working American and I don't feel like cooking I look for faster choices.  Usually I order the plain combo and top it off with some BBQ Chick-Fil-A sauce, the Chicken Salad Sandwich (it's pretty good), or my favoirte the Chicken Strip Salad.  Anywone who has been with me when I have ordered this salad knows it takes me about 10 minutes to prepare the salad by evenly distributing the carrots, cheese, and broccoli around the salad.  Then I have to cut up the chicken strips put the sunflower seeds all over (not too many in one place) and lastly the croutons.  I use two different types of dressing.  Either a Honey Mustard or Ranch with Spicey. I put half of each packet on and then dive in (this way once I eat the first top layer I still have enough for the second).  I know this is a little OCD but it truly does make the salad simply delish!  If you read this then try it and tell me thank you for helping you discover how to make a good salad...perfect :)
4	kPLNpf0NeloTd7gBKqlVyg	As always this Carraba's always aim's to please and this last trip was no different. Great food, great atmosphere, and great Service. A winning combination. Now if they would just get "Red Oak" on tap. That might change my mind to 5 stars.
4	I6PtdUvbElGAgPABKanug	Honestly I've never eaten anything here other than spring rolls, pho, and occasional sips of my girlfriend's vegetable soup.  And that is ok, because I loves me some pho.  Pho pho pho.  Best with extra srirachi and chili slices so my eyes water and nose runs.  To the uninitiated: order the spring rolls and pick a pho (and you may want to steer clear of the tripe & tendon on your first try just in case), have a beer if you like, and go to town.
4	BBiqkkHpYsgyJAa4z4oW2Q	This place isn't THE best but it never disappoints me. It's conveniently located right next to my place of work and it's easy to come and grab some food. The take out service is very fast and I rarely wait more than 10-15 minutes. It never seems busy during the lunch hours but it seems to get packed later in the evening. Their lunch specials look good and reasonable for the price but I always just go straight for their pad thai with tofu. So yummy! I usually order a "7" on their scale of spicy-ness and it satisfies me to no end. The people who work here are very nice. One day I went in there to order some lunch and they were setting up some sort of party. They asked me to try some of the food they were setting out, for free! Well don't mind if I do. I have no idea what I tried but it was darn good.  Also, looks like this place does Karaoke and it's open late...as in 5 or 6 AM late.
2	lCLf1zgIcct5GfQgRxKvfA	Oops. This review is pretty late. I came here with my family for New Year's Eve! I was excited to try a steakhouse in the West Valley, in hopes of having a steak option close to home. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I'll be going back. The filets my family had were dry, tough and salty. It probably didn't help that we had dined at Mastro's for Christmas Eve (amazing!) so I think our expectations may have been on the high side. My dad ordered the lobster tail, which was small and also dry and tough. The cheese in the French Onion Soup was not fully melted, and there was A LOT of cheese. For dessert we got Creme Brulee. It was the highlight of the meal for me since I have a huge sweet tooth, but not enough for me to want to go back to Fleming's any time soon. I will say, that though the food was subpar, the service was great.   **If you do decide to go here, check out Costco for discounted $100 gift certificates!
2	NahP4Un146gRcpfDhfZg	I keep trying new taco places in Henderson/LV but they keep disappointing me! I don't know why i keep wanting to explore when I've already found a place that I love! (Taco y Taco)  I was craving a fish taco and put that into Yelp. Most of the results were Rubio's - which I totally would have been okay with because I wanted a crispy taco! But we decided to try out Las Famosas de Jose.  FOOD: I got a fish taco and an al pastor burrito. My eating buddy got a Ferdo 3 lb burrito. Our total was about $25 which means the giant 3 lb burrito was about $15! Yikes.  The fish taco was soooo disappointing!! Grilled and the fish was in cubes. Very little flavor, I dumped a bunch of salsa on it. The al pastor burrito was better but it was mostly meat and I prefer a little more balance in my burritos. It also started falling apart when I ate it because they wrapped it in paper and not foil. The 3 lb burrito is HUGE, cut in half - each half was the size of my regular burrito. I had a bite and liked it! Just not for the price.  Salsa bar was ooook. Not too many spicy options and no cilantro/onion!  The workers were very nice though - I asked for a piece of foil to wrap up the remainder of my my burrito and a plastic bag to carry everything. I asked for a water cup but they said they were out of the small cups and couldn't give one to me. What??? Never heard that excuse before.  VENUE: No frills place. You order at the counter and pick up your food there. They have forks, spoons and knives available for you and you can leave your tray on the table once you're finished. NO bathroom, but there's a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall.  Location is a bit sketch so keep your eye out at night!
2	VInbwqP7xBiP52YJ5soyHw	I used to have this place as 5 stars, but I have to call them out.  Before, "all you can eat" meant all you can eat.  But here, they put limits on one order of mussels per person, one order of salmon eggs per person, etc. even though you PAY for all you can eat.  I used to love their sushi and the service is still good, but I would like to get what I pay for, especially since we have gone there over a dozen times.
4	XUVduXLNKK5FOgoRWgw4w	How does one ever choose which Vietnamese restaurant to go to when they are everywhere and their names are only differentiated by a number?  Because someone else must bring you there first, and that brings me to Pho Saigon 8.  A packed place on Saturday afternoon, a bit of a wait for our party of 7.  It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)  I had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.    Like all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.    Overall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  Update: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.  Update! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.  Another friend was really impressed that they offered red rice too since she rarely sees that on the menu.  I'll up their rating from a 3 to a 3.5.  (I added pics of our eating in the business profile this time!)
4	btW0uLVwyMuRG1ndxAWA	I didn't know what Jason's Deli was all about until a year ago.  Now it's always the place to go when looking for a great salad or some hot food.  My office gets a lot of their box lunches which make our seminars and meetings pretty fun and tasty.  It's a little hard getting in and our of the parking lot since Harris has those large islands - gotta make a U-turn to get back to the direction you want to go, but it's a small sacrifice compared to the salad and food offered here.  Free ice cream too!
2	R9E8fgMgSKeRSCE2vlkGA	I am very disappointed after reading the great reviews and going to that place. As a Mexican taking my Colombian grandma along to eat there, we were expecting to eat authentic food with Latin American flavors but the only thing authentic in my view is Don Julio, the cooks and the tv programs. We ordered the Paisa platter, some empanadas,  chicharron along with some fruit juices. The food was terribly simple, with no real taste and expensive for what we got.  I was expecting fresh fruit juice but it was made from a (cheap) concentrate pulp sold at latin markets for a very expensive price. I don't give one star because Don Julio seemed to be a nice person but for sure I won't come back there anymore.
4	s1ccHV0eR1WZ49mqW9fWcw	I agree pretty much with the other reviewers that the burgers are fantastic.  I happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years I've been hangin in the s. side I never stopped prior.  The space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  The only one complaint that I have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when I first walked in.  I was greeted warmly by one of the servers "Li Li" I believe.  She was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  The bartender was "Bear".  He was a good typical burgh' bartender.  He served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  I ordered the "ultimate burger" which I ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  Incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as I witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  The soup was forgettable.  The broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  It really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  Incidentally, I had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like I lucked out with the order.  The burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  The burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  It very much reminded me of a Tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but I can't bring myself to say it).  The staff was so friendly I found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  I will go again and stick to the burgers.  The rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again I think the burger is the star.  Incidentally, I was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity.
2	QmOosbXEWRZZ7pSLnFPQ	My friend had some comp coupons for the buffet, so we went at breakfast time one day. It had your typical buffet fare (a little of everything) and was rather greasy and salty. The waitresses are ancient...as my friend put it, "I think they dug her up to cover a shift for someone!" Most buffet-goers were HUGE and had two or three plates piled up in their pudgy arms. (This is a BUFFET folks, they're not running out of food anytime soon! I don't think even the recession can hit this place) I would go here again if I had a comp coupon, but otherwise I'd skip it.
2	NDkZMfMh5qnosy61SfVKBA	Last night I was feeling lazy so my boyfriend and I decided to order from Rice Box - we'd heard good things from a friend and who can resist a cheeky Chinese carryout?  Now I wish I'd just cooked instead as the food was really disappointing.  Boyfriend thought his chicken satay and noodles were fine, but I barely touched my 'deep-fried shredded beef with chilli' and fried rice.  Shredded beef is one of those standard Chinese takeaway dishes, you'd have thought it'd be hard to do wrong but it turns out it is. The beef itself was chewy, and rather than being nice and crispy the batter was soggy - the chilli sauce itself is marketed as 'spicy' but isn't remotely. The fried rice wasn't great either - not awful, I ate most of it, but the rice itself was slightly undercooked. As a side note too, whilst I appreciate that they offer online ordering through their website, I didn't find it to be hugely user-friendly and signing up to a website such as Just Eat would probably be a better idea. Safe to say we won't be ordering from here again!
4	cBCgfz7PGY5M826DZ6M8A	Sure the place wasn't very modern or the table or chairs in perfect condition but this place had decent food.  Everything was very fresh and cooked perfectly.  I had a coupon so I decided to try it.  I'm glad I did.  I've been looking for a decent Chinese place and this is it.  I think it's the best so far in N. Phx.  I tried a bit of everything and nothing tasted bad or was cooked bad..  I will definitely go again.  It beats most Chinese places in this area hands down.
2	my3a8VzltyI6R8ZWGJAdQ	Ok, if Subway is busy. Just too darn expensive for pitas!  I've been here a total of three times now, and each time I came away feeling like $8 (pita and a drink + tax) is too much for what you get. Yesterday was my last trip here. I had a babaganoush and my son had a hummus. There was NO WAY they spread more than 1.5oz. on each. Plus, the babaganoush had no distinguishing flavors of eggplant nor garlic, requirements of a good babaganoush. My 8yo son was starving after eating his hummus pita and asked for another. We decided to pickup some 'filler' at Subway.  On the up side, everything is fresh and the have a moderately good selection of sauces and extras.  If you do decide to go, go for some meat. At least you have a better chance of filling that growing tummy.
2	v6hI7YOSIjI0HJ15fC15oA	I thought I finally had found a decent Mexican restaurant in my new neighborhood but this place is seriously bland and makes me miss Mexican food in the mission.   I tried the super burrito and my man had the soft tacos both were so mild with no real flavor.   Maybe I'll try something else soon but for now Los Burritos, 2 stars.
2	Qiaiql6sy4kdxZOtYvHrLQ	Had to rush the order for lunch.  I picked the Chicken wrap, it was such an easy item to make, but they managed to find a way to do so.  They drenched it with dressing which made the sandwich soggy.  It's in the Mandalay Bay, so the price had to be expensive, and it was.  I could not complain about the service, it was very good.
2	UTIBNJW6tEblYwxB5i25oA	I'm so disappointed the the service I received at this location this morning. I usually come here multiple times a week for lunch and am always satisfied but today I came for breakfast instead. I pulled up right before 10:30am and ordered my breakfast item. Pull up to the window 5 mins later to be told that they ran out of the item I ordered. Now, because it's after 10:30, they don't have any other breakfast items besides a burrito and bacon egg and cheese sandwich. I came to chick fil a for chicken not bacon. I told the girl at the window that neither of those items would work for me and she said "Sorry".. Didn't offer me a coupon or anything for my breakfast tomorrow. I'm extremely upset with the way this was handled. And now because it's after 10:30 I can't even go to another location to get my breakfast! So annoying!!
2	HmKWMD4MKwlrRQOJvZwr3A	I went to the Le Peep in Orlando once for brunch in the early 2000s.  I was amazed by the 80s country decor with hunter green tones.  (Note: sarcasm.)  After moving to Charlotte and not aware yet of any brunch places, we decided to give the Le Peep here a try.  Wow--same thing.  It's like every Le Peep was built in the 80s and hasn't changed a thing since.  Their menu items for brunch are pretty good, but the atmosphere kills it for me.  You'd do better going to Good Ol' Days just on the other side of the Arboretum shopping plaza.  1950s decor = cool.  1980s decor = uncool.  But maybe if they wait around a couple more decades they'll be considered "retro."  Who knows?  For me, now that I've discovered them, there are much better brunch options in Charlotte.
2	znQBjk4N2pB6C5cso8tqQ	Qdoba started out fairly well but has gone downhill in our opinion. The portions are unpredictable and more often small. I would like more information about where their beef and chicken comes from. The meat is usually cold. The people behind the counter are distant and uninterested in me being there.  I would just like a smile and some friendliness.   They probably need to pay a little bit more and nurture some happy employees. The atmosphere is cold and uninviting while the view at this place isn't half bad. It is very clean so they get a good mark there. We stopped going here and opting for locations that have hot food, larger servings, nicer environment and friendlier people.
4	hizKh8hmYyYFqjCNiBh1Hg	This place is 3 stores in one, a restaurant, a bakery and a meat market.  I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars, the bakery 4 stars and meat market 5+stars.  I've only eaten at the restaurant once; my Mom and her husband love this place - so on her recommendation a couple friends and I went for a prime rib dinner.  My friends and I are not young, but we were the youngest people there.  No problem, it was 8pm and we were starving.  We each ordered the prime rib dinner which came with soup, potato and a dessert.  The soup was some sort of cream soup that was so gelatinous the spoon stood straight up in the sticky glop, yuck!  Thank God the prime rib was brought out quickly, it was FANTASTIC!  Medium rare, tender, tasty in it's own juice.  Delicious!  It's a good thing we weren't hungry for dessert, it was some sort of pudding that had the same gelatinous appearance as the soup earlier.  Gross.  I've only stopped through the bakery once for some cookies.  Everything is made fresh daily and they'll take special requests for anything including sugar free and low fat items.    Go here for the meat.  I won't even buy grocery store beef since shopping here.  They'll cut anything and everything to your preferences and needs.  They are so helpful and friendly and the best part is the quality of the beef.  Everything is well marbled, fresh and fresh cut and it tastes 100 times better than anything I've bought in a grocery store.  Prices are beyond reasonable especially considering the level of service they provide.    Between this place and the Superstition Ranch Market down the street, I rarely have to shop at a grocery store.
4	6sfLWeX7PWd8XWROJJlkQ	I am salivating as I think about Sacks - sits on ASU campus - off Mill and the visitor parking lot behind COOR. During the semester it is PACKED for lunch. But they are pretty good about moving through the line. The sandwich options are many, the quality of ingredients is excellent and you get a cookie with every 'wich.   There's a Subway across the street, but if you are in the mood for a REAL sandwich with exceptional quality this is your place. I recommend the Veggie - one of the best versions of this I have ever had. (Average sandwich, plus drink and side will run $9-12)
4	R20zhsUJG9RPBWOFE9hvw	Great outdoor seating.  The interior was definitely someone's residence at some point.  Plenty of TVs for games.  The heat lamps outside and bar outside was key.  Beer selection was average, and we didn't have any of the food.  Overall an excellent time at the selwyn pub
4	kiTUWQExinFmF5eVf0L31A	UPDATE:  I still order the patty melt veggie style but not long ago, I dragged a friend here to check out breakfast.  YUM! Check out the pic I posted of the VEGGIE BREAKFAST BURRITO. It was wonderful. As usual, courteous, efficient service.
2	mwWD5kwPdtsWSXuJvAaoEw	After reading a few reviews and desperately searching for the One Pizza To Rule Them All here in AZ, I decided it was time to try Sauce (also, I didn't want to study any more).  I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but Sauce wasn't it.  It was good.  Not great, but decent.  The food was fresh and hot.  It tasted fine, I just wasn't really thrilled by it.  I just felt like I could have ordered a pizza from the school cafeteria and would have gotten only slightly less quality (and no wine).  Oh, and the wine servings are very tiny.  Not a way to earn fans.
2	3CwqVpDfgZcH3qtyNh16EA	I love the idea pizza and empanadas, two of the best foods ever. However, the empanadas weren't so good. In one word; soggy. I like my empanadas freshly fried, little bundles of goodness wrapped in a crispy shell of deliciousness. I should have known when the nadas were sitting in a display case under a heat lamp.  You get 2 instead of 1, because the guys working there were nice. If I get hungry I might try the pizza and reevaluate.
2	G1qOqd1CvhOVrB60vXOXvg	What sounded like a promising and even delicious burger, the Buffalo Ranch, arrived at my table as a total disappointment. To start with, the "seasoned" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were "seasoned" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).  At least the server Brandon was a nice guy and he offered to remove the burger from my check. For this, and the fact that the place serves beer and has sports on tv, Fox gets two stars.
4	Ps559xQaEilNCMShbYjUw	Pin Kaow doesn't disappoint. The food is good and the service is speedy and attentive. The interior is cool and they keep it ethnic. The food is good. Chicken Pad Thai was tasty as was the Red Curry. There spicy / hotness is actually flavorsome. My GF usually can't hang with a 2 on the Thai hot scale she can hang with a 4 here. Not because it's off but there's a flavor to it.
4	h7t2l3tSl1XGaUtPIuhQ	When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?  I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?
4	wwZIldqiAK8tcI1IYxmfg	Ok we are returning here slowly each time. We stopped coming here for awhile because the food was not up to par. I can say that this has changed! YES! I don't know if they have a new cook or management has stepped up but the food has never been better. Welcome back neighbor!
4	bbzTRQIN90q5E8B9o8ADA	As a Cantonese who lives in Los Angeles (one of the biggest China towns in the world) for over 10 years, I am pretty sure that I am qualified for rating a Chinese buffet restaurant in Phoenix area.  The only plus thing I have to give to them is they serve Cantonese style hot pot, which you put the raw meat and vegetable inside by yourself and you can choose whatever sauce you want to dip for your food. It causes extra 3 dollars (I forgot) for hot pot but you can also get the all you can eat buffet too.
4	ULc7b3UBOhUuT8311XFA	I don't know why I don't come here more!! The food is always good and the service is excellent!!   Came in Yesterday for lunch and had the soup of the day which was the broccoli cheddar, soo good!! I had a BLT that was made on homemade white bread and was served with hand-cut french fries soooo good and filling!! My boss and sister both got the Chicken Fantastic they also really enjoyed they'res!!
4	wpjcfVelLqKUoR7CM81Bg	On our way to an A's game at Phoenix Municipal Stadium, we were on a hunt for breakfast. Our pre-yelped stops were way off the beaten path and we wanted to get to the stadium somewhat early. We found this place in the shopping plaza somewhat nearby. We were quite suprised to find that the place was packed!!! With a line! and a great smelling bagel smell filling the room. We were quite happy to find that there were bagel sandwiches with eggs and there were even wraps. We both ordered bagel sandwiches with turkey sausage and egg and cheese. We opted for different bagels. The bagels were warm soft and fresh. SOOOO YUMMY!!! I would highly recommend. The prices are a bit up there if you are looking for just a quickie breakfast, but way better than fast food.   Check it out.
4	Yy26IAloRb9DypMO3QJzwQ	I do understand other reviewers that they don't have much of a menu, I have to say that their Supreme Quesadilla is good!   I also recommend their chicken rolled tacos, they are flour, crispy and come with guacamole, for the price you pay , come on people... this is no steak house!  So on average I would say MUCH BETTER than Filiberto's across the way!.
4	N5wz6U62bpTvCOdRHA3gQ	I was surprised to find out that this was a super casual place to eat. One of those places where you order at the front, grab a number, find a spare table, and wait as the servers find you and bring your food. Bottomless coffee is self serve.   The blueberry pancakes are really fluffy and eggy. The batter itself isn't sweet and the stack of three is topped with powdered sugar and rolled oats. Yum. The oats really do it for me. Is this is Midwest thing or have all the gazillion breakfast places I've been to on the West Coast just happen to not to that?   We also got an egg white omelet with artichokes, topped with a smidge of asiago. The marigold potatoes on the side were good but like most other patrons, we barely finished. I also appreciated how lightly they added vinaigrette dressing to the side salad.   I wish this place was cleaner. And the bussers faster. We had to flag down a busy busser/server to wipe our table. Atmosphere was your standard organic-feeling breakfast place but nothing stood out. I liked Cafe Soleil's setup better.
4	dB3toid1VkWWpsrDhDj6w	Good food and very reasonable prices.  I know and like good Mexican food and recommend this place.  They serve good Margaritas also.  The food was taste and well seasoned.  Forget the atmosphere, go for the food.
2	zkheU1ghtPsVGj2hFPJ9Ow	The ABSOLUTE worst McDonald's on the planet! PERIOD! The only reason why I didn't give them a 1 star is because Mcdonald's food is great!  The service at this particular restaurant is by far the suckiest form of service known to man. My 4 year old niece delivers food to me in a more respectable way. After waiting in line for 45 mins to order, you have to wait another 45 mins to get your food. The only thing I can imagine playing in my head while watching how the workers go about their duties could be circus theme music.   We were talking to people around us while we stood in amazement on how bad the service was. One lady waited 30 mins for coffee, not leaving just to see how long it would actually take for her coffee to come. After the second time she asked for her coffee, the manager herself had the audacity to give her attitude.   As a continuing supportive customer to the Mcdonald's brand, I strongly suggest that you send people there to teach them how to run their lines. The people their obviously do not know what they are doing!
4	ZRQypTm8Wtw9HmIWvEXmg	Located inside the very beautiful Hermosa Inn, this place has the most amazing location. Sitting outdoors gives a beautiful view of the mountains or if you are dining inside, you get the feel of the house of Lon , complete with a library, wine cellar and dining area. Went with a friend for a Sunday lunch and was greeted by a very cordial staff. Had mimosa which was very refreshing. I had the salmon and my friend had a chooped salad. Both were great. Tried the Mexican tiramisu for dessert that had a very nice presentation.  A very good place to take a date or hang out with girlfirends . We couldnt sit outside as it was cloudy today but would love to go back and do that.
2	dqqSUfdHtuXrWJJYcRPcQg	Seriously!?  I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why this place is rated so high.  AND.  Reviews actually say the best around?  Then you don't get out much.  Listen.  It isn't horrible.  But it is certainly the Denny's of sushi joints.  Service was friendly.  Sesame seaweed was a perk because no one seems to serve it anymore.  Veggie tempura was dripping grease.  And.  There are five thousand different sushi rolls that all sound and taste the same!  We had soft shell crab roll, shrimp with eel, and spicy tuna with cilantro.  The cilantro was a GREAT addition, but the tuna was fishy and strangely colored.  Soft shell crab wasn't terrible, shrimp and eel was really fishy.  I do not believe the Rolls were rolled correctly as they just fell apart. I'm sorry, but I was unimpressed, and we won't be returning.  Again, super friendly people, and neighborhood joint atmosphere cannot make up for food, in my opinion.
2	mfUjt60mdbQZ4CDIBQAEaQ	this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.
2	qusBKIYU4yCt06JjqDRl4Q	I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.    Food is normal, wait is not.
4	lXlX74eONDpfMWpVWZJOaA	This is such a great place to go when you are sick of all of the places to eat on campus.  I think I loved this place from the moment I walked in and saw that they use the same chairs that my parent's have around their kitchen table.  The atmosphere is very homey.  So the food...  Obviously the shakes are amazing, but so are their sandwiches.  My favorite is the grilled swiss and pesto on sour dough with sweet potato fries.  They also have a big salad bar in the back and you pay for your salad by weight.  They have pretty interesting combinations and the price is just right.
4	CPyre4QpkpJtunsCoJHgZA	When we were getting ready for our trip to Arizona I got on Yelp to stake out the best Sushi places in the area. Kyoto seemed to have some of the best reviews, so we decided to check it out. We got there just in time, they close at 2pm for lunch and open back up for dinner later in the day.  The salmon was fantastic. The unagi was fantastic. the rolls were nothing spectacular, in fact, a little dry. But, all in all, a quality sushi place. The prices were reasonable, about what you'd expect to pay for decent sushi. What I want to know is this: Is there a good "all-you-can-eat" sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs?
4	crEHe9BRwpu5j3H57vdgg	I like coming in for a quick bite here.  The beef soba and the sushi fish of the day are always good and fast.  The soba comes in a large bowl filled with cabbage, meat, onions, soba noodles, and other veggies.  Not super spicy, I will usually add a little chili spice to it; which they bring to the table too.  The hot green tea is very tasty and warms up the body after a cool walk on State Street (it also seems to never stop coming either.)  Typically I usually am in and out within 30-45 minutes.  Ask the sushi chef about the fish of the day, servers don't usually know.  Super Cali roll and spicy hamachi roll (must ask for this special) are super yummy!  Normally busy between 5-7 pm, I go before or after the college kid rush but they are open until 10 pm.
4	QyxUsGQbHXSaCiG6Kcx49g	An appointment brought me to this side of town this morning.  When the java craving kicked in, the yelp app pointed me to the Coffee Pub.  The waitress greeted me by asking if I would like to dine in or carry out.  I was only wanting coffee, so I did carry out.    Upon her suggestion, I tried a mocha/hazelnut latte.  Yummy with fast, friendly service.  It didn't have that cozy coffee house atmosphere, but definitely a solid spot to grab a cup of joe.
4	fOx0TejXQ257krFzm6eLtw	My husband and I have been coming here for about 7 years.  The food is always great, and we love their .99 margaritas on Mondays.  The staff is also very friendly.  The atmosphere is great, and we always bring our out-of-town guests here, for some good authentic Mexican food you can't find other places!  They've opened a second location in Surprise, but I'm in agreement with many other Yelpers in saying that this original location is much better!
2	antCbXNnnsE9rqeU7wg	If there's one thing old Jimbo is good at, it's milking the cash cow. He's certainly not good at making top quality Chinese food.  I've been quite harsh on a number of Chinese buffet restaurants throughout my Yelp scouting, and with good reason. They're all awful, and use the age-old trick of loading the food with a number of stomach filling additives to ensure that you'll be reaching for the sick bag a few mouthfuls in.  If however you still want to hand over you're \u00a312.99 to honest Jim, then please be aware that you will need to visit the toilet with a great degree of urgency immediately after your meal. It will hurt and it will stink, but it's the price you pay.
4	vph3sreoJKr1MBlQRfoLg	Cheap chinese buffets are my favorite type of "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives" to seek out and enjoy; a little bit of risk can sometimes bring a great reward. Other times..., well, it's a gamble that either pays off or it doesn't -- hopefully you don't pay too dearly!   China Harvest is one of the good finds, but it takes a very specific taste (ie cheap) to fully enjoy a dining experience there. The restaurant is housed in a former Denny's restaurant building, in a Food City shopping center at 28th Ave and Cactus in North Phoenix, and with its sloping, tiled roof, really looks like an old chinese building. They added a bright green, almost chartreuse, interior paint-job and stuck compact fluorescent light bulbs in all of the booth's fixtures to spruce up the place and make it their own, creating quite a trailer-chic ambiance.   China Harvest has been in this location for a long time, and is almost always moderately busy. It seems to be a family-run operation, since the same workers are always there whether I go for a late dinner or an early weekday lunch (insert Labor Law joke here). In several years of coming here, I've never gotten personal with the staff, but they are always polite, recognize me as a regular customer, and are even occasionally cheerful, if reserved. Cleanliness is okay, but the place is OLD, so maintains a pretty dumpy facade.   If you can get past the decor, China Harvest does make some pretty good 'american-style' chinese food. All of the staples are there, such as S&S chicken, fried rice, noodles, egg rolls, etc. They also include some items that are not always found, but that I appreciate, such as spinach, bean sprouts, and other veggies. I am not a seafood fan, but they always have plenty of choices, from stuffed crab to shrimp to mussels, which my wife and daughter enjoy a lot. I've even seen folks 'sucking the heads' of a pile of crayfish. I usually stick with the several varieties of chicken dishes, such as spicy General Tso's, sweet honey-sesame, or teriyaki chicken, and the BBQ pork as well. There are plenty of generic dessert choices to choose from including soft serve ice cream, fruit, cakes, and there's always room for Jello.   My only concerns are that a lot of the dishes are cooked using a deep fryer, and sometimes the temperature or draining must not be quite right and the items are a little on the wrong side of the GREASY-CRISPY Spectrum. On those days, the food quality combined with the environment would only warrant about 2.5 stars. If this could be remedied to at least be consistent, or better yet if there were more dishes prepared by grilling, woking, or baking, I would enjoy the food even more.  Also, there are no toppings available for the ice cream, just a standard soft serve machine with VAN - SWIRL - CHOC and a choice of a dish or a cone. I get around this by adding some of the bananas with fake strawberry sauce from the salad area of the buffet, but some chocolate syrup and nuts would be even better.   A nice choice for lunch is to take advantage of paying by the pound to get it to go. You get to load up however much you like and pay for that much -- lunch to go for me is usually around $3-5, which can save over the All-You-Can-Eat price if you don't have a big appetite that day. I don't like this on days when I want a ton of food, though; then it's better to go to a one-price per box place.   China Harvest may only be a 3 star joint to most folks, but it is right up my alley as a low cost, decent quality, cheapo china 'booofay'.
4	0tlIr7tPP5INU0ZRy0YDg	After driving by this place almost everyday I decided I would try there breakfast. I was pleasantly surprise! I had the breakfast platter which contains scrambled eggs, a biscuit, hash brown sticks, and sausage. Very well done WHATABURGER! There apple pie wasn't bad either! I would recommend it to everyone!   As for the location yea it's questionable and maybe not too safe at night but hey I went at 8am so it was all good! Lol
2	oxT9go6spI1kwM94lTBQ	I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...  REVIEW Uninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.  Fish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:  Fish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk.   Anatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop.   Tots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Ol\u00e9 for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.  I want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream "short-term, dabbling in the industry business model".  Will update after another visit. Maybe.

The $1 strawberry lemonade is excellent -- it contains actual frozen strawberries in their defrosted form -- and I don't regret trying the bacon mini-quesadilla because bacon. I appreciate that Del Taco has salsa verde.  I don't appreciate waiting 10 minutes for a $2 order, only to discover it had been never been started. The dude in charge hated his life and wasn't trying to hide it. The dude on the line appeared terrified into utter confusion. I understand that the smiles at McDonald's are merely masks for tormented  and oppressed souls, but I appreciate the effort to fake it, y'know?  The combination of $1 menu, strawberry lemonade, and prime location means I probably will eat here again, but I'm not proud of this.
4	ffSZKwvGuW3hkuGQ98HejA	The California breakfast burrito was a perfect combination of pico potato cheese and steak. Perfect for a hangover. I will not order the carne Asada taco salad again because it was extremely salty. I think it's because I got carne Asada though so I may try a taco bowl again but get steak or chicken instead. Then if all that fails I will just go for the breakfast burrito. I just love all the toppings on the tAco salad, it has just a little bit of everything in a fried taco bowl shell. I will be back here!
4	6YHncA6s58oVohFOqlldg	I went here for their Mother's Day Brunch last year May 2009 and it was great. There scones were the best I've ever had. With them, they brought lemon curd, an apple spread, and devonshire cream. The lemon curd was to die for. They were white chocolate and fabulous. They brought us out a 3 tiered platter that had little sandwiches, scones, and desserts on it. We also had a salad appetizer that had strawberries in it, I was skeptical, as I do not eat fruit in regular salad. It was very good. The tea was delicious peach, not from a tea bag. The china we ate off of and drank from was beautiful and delicate. The place is a tea room after all, so it has cottage, country style decor with lots of trinkets, most of which are for sale. I loved it. We had great, personal service and a memorable experience.
2	AQ32iXhGOrPDpgivlDCqw	After having already tried Viva Mexico once, we thought we would be adventurous and try Pancho Villas, but we came away disappointed. This place has a great location and, as such, is usually busy. However, that is because it is touristy and looks inviting, but the food betrays it and is quite basic and not authentic Mexican at all. To top it off, the staff is unfriendly and even at times disdaining.
4	7ARDgwkF76v2C7AFRW3kw	I Have eaten here about 3 times for dinner and once for breakfast.  The breakfast was a 4 star experience because of one thing, bangers, Scottish Bangers.  If you don't know what that is, it is a sausage link that is savory and about 6 inches in length.  The rest of the breakfast is well executed as well.  The Big breakfast was better than any chain place that specializes in breakfast I mean you IHOP.  BTW under beverages you can get hot cider too.  If you live in the GVR or Anthem area this is a great little quiet breakfast spot not like the others.   As for dinners, they make a good burger but not quite as good as BJ's brew house down the hill on Eastern.  The pasta dishes are good.  I had the eggplant which using an A-F scale I would give a B-.  But Truly great Italian can be hit or miss in the Valley.  The calamari appetizer was a little greasy, again BJ's are better.  Overall though this place is solid and you can tell by the families that show up.  The owner is usually lurking about and she is dressed like the help.  She is blonde and about 5'3' with a very appealing smile.
2	8AqevjoO3KGkAY6fmv26w	I'm not normally so hard on the Royal Mile pubs. Yes they are nearly all marketed with some collage of Scottish themes to pull people in, trap them, then take all their money, but ironically they often end up being a lot more welcoming than a lot of the local pubs in Edinburgh.  But I felt WHISKI was verging on the exploitative. Okay so nothing was that bad. The food is alright and they have a good selection of whisky (I agree with Kate about the whisky cider). But the prices were just too much. I resent having to pay almost \u00a310 for a main course of average pub food. Plus whilst the staff weren't rude they didn't seem interested either. Also why is the name in CAPITALS? I feel like I am being SCREAMED at.  Perhaps I will try WHISKI again and have a better experience. Perhaps like a good Scotsman I should just stick to the drink.
2	7AeGb5Lp7nCrhOmXqUJ19Q	"Think outside the bun" - usually only when I am starving and only have $3 to my name. But to do right by TB I have to say they do make a mean Mexican pizza.  Since I only usually go to this location there are some things I can say about it.  1) Service is always friendly and extremely fast! 2)Prices are great (hope it is actually human consumable) 3) Decent Mexican tasting food  So, when in doubt, do not go without - go with Taco Bell instead!
4	grYzYYOtNL9VIXSyRNtM4Q	La Perla is a restaurant that has been through many changes.  Some were good and some were bad.  In fact I think the food changes daily as well as the prices.  There was a time when I wouldn't step in the place, and there were other times when i couldn't have enough.  This is my second favorite of the old Glendale restaurants.  Their chips and salsa are outstanding.  I love their tacos and enchiladas as well as their rice and beans.  Every once in a while the food is sometimes a little off or burnt, but overall still very good.  Just a warning sometimes the food can be greasy and other times it can be VERY greasy.  It is all very flavorful and I would recommend it.
4	L2AUxUHoCuHhosiJs3imA	Great location. Kristina in the drive thru was very nice. I go here often and have had 0 incursions with their staff. The only reason they aren't getting 5  is because I don't necessarily like all of Jacks stuff. They need to revamp their breakfast contents. But I would recommend this location if you need a quick bite.
2	4RzkBVTqk6RWD7Pdy3Ycw	The service here was very friendly and fast.  We ordered the brie appetizer, which was very good.  The salmon entree was a little fishy and overcooked. The spinach ravioli was just okay - the sauce was decent.  The sundae for dessert was good as well.   All in all, we had a decent meal, but we would have been happier if we didn't have to pay as much for the food. It isn't quite worth the price.
4	awkSA5pFiUxxUX7HHkj3A	I love Bojangles and my husband actually wanted to go, so we made a pit stop before car shopping.   It's kind of difficult to see the sign because it's right behind the Wendy's sign, so just be aware that it's there.   The only thing I can complain about is the wait time. It was a little slow. But when we were up to the window we saw a guy walking out with 4 of those Big Bo Boxes. Crazy! I think they had to remake all of their food and that's why it was slow.   It almost worked in our advantage though, because everything was so fresh! It was great! I only got a plain biscuit, but my husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese and it was so good we almost went back to get another!
2	Ks5i2b1mYkJi6pH2g9aKQ	Major points for having one of the most wicked cool ambiences of any hang out sort of place I've ever been in. Very cool. Major deductions for crappy service, drink purchasing requirements (and frequently being out of the drink you order), and rules limiting when you can sit in the balcony area. The sheesha itself has been of varying quality. If you want hookah, you're better off going to Tempe instead.
2	Ef7ELMtvQiDU1xN4Bowg	I love diners, and I love breakfast out on the weekends.  I would love to like this place.  Food was decent.  Service was not.  And it is simply a VERY dirty place.   If they spent a half-day cleaning it, and suggested to servers to greet people and smile occasionally it would improve drastically.
4	ZR9bcmYV8BKwfUXQikD7sA	I like coming here because the service is excellent! Every time I come in, they remember my drink, and what I ordered the previous time. You get hot tea (which is amazing) as soon as you sit down, they take your order quick, and always keep your drink full. I come for dinner, but sometimes stop in for lunch. They have $5.00 lunch specials, that you get a ton of food with! I like that it is hidden in sun city, not a lot of people know about it and I am always the youngest one in there!
2	VfpEf998pLoxYdmHyrEeFA	The only reason this place even gets two stars is because of our waiter, he was very nice and fairly attentive.  The food was blah and bought, not made.  It started with the tostitos tasting chips, maybe not even that good. The salsa was boring, even tasting a little like Pace.  I had a burrito, rice, and beans, pretty standard.  The meat in the burrito was ok, nothing to write home about, but not bad.  The tortilla, again tasting like it was from a store had very little taste.  The red sauce was awful, straight out of the can.  The rice had very little to no flavor, but I will say the refried beans had  decent flavor.  Plus... $1.99 for a dollop of sour cream and $2.49 for the same in guacamole...are you kidding!!
2	HGKQwSzshQCBBLticgyqmw	If I had written this review when I initially started going to Dragon Wok about 6 years ago, this might have been 4-stars. At the time, I was really happy there was a decent Chinese place for quick eats and pick-up close-by.  Over the last few years, the quality (and quantity) of the ingredients has been going downhill.  Years ago the chow mein was made with good-quality, thick noodles - which are now much thinner and (tonight) over-cooked.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein (which I used to love) for pick-up - when we got it back home we received a pound and a half of over-cooked noodles (I actually weighed it) along with approx. 1/4 cup of veggies comprised mainly of onions, a little carrot & some cabbage and literally 7 medium-small sized shrimp (I counted). Ridiculous noodle-to-anything-else-ratio.   I'm pretty easy-going and I don't get miffed about my food much - but this kind of presentation and lack of quality just irritates the heck out of me. Come on Dragon Wok - you're my local Chinese place and I'm in your corner!  I would gladly love you if you gave me something to love!
2	AIhYDORYfQCaCcKfVoAwmg	As a general rule of thumb I'm pretty lenient on Chinese restaurants, especially the ones with great service. Mostly because I've never been to China and I'm not Chinese so I have never felt I had the authority to articulate why one place is better than the next. But...I'm going to go ahead and just say this place sucks it. I don't know what it is about the Southwest side of town but it's like there is a vacuum here where decent cheap Chinese food just can't exist.  Here's the BAD: Fried Rice...doesn't this usually have a few items in it other than rice? General Tso's chicken...I don't usually order this but i just had a taste for sesame chicken one day, and settled for this. I think the secret recipe for this dish is sweet and sour sauce and KC masterpiece. Mongolian beef...This is not supposed to be that spicy and the sauce wasn't even cooked in to the meat. It was like they cooked the meat in the wok for 30 seconds leaving it too tender but also sinewy and the sauce was tossed on as an after thought. Also the whole order was made up of about 9 giant pieces. I felt like I was eating an entire flank steak with chop stix. Service...Hey guy, can I get a little help?...I can't choke down your crap without a drink refill. And "yes, I WAS done with that crap, but next time ASK to make sure.  The Good(Acceptable): The lady that works here is an absolute sweetheart. The lunch specials are a great price and unlike most places you will be full when you leave. The little kid who sometimes runs to the front door brandishing a transformer, and stares at you as you are leaving.  If you have to eat it (as I sometimes do) get it to go. I'm sure there is something on the menu worth $6-7. So I'll let you all know if I find something.
4	DKtaZ07Ek1JOD4iDmBruA	Just had dinner there.  The service was impeccable and the food was fresh and tasty.  Ordered the walnut shrimp and house chicken, which was juicy and tender.  I love that this quaint restaurant still brings out a pot of hot tea as a standard, which isn't standard anymore in most Asian restaurants.  A must try for Asian cuisine!
4	C0Evl0slhaJJEk0jP68ZfA	YUM!  My boyfriend and I frequented this place when we used to live in Madison.  Their food is probably the most "authentic" Mexican food you'll find in the downtown area.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food (it usually makes me sick) but I always enjoyed the things I've tried here.  If you knew me you would know what a credit that is to Casa De Lara's food.  Pros: You get an bottomless basket of tortilla chips and salsa before your meal.  Great margarita deals!  Cons: The verde stuff is so hot it'll burn you mouth and you won't taste the rest of your food.
4	9H3iBb4ARrQme6nC5qf5xg	great take-out--inside has no atmosphere, very clean, for loners who don't want table service and don't mind eating with plastic utensils on styrofoam-ick.  Owners are friendly--and give efficient service.  Be careful with hours.  Weekday afternoon "break" from 2-4 PM often extends until 4:15--have not always waited--just gone elsewhere. Vietnamese specials also made by request only.
4	n0RWaSsxcdE5NM6dUbBw7A	A few friends and I decided we wanted to grab a late bite. This location closes at 10, and we were those guys that cruised in at 9:50. We all have worked in the industry at some point so we know how disheartening it can be, but we were planning on just being in and out.   Our server, Jeremy, did a great job. He was on point with refills, cheese bread refills, and pre-bussing. He was courteous and attentive, especially for it being that late at night. We ran a $90 tab and left 20%, so I'm sure he ended up being cool with it.  I ordered the Lobster, Scallops, and grilled shrimp combo platter and it was delicious. I got rice and broccoli with it, and added a Caesar salad, and a lobster bruschetta to start. Everything but the broccoli was good. The grilled lobster tail was tasty, and while the texture of the scallops seemed overcooked, I was still delighted with the flavor.   It was a good dining experience all around. In at 9:50 and out by 10:30 with no rush on the restaurants part. Appetizer, salad, entree, and then time to eat. Our server timed our experience perfectly and made for a great late night dining endeavor.
4	LbIHJUSoNbaNSYx6R3QVPA	Good hoagies, great pizza.  I highly recommend any of their specialty pizzas.  Their pierogie pizza is second to none and the turkey club pizza can't be beat.  Even when they are busy, the kitchen has a pretty quick turn around.  It's a great little place to hang out or just to get a pie to go.
2	EoZb6L0zdx1aGZmv1cAcw	My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.  You're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here.
4	n6zNQsMmjZHBc9IQagJjjg	Thank You Erica.O and Praise to Allah that I finally found some Baklava worthy of the sacred journey through my Gullet.  Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics)   The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.  The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too "green" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.  I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce.  I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)  I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.  So our waiter come over and says "Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter"  WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!  We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay???  Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.  That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!  4 stars for the Baklava at least
2	HX7ZVZqUzGk3iMXdmQvsQ	I asked for light mustard and Delvin over did it.  I asked him to take some of it off and he looked at it like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n it got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the ingredient with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for light mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.
4	KJQdqVqWX1hzoJtWPz18Hw	BB&M is named like a law firm.  I think they did it on purpose - kind of funny.  I've driven by it numerous times and always thought it looked interesting, so when I had the opportunity to grab some lunch in the area I headed over.  The place is only open during lunch hours and they seem to do a lot of catering business (for offices).  They do have a pretty large in-restaurant dining area with table service.  Their menu is pretty extensive and includes a lot of delicious looking items.  I ended up getting a Turkey Rueben and it was delicious!  The also give a cup of their soup-of-the day to all dining in customers.  It's a nice little perk before your sandwich comes out!  Besides the food, another standout was the service.  First, I did not expect and sandwich place to have tableside service.  Second, the waiter helping us out was really polite and energetic.  It was really impressive to see such amazing customer service.
4	WYQDVp08NxhmNPFznicVrg	Peppis .. well known sandwich shop in the burg.   I just started a new job in the North Side so couldn't wait to go back to Peppis.  I remember visiting the strip district location often many years ago.   I stopped in and ordered a steak hoagie.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cash only - no credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant just in case you don have any cash handy.   I was surprised at the very little meat on my hoagie especially by the price $6.75.  I might just order double meat next time.   Another surprise was that there is a burger called "#7 Roethlis Burger" which I love the idea although I have never had .. but ketchup brand offered is not "Heinz" brand.   I love the menu .. so many different types of sandwiches, salads etc. there is something for everyone.     These were just observances.. my steak hoagie was good and satisfied with the great customer service.    I just visited recently during lunch time at Noon.  As soon as I got there I regretted it but soon realized "it was all good".  The staff was so cool and calm and on the ball.. it was a zoo and the line was out the door.
4	UQTILKe9oddz83JHFBCwow	First of all, this place is dirt cheap - nothing is really over $5 - I felt like it was the 90s again!  (Sigh....)   They have delicious sandwiches - BLTs, grilled cheese, hot turkey, pulled pork.  Each sandwich also comes with two sides, such as fries, mashed potatoes, cole slaw or mac 'n' cheese.  The sides are good, but nothing spectacular.  Still, the service is great and the price is right.
2	yGZRMDGbyqxsrnYE8U9Zw	I was really happy to find a dim sum place but their food is just expensive and bad.  Their decor is just old and dirty.  Their food made my daughter so sick.  We only had dim sum that day so it must have been their food.  Why would anyone eat sushi in this place?  We did not order their sushi.  The place looks dirty, how can their sushi be fresh and clean?  It's raw.  At least with Chinese food, it's cooked.  Chinese people from the area is just happy to have some Chinese food.  They can do so much better.
2	sJcmJEEIq859DTjD2ccA	The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.
2	KKI5N0izxjPujENoDcV1g	All right.  If you're a straight lady going to Hooters then you're going for the wings.  Am I right?  Unless you're trying to prove something.  And I think I've been good about saying this - heck, I haven't had to say it yet because the QC has been a pleasant surprise for the most part - but every Hooters in Chicagoland has better wings than this Hooters.  Hell, the Hooters in Puerto Vallarta had better wings.  These were not as flavorful, the batter was not as... I don't know, flakey I suppose.  They were extremely mediocre.  Now I prefer to go to a small local joint over a chain most of the time, I prefer to try something new.  So dang it, if I want Hooters wings, they need to taste like Hooters wings!  Standardization, people!  Bah. Well, the server was sweet at least.  Sometimes when a couple walks into a Hooters, they get snubbed a bit because the waitresses are all leaning over the horny businessman tables trying to get tips. But Shaun (I think that was how it was spelled) was nice.
4	uYBCp7f5JRH1ahznEyHQ	This isn't anything fancy. It's not going to win an award for decoration or ambiance. But for what it is - mariscos - it is fantastic. The staff was also very friendly and helpful with suggestions and explanations of different items. If you like scrimps then you will enjoy this little spot!
4	YuTs4R2ELvSU9fvGk1f7WA	This place is very good. It is a mix of fast food and a general greasy spoon. It was a very clean place and the people that were running it (who were also the owners) were extremely nice. There menu is very small but they can make anything you want. I had a two meat burrito. This burrito came with your choice of two meats (sausage, bacon, ham) eggs, cheese pinto beans and potatoes! The thing was huge and after tax it only cost me $4.86! Filled me up perfectly!
2	LMeXIwXhr0MhU6d5c4dzaw	This little hole-in-the-wall, gay-friendly place is decked out with kitchy ceramic pigs and has a cozy diner feel.   It's a local spot that's open 24 hours in the Village and a great place to get late-night poutine after the bars let out...but that's about it.  The food is  simple Quebecoise comfort food (poutine, hot chicken sandwiches, pudding Chomeur) and breakfast items but it's nothing you couldn't make at home.   The portions are large- do not try to tackle an order of poutine by yourself and the prices are reasonable.  A big downside is the staff. I've gotten attitude there from one male employee on a few occasions and I still don't know why. That alone is a huge letdown. I hate when staff acts annoyed by patrons- I get it, you'd rather not be here but it's what you signed up for (this is coming from a person who's done their time in the food service industry.)   I really want to like this place but the unmemorable and sometimes bland food just doesn't do it for me.
4	7TcpjRe4Vp3UHkEx6tMKg	I will preface this by saying that I am almost a total non-drinker.  This is because of my type-1 diabetes.  But I still think that this is one of the most fun restaurants to go to in the 'Burgh!  I really like the German food they have here.  Jenney C, you may have hit it on an "off" day because I had the pot roast here and mine was very good.  The seating arrangement here, done in the "Bierstube" (sp?) style, means you'll be sharing a table with strangers.  This is simply a fun place to bring out-of-town guests and the prices, while seemingly a bit high, really aren't out of line.
2	03C4IuYDOQDyOosDeG38hQ	I went there with my husband for the 2nd time on a Sunday for lunch. When we walked in, three booths had customers in them. We waited about 13 minutes before the "grumpy old man" came out and had the attitude as if we had bothered him. So he sat us and walked away. Finally, the one waitress came over and took our drink orders. While waiting to place our lunch orders, my husband noticed a cobweb coming from the window to the fake flowers on the table. There is a considerable gap between the booth and the window. It was pretty disgusting and appeared that it had never been cleaned along with the windows and seat backs of the booths, which are cloth. We most likely will not return due to the condition of the restaurant and lackluster service. I would rather drive an extra 20 mins to Phoenix or Tempe and be appreciated. I really did try to like this place and support a local business in my community.
2	GauM9lRBaPjmOupPnMSEBA	Nosh sits right around the corner from the hotel elevators for Bally's guests in the South Tower. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're staying there it's convenient. The service is fast, and my friends adored the swinging order clips that fly between the cash register and the food station.   My big issues with the place lie in the price and the hours. It opens early enough for getting morning coffee, but it's $3.50 for a regular size. The price compares to the place across from check-in, but if you cross the street to Bill's, you can get a regular Seattle's Best for $2. The made-to-order breakfast sandwiches are great but pricey. I like the $2 hot dog option, but Nosh closes at 1am. When I wanted late night food on my retreat back to the hotel room, Nosh wasn't there for me. I tried one for lunch, and coming from Chicago, I have to say it was just fine.
4	9ms4gBxJl4mfGo9hhJO2Zg	Pino's is a relatively new find for me, and I'm so glad my friend Brian was kind enough to suggest it for lunch one day.  The other reviewers are right about the parking situation - there's not much of it!  If you get there early enough, though, you won't have a problem.  I'm a fan of simple pizza: not too much sauce, lots of cheese, and a great crust.  Pino's offers just that.  And even better, two people can go in, split a one-topping, 10" pizza and each enjoy a huge fountain drink for just over $12 total.  That's a great deal and will keep me returning time and again!
4	Wuei9UkMJbbsyMaCDhfXgQ	My ears are ringing from the loud club music and my stomach is a growlin' I'm kinda drunk still, so what do I do? I go to Whataburger at 2:30am, that's what I do. Tonight's craving was Onion Rings. Jack in the Box was blocked off due to the New Year's Eve block party in Tempe, so we stopped here instead. Good move.  The onion rings were delivered piping hot. The dude warned us, and he was right. I'm convinced there was a grease fire going in the bag there for a bit. You could heat a house with what was coming out of the cardboard box of fried onion goodness.  And these onion rings are pretty damn decent. Horrible for me, I'm sure, but I don't really care at this point. And the KETCHUP (all caps on the container,) it comes in a dip-able container. No bags of ketchup here... only "Fancy KETCHUP."  There's two onion rings left... but they are ALL MINE!  UPDATE: The onion rings are all gone! I ate them all!
2	Ds5raNLSOVkcIEgCDnhw	Most of the time that I go through to get a Frappuccino their machine is down. You would think think that they would get a new machine instead of fixing a machine that keeps breaking down  Starbucks at least works
4	pwyRjVBm9rNV3Z9ggqfg	This has been a qdoba i've been going to for at least 7 years. I love how soft they steam the burrito wraps. I officially think that if you are going to get burritos, qdoba might just be better than chipotle. However, chipotle does have the cilantro and lime rice. I also learned that even though it is not written on their menus, you can get the bowl style that chipotle offer at qdoba. Just ask for your burrito in a bowl with the wrap separate they will put it on an aluminum foil for you. Nice location and  i will be back for my next qdoba craving!
4	YEVU6WkFTjmMbkxqBoFUCw	I absolutely love this place but my most memorable time here was with my cousin who decided she had to get plastered after hearing bad news.  So, being the caring family member I am, I opted for the same beverage she ordered--a Long Island Iced Tea.  In my previous experience, a LIIT is usually somewhat drinkable, however, Thai Thai must have only thought a Long Island is made by mixing whatever alcohol you have in whatever quantity of each you feel like.  HORRIBLE TASTING!  But man, was I hammered!!!  Anyways, the food is great, can't say much about the actual restaurant inside as I've always dined on the patio.  Contrary to a previous review, I have never been charged for extra rice, but maybe they just liked me? ;) Some of the appetizers are extremely pricey for what you get though, but the rest is pretty normal Scottsdale prices.  Bottom Line: Best Thai in Phoenix
4	z0cAv66KDBvDA1CRtKWWIQ	I am not a huge fan of thin, New York style pizza but I have to say It totally hit the spot.  2 Huge slices and a large 32oz Mt Dew for $5.90.   The crust was great. It had good flavor, nice crisp bottom and nice chewy dough. I even asked if they changed recipes or something. He said they use really good flour and like a freakin magic man, the flour was being delivered as we spoke. 6 or 8 #40lb bags. No frozen crust here.   The place itself is cool, nothing great nothing bad.   The employees are nice if you talk to them otherwise they leave you alone.
2	kQbr9vB31fuFm39ndrMEg	Five...five...five dollar foot longs. This song is very catchy indeed. However the footlongs do not catch my taste buds for long.(no pun intended) Do not get me wrong the bread is fresh and so are the vegetables. The cold cuts? Hmmm not so sure. The grilled chicken pieces they use for the sandwiches, I do not trust. It looks like soy meat. I know it is only $5.00 but for the amount of money I spend on four subs I cold buy sandwich ingredients from the grocery store that will probably last me a week. Better quality too.
4	ix1JQzqoHddObrfcYF3g	Stopped for breakfast yesterday morning and they were supper fast and everything was fresh and just as I order. Did I mention that the staff is supper friendly? I live close to the McDonalds on Bethany Home, they are terrible. I'll drive out of the way for always fresh French fries from now on.
2	YRlaKahteWkpILNglJ7RNQ	We were in the area, and heard that the area was a known for the Portuguese community, so we wanted to try the portuguese cusine. This restaurant looked good from the outside...  The waiter who served us speak little english....well...we were used to it now that we had spent a few days in quebec city, and montreal...  so he told us about this absolutely worthy chef tasting menu, that sounded really good...3 tasting portion of meats, including filet, chicken and 3 tasting portion of seafood, including escargos, squid and a seafood rice dish, and it comes with soup and salad....but my heart was kinda unsettling that i was wondering if i wanted the chef to "dictate" what i am eating...one of my friends don't like seafood, so she opted for ordering a la carte...  The waiter went through things really fast, so i had a hard time following...my friend had to literally go to get him to make sure he didn't place the orders of the tasting menu before we were ready to order.   The soup came and it was pretty good....quite promising....my friend's steak dish came, looked pretty good.....quite promising on how the rest of hte tasting menu would be....  finally our seafood portions of tasting dish came...i was expecting that they would come course by course and in separate plates, instead, they came all on one plate that has 3 separate small compartments, kinda like those nuts/snack plates at party. No biggies. I am green, save dish, save water, save on dishwashing detergent.... so you could imagine the portion is really small, like 2 bites, the taste if the dishes....mediocre at best... the same thing with the "land dishes"....i should have listened to my heart and went with a la carte....  the dessert is the portguese tart...this one is better than those i had in Hong Kong/ Macau...but it wasn't warm or anything...we saw a tray of it sitting out next to the bar area, so they probably just grabbed from that tray....  we should have be alerted when the serve asked if we were using coupon when we first walked in.....
4	CozFvCwbVIojjTOOp4yrA	I really loved the hummus and pita bread. I am big fan of mediterranean and make sure I try it every place I go to. This is my all time favourite. It was made so fresh and served so well. The hookah was smooth and non-ashy. Definitely worth the money! Not too costly a place also.
4	JEVeZqsVl3Le1PIpgENsdw	I actually really like the subs at Jimmy John's.  They're pretty much no-nonsense quick cold subs.  No salads, no soups, no toasting.  You can get chips and a cookie if you want, but that's pretty much all for sides.  (I think they might have pickles too?)  Anywho, the subs are huge and tasty and very quick!
2	4TaK2l6vVUcQhKWiop3vYw	We happened to be in carland at supper time and elected to grab a quick supper out rather than coming home to an empty fridge.   The good:  Service was fast and friendly. The people are definitely the high point of this chain resto.   The mediocre: If you come here, be safe and stick with the rotisserie chicken with fries and salad bar. (For any other choice, the salad bar is $3.75 extra.) Fries were good and chicken was acceptable but not great. The salad bar was clean. Unexciting options even compared to supermarket bagged salad, but fine.  The ugly: The hot chicken sandwich was disgusting. The gravy (obviously from a mix) was chemically-tasting and the bread was, well, mushy sawdust is the closest analogy.   We should have gone to St-Hubert across the street, or even Wendy's on the next block.
4	xN1nhXjafmj8tWUc8IvpHA	Been to this place many times as it is a favorite of my wife and kids. Although this may not be award winning barbecue it is still respectable and the all you can eat portion fits even the largest of bellies full of what ever item you like unless you like ribs or brisket.  Four sauces to choose from to keep the flavor changing and plowing throw the tiny plates of meat refills. You can really give the waitress a workout as you reorder plate after plate of approximately 2 ounce portions of meat. Sure they have small lunch portions and the not all you can eat portions but where is the fun in that. For some reason they brought out two sides as a sort of garnish for the true meal....the meat. Granted like I said it is not award winning but that doesn't stop me from going to an all you can eat Chinese buffet either.
4	ahE9JxOnpTE4pWkm0ytl2w	Soooooooo I used to go to this place was I was a small child and just went there for the first time in about....7-9 years last night. OMG YUM! I love love love their food. I ordered a dinner special (there's 4) and they give you sooooooo much food for $7-8. I got the sesame chicken, fried rice, chicken lo mein, crab puff, and egg roll plate. It also came with egg drop soup. I LOVE egg drop soup, but most places don't make it good. They made some of the best I've ever had. Next time I go, I am just ordering a big bowl of that. Anyway, I had to pay an extra $1.50 because I substituted the sesame chicken for the teryiaki chicken. No biggie, it was still a steal! My BF got the sweet and sour pork with fried shrimp and lo mein and fried rice. He loved it too. He said their hot mustard was the hottest he's ever had.......and then ran a train on it :o) Only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. But hey, who rates a restaurant on that?? It just stunk and was also used as a storage closet. Anyway, if you're out this way, stop in. You'll get amazing food for an unbelievably low price. No wonder they've been in business for 15-20 years.
2	LkxM28VGfM5Fn5nLycvcHQ	I was looking forward to eating at Chop Chop because of the rave review my friends gave it (to me) 7 weeks ago.  I booked to eat on a Thursday night, as it was my last night in Edinburgh and i decided to treat myself.    What a Disappointment! When i arrived the restaurant was empty, apart from the 4 waiting staff. When i was seated at my table i discovered that the plates were made of plastic. Really not what i was expecting at all.    I started off by ordering 16 boiled Pork and Coriander dumplings with 8 Chicken Fried dumpling. I also had a Chicken Chow Mian and deep fried aubergines. The Pork and Coriander dumplings were very bland, which I'm guessing is why you have soy sauce and vinegar on your table, there was no taste what so ever. The fried chicken dumplings tasted better, I could actually taste the chicken. The Chow Mien, again was very bland and the chicken was like rubber. I had to resort to pouring my dumpling dipping sauce over the Chow Mian to give it some flavour. plus, the portion of Chow Mian is huge for one person, I couldn't finish it as there was so much. Lastly, the Aubergines. They were absolutely disgusting. Completely soaked in oil, so much so I could not taste the spring onion and garlic that the aubergines  I paid \u00a330 for all this and a small bottle of spring water, not the great value i was told about.    Their website states that they make their own noodle and dumplings, in fact the dumplings are not made in the restaurant, but in a custom built factory in Edinburgh's suburbs.    The staff are the only reason why I am not giving Chop Chop 1 star, they were great. Very friendly and helpful.    So all in all, a grand disappointment. It does seem that the owners have spent so much time and effort with the new restaurant in Leith that they have all but forgotten the original Haymarket restaurant.
2	4FJKvJAQVMgtUhNo0mzSYQ	Awful customer service. Huge line and customers keep leaving the shop before even they get to register to order their meals. Unexperience employee that is so slow, and not even understand customers orders to put in the computer. Manager on duty simply staying at the register and do nothing. When I brought the problem to his attention,  he said: "He will get better." This is my last visit to this location. Dirty floor.  Wish I could talk to the main office. Terrible experience.
2	hJ2bNiVK9BA16N72CGVHA	I really don't get why people love this chain so much.  That's great that the burgers are not frozen but when I eat them I don't get a good meaty flavor, all I taste is grease.  I very much prefer the sirloin burgers at Jack-in-the-Box.  And I don't like the whole "secret menu" concept.  Call me crazy, but I want to know what my options are when I walk into a restaurant, not have to study a website beforehand.  This place is just not my thing, I guess.
2	wgBaBMXpYcEL7PvM7CB3Q	I'm in Montreal for a couple days for meetings along with the rest of our division.  Eight of us had supper at Restaurant L'Orignal in Old Montreal.  It was cute inside.  I ordered the pork special.  I specifically said I just wanted potatoes and pork.  When it came, there were also asparagus and mushrooms.  When I mentioned it to our server, she said I must have miscommunicated with her.  Yet when I looked at the bill afterwards, it did say that I just wanted mashed potatoes.  So there!  The pork was apparently wrapped in plastic and poached in spices and then grilled to order.  It was okay, not great.  The mashed potatoes were cold and too pureed/mushy.  I was shocked when the bill came to see that it was $29!  Desserts were a bit hit around the table!  I had blueberry crumble ... it was delicious!  It was the best part of the meal!  I'm not a fancy schmancy diner so it's a treat when I'm in a nice restaurant.  Though our server was friendly and took good care of us (other than saying I had miscommunicated with her), I wasn't impressed with the food, especially considering the prices.
4	A0hFhhS25BL1JSCLxed3w	Nice little spot! Stopped in for a late breakfast on our home from Scottsdale.  I had a wonderful omelet and my partner had the choriso with eggs ... both were very good! Clean establishment, good service and the spaceship quirkiness was not over the top!
2	1zklxhbJoKnE0uXrVxw	One of the closer Wendy's. My wife and I do not go here very often anymore. We had food missing from our order, cold or burnt sandwiches, and salads that were very wilted.   The lights for the restaurant and drive through are turned off some nights at 9 or 10 pm. It doesn't seem like they are open. We went through the drive through and were the only ones there. A lot of service errors for just us being served.   Would gladly go back if the service and quality went back up.
2	WqwOIr4YN4xMNUDyEXefA	I visited this restaurant on a busy and crowded Friday night. We had reserved a table for 6 earlier on in the week but were seated in an incredibly congested area. The place was loud but lively however the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered the lamb chops which were burnt and others ordered the chicken which was dry and the pizza which wasn't anything special. It is a BYOW place though.
2	422ZJVqK0tpTsQJqh5lA	Meh, pretty much says it all.  From what I hear the management changes sometime earlier this year and pretty much screwed this place up.  The story goes that some "silent" partners decided to speak up and make some changes for the better.  Unfortunately, most silent partners are silent for a reason.  They took an interesting neighborhood gastropub-esque restaurant and turned it into another generic Charlotte bar.  The pot roast and the meat loaf were essentially the same thing, but surprisingly the pot roast was drier!  It was served with wilted romaine lettuce mixed in to a gelatinous brown salt mixture, which I suspect was whipped up with a generous portion of corn starch and bullion cubes.  Skip it.
2	4YcCL9yoASgaCyZ63oA	Food was really subpar for the price. I've had MUCH better soup based noodles. Won't go again unless I have a huge craving for Thai and Vietnamese. And even then, I would consider other places first.
2	VeazC4WhmCtjRCxnK8LiMw	Went there to meet someone after I've already ate at Olive garden on Sunday (read previous review). It was 7 pm and this place was EMPTY! I was bit surprised. We walked in towards bar area. there were only 2 other people there. We weren't hungry, but I can always eat (as I'm munching on kimchee right now), especially seafood. so I glazed thru their menu. I noticed 'micro brew' in beer section. Since I love beer, I asked if they brew their own (hence, micro-brew...) She pointed out bluemoon, sam adams, and something else... Ummmm, I have never seen any restaurant categorize them as "Micro-Brew" oh well, I got bluemoon. $4.25 for a pint.   My friends had ahi-tuna salad. I glazed thru the menu some more for food, but nothing really sounded good...  It was a very short trip to the place. Had a beer, and left. by the time we left (8pm) they've already shut down the dinning area.   I guess we won't be coming back here anytime soon.
4	aHh1ilcak3TQzXg5PSwg	Excellent Mexican food with lots of flavor. I appreciated the vegetarian option and enjoyed the spinach enchiladas.  Very nice people working there, all were helpful, and the service was good.  Casual atmosphere and an interesting spot to see and watch the surrounding activities in this truly fun western town.  I look forward to my next visit to try a few other choices on the menu.
2	J4ERmNBDhs1Qb4H9oGY9w	Let me preface this by saying that I have eaten at SEVERAL of the Grand Cafes in the Stations Chains (the worst by far to this point has been the one at Red Rock) over the years. I used to eat in them back when they existed the first time, then when they became Denny's and Coco's, and again when they were brought back again as Grand Cafes. I have to say that with the exception of Kim, Wayne, Charles and Joey on the Graveyard Shift (and they are the reason I raised the overall to 2 stars instead of 1 or 0 stars), I have pretty much had nothing but horrible experiences at the one at the Santa Fe Station.  The most recent issues have occured over the last 2 days (12-29 and 12-30-12). For starters, they have decided that you can only have one slice of toast (cut in half to "2" pieces of toast) on your breakfast meals. Then, NONE of their cooks apparently have learned how to cook an egg over-easy. Next, when you ask for a side of toast (again only one slice cut into halves), it is $2.99 for that one slice of bread. Then, on their menu it says you can substitute soup or salad, however when you try to order the soup over night, they tell you that they no longer serve soup at night.  I am sure that Stations people won't see this, but I do have to say that if you go to these cafes, you have a better time than I have the last few times. I hate to say it, but I think I am going to have to start going back to Denny's for my early morning breakfasts.
2	9zty8zx3HiLbOJaEQtpw	Everything tastes like the same Chinese-made for American taste buds. The restaurant that was here prior had far better flavor. It was overpriced for what you get but I guess there's quite a bit variety thus my two star rating. Also the remodelled look with neon lightsnis just tacky.
2	AqrpckUnDI3Iw5qe7W1KA	Apparently the other reviewers have never had "mexican" food outside of quebec. Otherwise they would know that nothing they serve at this place is even close to being considered mexican food. Service was good, so that's what got them a full two stars instead of one. If you just want some random concoctions of food with sweet sauces, then this is your place.
2	Iyql3fCjr8hgwg8XANBjA	Decent food. But.... I ordered an Irish coffee, and they gave me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey on the side. I asked the bartender if she knew how to make this simple drink. She said, "we don't do that here". Wow. I asked for the remaining ingredients, and I was charged for each individual ingredient. $17.00 Irish coffees at Brazwells. Condescending staff.
4	cOqBGEuqaq8ZUSMoHULg	The food is McDonalds quality, you either like it or you don't, but I like that they are fast & hire very nice young people (OMG! Only old people say that, so I must be getting up there, lol). I'm giving them 4 stars because it's always a pleasant experience to go through their drive through :)   I do have to add that their speaker was on the fritz & I did let them know. Still, it's not like I wasn't going to drive another few feet & talk to someone in person. At 5 am when I'm prepping for my long drive East, this is really not a big deal, lol.   I've been inside & it could probably use a remodeling, but it is what it is!
4	tvOiSInxhHQjnDNwScOqQ	Zarra's is amazing.  All the food is homemade and very good.  This family owned restaurant is a fabulous find and I strongly suggest anyone who likes outstanding Italian food to try it.  The decor remindes me of an estate sale that serves wonderful food. The menu changes for the weekend so come during the week for a larger choice.
4	5n7634cx3rkwz3FNMbkd9Q	well, hell.  my 100th review had to go to something special right?  South 21 I guess you'll be it.    The onion rings are to DIE for.  Love them.  Perfect crunch, even after they got a bit cold.  The crust on it, oh man, golden brown and delicious!  I got the fried chicken.  YUM!  The crust on the onion rings were basically the same on the fried chicken.  They were nice and crunchy and the chicken was moist, and I got white meat.  Granted, it's not the best fried chicken I've had, but this is definitely up there for sure, just on the moistness of the chicken and the crust.  I do wish there was more flavor in either the crust or the chicken.    And to top it off - I got a cherry SunDrop to drink.  Now that was awesome since it wasn't the bottled kind - it was mixed at the place, which just tastes better.  Sorry - I usually do real well with pictures, but we were all eating from our laps in the car, so it was a bit rough.  Thank you South 21.  I guess there is good reason why you are still around after all these years!
2	eWqxs0CSljsygFMLNI7B1w	I wanted to like this place, I really did since it is so close to home and a family-owned restaurant, but I had a very disappointing experience tonight.  I went with my father.  We ordered the yellowtail roll, the philly roll, and the surf and turf roll.  We liked the philly the best, but weren't impressed with the others.  The surf and turf was saturated in sauce and totally fell apart.  The portions were small for the price we thought.  Also, we were overcharged and the server didn't want to adjust our bill. I thought the decor was pretty cute, but I could have done without the big TV screen.   I won't be returning here in the future.
4	ETrJ9xs3zC7qtppDNQYdg	I just ate at this place on Saturday.  Most of you (I'm willing to bet :)) don't spend a lot of time hanging out in the neighborhood of 31st Ave and Van Buren.  I teach at a school there and have been making it a point to track down any and all great little food places.  El Taquito is great.  It's bright yellow on the outside.  The inside is clean, with about 8 booths.  There was a guy singing and playing guitar (not sure if he was paid by the restaurant, or just doing his own thing).  I got the cherviche tostada, which was basically Pico de Gallo with shredded shrimp added to it on top of a fried corn tortilla.  Amazing!  It's the first time I've eaten Mexican and not felt all greasy afterwards.  Everyone else's food looked great too (the taquitos were so small!).  I'll be back for sure.
2	xuEemRtno8lPfGru8RsdA	Touting themselves: "Rated AAA Four-Diamond. Simple. Sophisticated. Splendid" seems somewhat hubristic. Mom and I went for the prix fixe Christmas dinner, which we figured would be foolproof, as they had to make a bunch and would only use tried and true dishes. Well, not so much. Foie gras: oily to the point of being wet, resting on a soggy filo something and served with egg nog (?!) dipping sauce. Octopus salad: too chewy by half. Roasted squab breast: gamy, and somewhat overcooked. "Chef's Selection" bread pudding: too much dessert after such a hearty, if uninspired meal. Boring is also the term I would also use for the other courses and sides, although the Kobe Rib Eye was yummy. Obsequious to the point of cavity-inducing would be the phrase I would use to describe the staff, although they were there when needed. In sum, except for the foie gras, nothing was horrible, but nothing was spectacular either. For a "4 Diamond" restaurant, the experience was just... meh. For the price: fuhgetaboutit!
2	Q8OnWpXCj6iheZPFHBEbw	Got 2 sandwiches ,one turkey ,one roast beef with Gorgonzola along with a clam chowder's bread for both sandwiches was so hard It was almost a joke.Not much meat either.My Friend wound up throwing hers away.I was starving and ate mine but it was an unejoyable chore to do so.The Soup was fine ,nothing to write home about.Being from Boston I'm spoiled by really good sandwich's was a disappointment and I wont be going back.
4	muObFn48fbuxbZvBJfQ	Family owned & operated (big fan of supporting these!), Mario's offers choices.  The menu includes pizzas (stuffed & deep dish too), sausage rolls, pastas galore, salads, burgers, subs, etc....and a plethora of what looked like really good desserts.  Casual place to take kids, especially when you want to watch a game.  They have HDTV'S.    We ordered a couple slices of cheese pizza (very good flavor) and a couple of subs (a turkey & an Italian-#3) per their recommendation.  Hard to beat these when you can order it your way.  The only complaint...the provolone was left off of one.     Dine indoors/outdoors, pick up, order on line, have it delivered, or catered.  Adults looking for something a little more upscale???  Visit John's Place next door.  They serve Mario's anytime the bar is open!
4	xzD0wZpbwMnxiylgxyu3Q	This is a great place for a standard- issue bacon and eggs breakfast. A freindly and efficient staff handles tables inside and out with grace and humor. Clearly the plethora of regulars speak volumes about the quality of the food and the service.
2	rcgM6DPxzUIrb3BywVIrg	I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.    POSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food.   Negative: very limited selection.
4	HyqmTbfOgrcLlrn0HA3Pw	LoLo's  tragically, I have tried to maintain a plan to loose some extra pounds. For you are the best place in town to pack on the spare bulk. Nothing at LoLo's could be considered "healthy". But everything can be considered extra tasty.  Take a drive, or maybe a walk to LoLo's and fill up on some of the best, southern style, down home food you will find west of Louisiana.  Just bring a bib, and an appetite
4	hAL9SyuYqYfDoJYccUcKA	Alberto was so cute!  He cheerily greeted us and showed us to the bar.  We ordered the bruschetta with wine while we waited for our to-go order to be prepared.  Alberto visited with us briefly to ensure we enjoyed our bruschetta - and we loved our appetizer!  YUM!  Fresh, fresh, fresh tomatoes and bursting with flavor!  It was fun just being a part of the experience at Alberto's!.  Try the desserts!
4	1uh92cf3DDu5JThaJuPVg	My wife and i eat here a lot since it is in our neighborhood.  Today we met up with me parents who are in town.    My parents had the two for $20 special.  I went with a new entree that had roasted , smashed baby red potatoes,  artichoke hearts, peppers and onions over a sirloin steak with a balsamic glaze.  My entree was excellent.  I will definitely try this one again.  The Shocktop on draft was very cold and excellent.  Service was on the spot.  All our needs were taken care of and our waiter stopped by periodically to make sure we were doing well.  The place was very busy which is something we don't see all the time.  Overall another good visit to this location.  We will be going back.
2	hoCKsxobb9Mm9aGdTP3w	This place just opened at this location in December and being that there are very few places in Queen Creek to eat, I thought I would give it a try. It is in a strip shopping center and the first thing to note is that it was crowded. Plenty of outside seating wraps around the business, but it was slightly chilly so I chose inside. Actually it was warmer outside. The next thing I noticed was the door said breakfast or lunch and one window promoted "meats" and french fries. There were several workers, so I figured it would be a quick service.   The table next to me had a couple that had already ordered and only had their drink. Eventually a lady walked up and asked if someone took their order and they said yes. Our order was taken  and other people arrived, which filled the room (seating is maximum 45). Later tthe couple left, only throwing a couple of bucks on the table. No food ever arrived. Someone asked about it and the waitress indicated they wanted lunch and the restaurant was only serving breakfast (at 11:30?) - and why no one told them it was breakfast only, I don't know. I noticed that the table across from me received their order. The little girl a large bowl of oatmeal, the wife something that was correct and the husband a large plate of pancakes and sausage. He informed the waitress that wasn't what he ordered. She took it back and returned a few minutes later with the correct food.   The waitress came to our table and gave us a bowl of "scones". It wasn't like any scone I have ever had. Two small cookie like items that were kind of sweet and tasted like the cookie part of a chocolate chip cookie (no chocolate). Next I hear the waitress delivering food to the table behind me (which came in after we did). Ironically, she called out the same things that I ordered - a breakfast burrito and a side of biscuits and gravy. Seems odd two tables would order that combo. She delivered another tables order and one of the patrons identified part of their order as incorrect. The guy behind me, after eating part of the burrito, realized that wasn't what he ordered. The waitress was called over and she also determined that should have been mine instead of his. She never came to my table to tell me about it or say it was coming - instead she called out to the kitchen she needed another one. Probably 15 minutes later mine arrived. My friends had still not come yet. The waitress looked at what she delivered and gave the biscuits and gravy to my friend. She said that  was mine - then the lady reversed them. I said no, those are both mine. The waitress turned to my friend and said "you didn't want anything?" She reminded her that she ordered a ham and cheese omlet with wheat toast. The waitress headed back to the kitchen and blamed them. 10 minutes later returned with the omlet - which looked like I made it. I can't cook, which is why I go out. It looked like folded over fried eggs with Kraft singles on the top. We reminded her about the wheat toast. Several minutes later and still no toast. I called her over and asked how the wheat toast was coming. She checked with the kitchen asking the exact same thing. Another 5 minutes and we had toast.  The service shouldn't have been slow because there were several workers. I can get by with slow service, but when there are 3 orders mixed up or arrive in courses and someone walks out, maybe that isn't the line of work for you. The food was just okay - when they say family restaurant just like home, that is no lie! It looked and tasted like I cooked it. Given my level of skill, I eat out a lot. I won't need to go back for a repeat visit any time soon.
2	dyhswRHM56yJ42OmZMbLA	After my dental visit, we got hungry and Roland was in the mood for chinese noodle soup.  We went to Rice N Noodle, but after looking at the menu, the noodle are the chow mein/lo mein, and not the noodle soup that he was looking for.  Then he spotted Baidu, in which there was a big sign "Gourmet Chinese Food" so I gave a nod of approval to  stop and look at the menu.  When we walked into the restaurant, it looked decent.  However, after looking at the menu, it's freakin' american chinese!  Dang it!  Because we were pressed for time, we just had to grab a quick bite here.  Roland ordered a crappy soup with noodle...oh wait, it's the house special soup with noodle, and sure was special, specially horrendous.  When I go to this kind of american chinese places, I order the orange beef.  Hot Wok always let me order the orange beef lunch portion, but when we asked if we may order this here, the response was "not possible."  Whatevs.  I ended up ordering the safest choice I could find that I may enjoy, the crab rangoons.  Even then, they were crappy. The cream cheese was not creamy.    The only positive thing about my lunch experience here was the waitress.  She was quite nice, but never again will I come back.
4	QelcWrwiPx4TwHUEsFphsw	I love this location! i mean its ghetto and ive seen a lot of crazy things happen here lol. But they're customer service is awesome, the food is awesome of course! its always nice and warm when it comes out, the staff nice and friendly and its just feels kind of homey here :)
4	qhaMgU92KcDcGgjpcNFQBg	Jump on the Pita Jungle bandwagon!!! The food is definitely worth it!! There really isn't much else to say, but the food is great! Oh and the atmosphere is awesome, servers are great and if you are feeling up to it you can eat outside.  Hummus is great and the pitas are well put together.  BTW - Two people can have beverages, appetizers and meals for about 20$....not that I am cheap, but I am a college student. Nice deal in my book!
2	ALdWAnB2YCUYSaKlhL6tA	My wife and I have been here twice and while the service is great the food is just not what we expect from a chain that includes the word "Lobster" in its name.  Everything I've ordered from this location has been sub par.  The shrimp dishes are messy and swimming in unnecessary, unidentifiable liquid.  The pasta dishes made me feel like I was eating hay.  Aside from that the place is thoroughly clean and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Personally I wouldn't eat here for free.
4	f2m74tEShNFoaRxjegIE2A	Great restaurant in downtown Madison. Interestingly, the water served at the table has a little surprise - a cucumber floating in it! If you try really hard you can almost taste it, and it's not bad.   We started with the fried calamari that is served with a chipotle-plum glaze. It was an excellent start to what turned out to be an excellent meal. My next course was the Caeser salad then on to Ancho & Orange Glazed Tenderloin, which was served with roasted Yukon gold potatoes and roasted apples & pears. Everything was cooked just right and the tenderloin was heaven. The sauce is fairly spicy but extremely flavorful.  The decor of the restaurant, to me, is somewhat modern but very tasteful. I've only been here once, but I recommend you try it.
4	yTYSU4iL0gv0jqYZnJft5Q	So I must have driven by this place like a zillion times on my drive up to "Target-to" at Spectrum, and it was finally when a buddy of mine told me how good this place was that I finally decide to give it a shot.   He recommended the toasted turkey sub with the sesame bread - very specifically the sesame bread. So, sure enough, I give it a whirl, and you know, he was right.  It was a great sandwich. The other choices sounded just as good am I'm sure I'll try 'em. Oh, and the beer choices doesn't hurt towards a good review.
2	gMCIAMPFTfya8tsaG0INQ	Late night, heading back to the hotel and decide to try Carls Jrs. I got my food and headed down the road taking bites here and there in the dark, and the burger had no flavor, like it lacked seasoning or something. Get to my room and pull the burger out to finish it and find I'm eating RAW MEAT!! The burger was brown outside but RED inside. Fries were just "alright", so you can believe I won't go back again..
2	P7NfvGilu7crFMppmKWGQ	I used to hang out at the bar.  It has changed over the years.  I think they are trying to save money by cutting back on staff.  Last 2 times there have made me decide to not go back.  The food is ok, but the service has been sooooo slow it is not worth it.  Sorry guys have to let BW3 go.
2	z6Cz7NO7WHiSXCTYaK1Zpg	.......closed? D:'  It most definitely wasn't really good, but there's something about MSG and Sodium saturated, super-Americanized, low quality Chinese food in a buffet setting for less than 10 bucks that just hits the spot. Even though it had been over a year since my last visit, I can't lie, I am gonna miss the place a bit.
2	PsA98kmRdHo47vrjp9AvyQ	I am rating the food.  (Not the bar).  Let's say, I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet, and pound the crap out of it--so that it's shape isn't even round any more.  That is their Backdraft Burger.  Don't even try to order a medium rare one. They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint.  Was disappointed with their burger.  As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars.
2	se7c01TxGJ66UL27PPjQ	My husband and I had a rare evening alone and decided to celebrate 12 years of being together by going to BLT at the Camelback Inn.   Seated promptly on the patio the view and the weather were perfect.  That pretty much was the highlight of the evening....other than the popovers.    The service was absolutely horrible.  Our waiter clearly had too many stations and couldn't seem to give us any attention.  We are not the type of couple who like a lot of attention but it was 45 minutes before placing our order.  We ordered from the fixed price menu and were really surprised that the appetizers took 20 minutes to come out, and the main course was another 20 minutes after they took the appetizers away.  My husband had ordered the rib eye with sweet breads.  He ordered the rib eye medium rare and it came out overly well done.   I had the diver scallops were which cooked perfectly, served cool - which was disappointing, and the ragout of lima beans (nearly raw) and olives was too salty for my palate.   We tried to get our waiters attention to let him know about the steak, but after 3 attempts and over 15 minutes, we gave up - signaled a manager, and the meal was removed from the bill.    We had a great night otherwise.  It was nice just to be outside looking at the mountain and enjoy each other's company.   We spent 3 hours on a 3 course dinner and I truly loved all the time together.  We may try again another time as there did appear to be many wonderful sounding dishes on the menu and the atmosphere was nice.  From the other yelpers it sounds like we had an off night, but for the prices and the hype - consistency should be a given.
4	l7GVP8ZxGoxy15J2VhvICA	Oh dear. I'm in love with bojangles. That is one really tasty biscuit. I've only been to 2 other bojangles near south park and this one is def tons better than that one.  They put chunks of beef in the gravy for mash potatoes AND in their dirty rice!  Chicken is great, not as amazing as Price's but I come here for lunch a lot. Did i mention how much i love their biscuits!?
4	34KyTJFpVYYViBSK4Gzog	I was doing some window-shopping and my stomach reached up and punched me in the face.  I fell into a Greek restaurant which I could deal with because I love falafel.  The noticed that the caf\u00e9 was loaded with teenie-bobber couples, probably from the high school across the street.  Oh well, I spotted a few quiet places available for me to enjoy my meal.    The cashier seemed unenthusiastic and her she wore her hat so low that it looked like she was trying to hide something.  I ordered the falafel with a side of fries.    The food popped up within ten minutes and the place was crowded!  I enjoyed my waitress, she had a sweet personality and quick on the refills.  The unsalted French fries were huge and steamy and the Falafel was hot and crunchy.  I do have a suspicion that the fafalel was frozen and recooked, but good nonetheless.  They played Smashing Pumpkins, Honey, and I thought for a minute about dessert, but I had to run.  Baklava next time!
4	hnbwDvBvx0P06HU2whY2kg	Don't be put off by the appearance. The great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this). The menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat. There is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio. There is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad. It is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only.
2	T2T3WRThUglgtzP7r3PCKA	Nice decor, so-so food.  Probably the most bland pho I've had in the Valley.  Nothing particularly negative about it - except of course bland pho is fairly negative.  The menu selection is also fairly limited compared to every other Vietnamese place I visit (Da Vang comes to mind, but who can compare with them?).  I'm going to go try a  few other selections and am keeping my fingers crossed they warrant an upgrade to 3 stars.  But can't do it based on the pho alone.
2	KzaXtcNV8q6eQDv3AuMoUg	Being a So Cal native, I never saw what the big deal is with this place for out of tonwners! Its OK, its a big, sloppy burger. And, its fast food. OK... Big deal. Their french fries suck, they are mushy and crisp. They have a very limited menu, which I guess is sort of the appeal. There are much better burgers in town and I don't think this place is any good at all.
4	zWMSR2FAzz2SHsy1A3eig	OK, so this isn't in my neighborhood... but it used to be. I grew up down the road and spent many a date, night after the football game, and lunch with the girlfriends here. Wonderful food and even better service. Has lots of room for groups for special events. The pasta dishes are all good and I love the antipasta salad. Try the goat cheese and artichoke pizza for a change.
4	OzDItcuGJWtB7NlZIkIK2Q	OMG, I practically inhaled my food.  The kare-kare was thick and creamy.  YUMMMM!  That was my favorite part of the meal.  And my sago drink was delicious.  This place was hella crackin.  The line curved around the restaurant.  GOOOOOOD foood!!!  I kinda wish I savored my meal, but whatevz, who needs to chew when you can just shallow.. lol.
2	wga0wiUAVbvMmLg1W1Scww	Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation.
4	qKLDWWhr8lNJsXRN5XdAJg	Bagel Nosh is a quaint little bagel shop. They have a multitude of bagels to choose from.  I had a breakfast egg bagel sandwich and half dozen bagels for coworkers. This looks like a small family owned bagel shop, which is nearest bagel shop respective to work.  The prices are quite reasonable too!
4	QXJL9XoTGl8PQlYICkL0Q	D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S Crepes. If you go here and you are a crepe fan I would say they have the best crepes out of other breakfast joints I have tried. If your not a crepe fan they do have lots of other items. Their omelets are good too (big portion so share with someone). Pancakes are delicious and fluffy, especially their blueberry ones. You know how come places have just the sauce of blueberry which kind of overpowers the enjoyment of a pancake, well their pancakes are not like that. They put the blueberries in their batter, the way I like it.
4	qpHo45xO7YByzO5Cv67ruA	I might a bit of a snob when it comes to tacos being from southern Cal, but Roberto's is really good. This location is my favorite in town - you would think they would all be the same, but this location is the best.  The portions are big, the food is cheap, and it tastes good. It's a little greasy, but hey, it is a taco shop. All of the meats are marinated and have good flavor. The burritos are awesome and huge, tacos come fried or soft shell, and then the Super Nachos.... I think these  break the maximum calorie barrier, but they are good.  Staff here is nice. They are quick, good cooks, and the cashiers will joke around with you on occasion.  No alcohol here, but the place is connected to a bar.  We have a different Roberto's closer to us and we drive a little out of the way for this one. Good place, good food.
2	pFFPizG0ufttpsffbdD97g	The place was a mess when we came for a bite to eat after checking at night.  The staff was very friendly, but every other table was trashed and dirty.   My friend and I shared a Patty Melt and Oriental Chicken Salad for around $20 total.  The Patty Melt was super hot and pretty good, it just lacked some salt and pepper.  On the other hand, the salad was a letdown.  The chicken was flavorless and dry, plus the prepackaged dressing did not taste good at all.
2	qd25ig2dW0cwpMi8ob6g	I reallly want to like you Moe's.  I do.  I live so close and you are sooo convenient.  BUT.... I ventured out for a taco salad last week, excited for some mexican delicousness with a side of my favorite condiment, guac.  What I got was a flavorless chicken salad with so so guac on the side.  Even my bf agreed my guac is better and not only am I not a "cook", I am also not of Mexican heritage.  I expected much much better.  Dang.  I am still looking for that authentic Mexican taste in a quick take out, and I know it's out there...
2	W9F6dpWfMIa6x11GJQsIw	So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour.
4	AopFiiAm8qUw2PUhdzqOiQ	Needed a fix and hadn't had a Sacks sandwich in a few months. It was delish and reminded me why I love their food. Today, I had a simple chicken salad sandwich with lettuce, cucumbers and provolone. Of course, I had to get an iced tea and one of their snikerdoodle cookies. I also like to get the Symphony sandwich - turkey, bacon, sprouts and cream cheese (I 86 the tomato and guac.); or the grilled cheese with a choice of cheeses; and a few friends regularly crave the Dali - egg salad.   The location on Thomas is always packed at lunch - it's really popular with the docs and nurses from St. Joseph's Hospital. Get there by 11:30 or wait until 1; or order over the phone and have it delivered (minimum 4 orders). If you do call in an order, make sure you know which of the four stores you're calling and don't forget that they're only open until 2.
4	0gHyDKxF6dgjPevvVey1A	Burgers do not get better than this! My hubby and I stopped by at 11 am today for lunch. We ordered 2 specialty burger combos. Loved being able to see our fresh food cooking. Ambiance is lacking, however, which accounts for the 4 instead if 5 stars. The dining room is not connected, so it seems kinda strange. Fries are not the best I have ever had, but the burgers are the best!
2	WZeOpKjCEdQKeSWezgEDJg	The soup (hot and sour) was the highlight of the meal. Our male server was also very nice and attentive.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch platter, and the chicken was drenched in a simple syrup sauce about 5 seconds away from being straight sugar. I absolutely hate sending things back, but I literally could not eat this dish.  I then ordered the Kung Pao chicken, and though slightly better, I would not recommend  it either.  I was really looking forward to good Chinese food after Christmas, but I did not find it here.
2	csSSJh8hTSsx5K62xyQ	K.. I don't get it.  I go there every now and then.  I have only had the pizza.  It is a step up from supermarket frozen pie.  I like it because I like frozen pizzas... but I think the ratings given are a bit misleading.    It is "cost effective" and if I think this place might be amazing for stoners..  But if you are looking for high quality pizza this is not it.  I would however get it over the chain stuff.
4	SbyiNSwLllJuZNQF4CI0jA	I have been a regular at Shootz for the past year, when I was introduced to karaoke there on Thursday nights.  The great thing about this place is that it offers enough good features for multiple types of people.    For the sports lovers, the large screen above the bar and multiple television sets are often playing the latest games.  Speaking of games, there is also a poker night.  If you like playing pool, there is an entire room of tables which offer the benefit of table side waitresses ready to bring you beer, mixed drinks, or yummy food.  If you are hungry, the kitchen is open until late (closing) with a full menu of hamburgers - though my favorite is the chicken wrap.    Of course, I go there for the karaoke. There is a stage, which serves both karaoke on Thursdays and open mic on Tuesdays.  The quality of the karaoke has a lot to do with the kj (rotates from a local karaoke jockey group) and the singers of course. There are about ten regulars and everyone is very friendly.  The only cons to the place - sometimes it gets inundated with large groups who take over the karaoke and turn it into a drunken frat joke.  Other then that - I can't complain. . .it's where I met my fiance!
4	J73rHBgfBEbZ4wqfxI4nw	fun place for breakfast and breakfast in the afternoon.  they provide delicious hot sauces to go along with the meal.  great options if you are a good Phoenician and like mexican fusion egg breakfast dishes.  great coffee and good mints on the way out the door.
2	Av0mhu6eBYN2ZboW2nP5wg	I went to Mimi's for breakfast/brunch and was diappointed.  The food was ok and the prices were a bit on the high side.  Service was decent but my expectations for this place were high and I was disappointed.
2	xFlXIll1jpPm61pB1tmSpw	Fran\u00e7ais apr\u00e8s  How can you miss pomme de terre risol\u00e9? By frying them! How can you miss Benedictine eggs ?

2	QFqhcI0rIrYhOBlbrO8Q	I wish I could have given this pizza a 5 star but even a 2 was pushing it.  I've seen this place several times off s blvd and thought i'll try it i just wanted a slice of pizza.  I ordered the sicilian cheese pizza an garlic cheese bread, my friend ordered a salad an wings with no sauce just fried.  I had my pizza and cheese bread before he got his salad, not a good sign. It took them 10 mins plus to throw some lettece , 2 tomatoes an a few black olives on a paper plate !!!  I finished my pizza an bread before his wings came, if they were busy it would have been a different story, there were less than 5 people in the whole place. Anyhoo, back to the pizza at hand, the sicilian was just some dough and cheese thrown on top not impressed.  The wings were so small and fried hard, somebody needs to teach these folks about pizza an wings.  I wont  go back, I read somebody's comment that the service was fast I had to laugh.  Heres a little extra for you, as I walked to the bathroom i'm not sure but looked like a generator in the hallway just saying.  As I walked in the bathroom I was taken back to see the toliet with no lid, now we know us ladies dont sit on public bathrooms but i found it rather odd.  But you decide for yourself if you'd like to try this place :)
4	guOAMxumE4ZBZ1ioLlIsA	I like Thai Rama.  I was tempted to give it 3 stars because I've had a lot of Thai food in the Bay Area and I've been to Thailand once, and I'm honestly not sure where I should come down on that fourth star, but since Phoenix doesn't really have quite the selection of Thai restaurants, I'll err on the side of arroy (Thai for "delicious").  I've had a few different dishes there, and they tended to be quite tasty without being Americanized.  That is, the flavors were there and not damped down for our native taste buds.    Some how we always ended up getting some yellow curry in there (one of my favorites in general), and this was just fine there.  The ambiance is pleasant and the people working there were always very nice.  I've always said that Thai people are the Italians of SE Asia in the way they enjoy food and family, and here they seem to be happy to share their culture with all comers.
2	x8azF2eApY2guBGyPcNQ	Was not satisfied with the buffalo chicken pizza I ordered from here. It was mostly a thick layer of cheese some chicken and a swirl of barbecue sauce that was on top.  It was like a candy cane. With a peppermint striped running through it. In this case, it was the sauce. This ment that much of the Pizza had no bbq flavoring.  The Pizza itself did not look all that appetizing. As it look like the chicken on it was little bits and pieces of something you would find in the trash cans located in the back of a Planned Parenthood. So not exactly visually appetizing.  I had to melt the garlic sauce,  as it came in a jelly-like congealed state.   Adding to my experiences I had ordered on line. And some how, half my order was erased. So That ment no bread sticks.  And they wanted me to include the tip during the order process. Made me think. What if my tip was not large enough?  Would I find that very special secret sauce added to my order?  Good thing was that the pizza was delivered fast and the driver seemed like a nice hard working man.  Other then that. I was not happy with them.
2	Ebkv0pjXukwJNgYS5um9w	It's ok if your hungry but taco bell tastes better. It's a buffet, so don't expect the best. Beans are dry and taste like they came from a can. Rice is bland. Enchiladas are gross. Sadly the best thing they offer is the sopapillas at the end. Drizzle with honey and your in heaven. For the price and amount of food you can get, it's ok. But if you want flavorful authentic Mexican food, keep on driving.   Also, a bit of warning. Both me and my roommate at the time, both ended up with upset stomachs after eating here. Did we eat too much? Its possible. Was it the food? probable.  Note: Please don't mistake this BUFFET place for the authentic, sit-down restaurant on Central Ave in south Phoenix. Ponchos in South Phoenix has excellent, authentic and really tasty 'home-cooked' style food.  This buffet place? Well, again, think of Taco Bell, cafeteria style.  While its not HORRIBLE, its not very good. Save your money.
4	YHWReam1Q2k1WR8SPZ0fQ	I wasn't expecting much, but to my delight I loved this place!  Beautiful views of the golf course and mountains, pet friendly patio and freshly made specialty lemonades with the option to add your favorite spirit...great idea!
2	mtVtOdcuv0y1a9wjnDS21w	I was in the mood for Salvadorian Food the closet to me was this place. I ordered the sampler being that it has a little bit of everything, I also ordered fresh water tamarindo and let me tell you it was super delicious at which I thought the food is going to be this good, after a long wait my food arrived and let me tell I was not impressed At all. It was a lot of Food, the popusas were so salty the yucca was dried the chicarones were salty as well.  I did not even dare to try the pastelitos or the other stuff I was done. The cabbage salad is my favorite well this one was warm,'did not taste good in fact it tasted as if it had been sitting there for a while. The positive thing was the  service it was descent for there only Being one waitress she was very nice. Too bad the food was not good. So I won't be back. Well maybe for a agua Fresca.
2	nRxF1UJnmcbCfGe1CY1Iw	While I give the management props for honoring our gift certificate, even though our total rang up below the minimum price, the food was teh ick.   I got the fish tacos. I understand the urge to make them unique, and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the Valley. But this attempt was a huge miss.   The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce. I was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia, and perplexed at this odd pairing. The avocados also had a funny, chemical flavor to them. Double-yuck.
4	hTHlmJYcuilkTvlj4Pg5A	It's pretty good.   One time they did have a sign in the line that said, "8 minutes from this point", like they were disneyland or something.   But the burgers are good, and the fries. and the cheesy sauce is good for dipping.
4	F31sQiGlZOsJgqyLlwcN9w	Generally speaking, I love this place. The atmosphere is tops, the space inside is huge, the decor rocks, and the food is very high quality. I didn't feel it was overpriced unless things have changed dramatically in the last year.  My friend and I went on the early side -- 5 or 6pm and we were unrewarded with Shilla's two downsides: service with attitude and a belated sushi chef. When the Korean queen who worked there came to serve us, he flung attitude at us in every which direction. I was also disappointed by not being able to order raw fish bibimbap "because the sushi chef wasn't there yet."  This is really my only complaint, however. I thought the food was excellent and unlike another Korean joint I'd recently tried across the street from Chinatown, the portions were ample and not stingy. The experience was made all the more glorious by being able to escape Las Vegas restaurant mediocrity and sink our teeth into something tasty and top notch.  Very recommended. I suggest going after 7pm to avoid "the sushi chef not being there."
4	WsXIwZV1Y6LtauVfxxMkWg	I love this place-probably the best Greek food in town and its evidenced by how busy it always is.  The family knows their customers, they have my favorite items memorized and if I get an order to go for lunch at work, they are fast and very friendly.  Very very tasty, and even better that its not a commericialized place, their advertising is stricly word of mouth.  This is a small business restaurant run very well.
2	G1JYyePi35UCkOWsMsbWA	My husband and I had lunch there as we've purchased a Groupon in November 2011. It is located in the mid of a very nice neighbourhood. First we thought the place was closed as it looked really dark. But it was open. The atmosphere is more like in a pub where you want to hang out in the evenings. And there was a workshop held in the same room that day and there were guests at another table and that was all. Many dishes in the menu card were crossed out (this didn't make a good impression to me). We've ordered burgers well done as we were asked how we'd like them to be cooked. Unfortunately they came medium and I ate it anyway but my husband just cannot eat burgers that are not cooked well done. We should have said something but we didn't. The waiter saw the plate that was almost untouched but he didn't even ask a word, which is disappointing. I think you should try to satisfy the guests if you want them to come back and try to correct things if something went wrong. Also the portion of the side which were potatoe chips was really small and with the price of over 9 Dollars for one burger and some chips I think it was totally overpriced. For me the burger was only ok. I don't know if it is more attractive to go there in the evenings and listen to live music. Unfortunately we are disappointed enough of this place to not go back and find out.
2	K0p8UnnsIgHsSE53iKO2Wg	Finally tried Hawthorne's last week after waiting a couple of years post-Mellow Mushroom.  Yawn -- really nondescript taste (though a couple of the topping combinations were quite interesting -- including pulled pork on their take on the Hawaiian pizza -- nicely done!).  No reason to pick this place when Brooklyn's is just over at Rea and Colony.
2	2zMD27ubiJEhFQKWBPjQ	The aroma of a dining place can be a great advertisement, or a way to scare people away.    This place falls in the the latter as there was a strong smell of sewage here.  Smell aside I decided to sit outside and risk my stomach to bring you this review.  We had a veggie yakisoba $6, which was a bit dry but the veggies were not overcooked. The flavor was alight but not great. We also had a veggie bowl, overly steam unoriginal veggies over white rice and an sweet sauce $4.   I was unimpressed in may ways.  The ambiance is a bit depressing. There is a ATM covered by a trash bag, that bad smell, and a menu that looks like they printed at kinks and taped it over the failed franchise that once occupied this location.
2	3cT422sxzwNNf9mJ4kvUhg	Probably the worse subway I have eaten at. The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart. Service was slow and the restroom was scary. I was very disappointed with this visit.  Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one.
2	ZGRr0aBv9qRGAXTaqskMw	I am all about service and the gentleman that helped me tonight needs a course in customer service. I walked in to make an order and he made me feel as though I was inconveniencing him! In fact he kept throwing kitchen supplies in the back and when he hung up the phone with a customer before me he slammed the phone down. Even more alarming was after I have him my order he threw the pen I used at the register. I get we all have bad days and it looks like he was short staffed-- didn't see anyone else in the back- but geez cool your jets in front of customers.  Service aside the pizza is decent and I love the Howie Maui.
4	wksd9gpuK6jgg8glzZV4Q	Rand H sent me an email the other morning about meeting here for lunch.  It was close and I could make it so I joined him.  Over the years I have liked Olive Garden pretty much.  Right now they have a never ending salad and pasta special going on for $8.95.  I make red sauces at home so I tend to get white sauces when I go out.  This time my choice was Alfredo on spaghetti which came out just as expected.  Instead of getting a second bowl of pasta I chose to make the serving bowl of salad a single serving size and only had one bread stick.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated.  It didn't take long for our waitress to show and offer us a sample of wine which I had to turn down because I was going to spend the afternoon running machinery.  The service was good throughout the meal and the staff worked as a team when they needed to.  This was my first time at this location and I would certainly return.
2	v4aaZff68qxBBvoIaVRp2A	I was recently in Phoenix for the day and stopped at the bakery (the cafe location FKA Lulu's Cupcakes) for lunch and to get some baked goodies to take home. I'd heard a lot about this restaurant (there aren't a ton of choices for us Celiacs) and couldn't wait to try it. However, my first impression wasn't great. The cafe is in a hard-to-locate dingy shopping center. Interior of the place isn't much better. Its clean, but atmosphere-free. Although they have seating and advertise themselves as a lunch spot, the clearly don't expect people to eat there - the bathroom is used partially as storage, and the only beverages available are a small selection of canned sodas and bottled water. And the food was...ok. My Reuben sandwich was tasty and on a very nice mock-rye bread, one of the better gluten-free breads I've had. But it was small (smaller than a normal sandwich I'd make for myself at home) and extremely expensive (a $9 sandwich? Really?) I also sampled the cheesecake while I was there. It was fairly tasty, but reminded me of those frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake you can buy at the grocery store; I'd accept a piece if it was offered to me again, but certainly wouldn't search it out. I also took a chocolate muffin and a chocolate "whoopie pie" home with me. Those treats again were ok, but nothing to write home about. They had an identical texture (muffins and cakes should feel different from each other) and left me with the chemical aftertaste so common to gluten-free foods. Since I can make brownies from a mix that taste better, I won't be buying any of those desserts again. I won't be going back - I can make better treats at home, and the gluten-free faire in my home town (Tucson) puts this place to shame.
2	mw2FWXWDdTnBZsDzAUPWw	My recent lunch at Del Piero was pretty lackluster. The restaurant, a small eatery inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill, the Valley's first working olive farm and mill, attracted an older crowd (people in their 40s to 60s).We even saw someone wearing  a colorful muumuu,  which served as a loud reminder that we were in the Q.C. and not the O.C.  The options at del Piero are slim -- paninis, sandwiches and salads. There's no soda fountain, but the eatery serves up iced tea, lemonade and the hard-to-find Jones flavored sodas. My panini was blah and didn't wow, but I enjoyed sampling the olive bar. Be sure to try the large olives stuffed with Feta. I could have filled up on these alone! If you're up for a road trip (it took us nearly 40 minutes to get there from Tempe!), Del Piero is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. It's  $5-$9 sandwiches, paninis and salads
2	5hyhNmP2cXFQ1ktp4moyOQ	We had brunch here with family who were staying at the Hilton. They had coupons to order off the menu,  but we paid, as there was no buffet on Labor Day.   I know I should cut them a break, because it was a holiday and we were a big group. But an hour between ordering and the food coming is just insane. It wasn't just us. I saw another table saying they couldn't wait any longer... And it wasn't just that the food took insanely long, but there were no updates, no apologies, no explanations.   When the food came, it was nicely presented and fine. Probably slightly overpriced.
4	55X78gSfOD6tuTQefxWkLA	We met friends for dinner tonight at Willy & Jose's.  Our server was a very friendly person with a fine sense of humor.  Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.  We all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.  For dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.  I'll return to Willy & Jose's.
4	zOnEsiZ4XCNh51tEmv3a9A	A nice lunch place for the downtown crowd (of which I am one) ... the place is VERY clean (rare for downtown eateries) and the prices for toasted subs are cheap (but they nail you for each add on) ...
4	drHajExERJdUoJbXFavMpg	It's not just a bakery. You can get freshly made tortillas and the best breakfast burritos in town. They're open Tues-Sat early. Lot's of Gilbert police officers eat here, so you know it's good food for a good value.  My favorite is the potato egg and cheese burrito.   Whatever group owns El Zocalo in downtown Chandler also, owns El Sol.
2	NzHSMEHOkyBMe2xXxQQEA	Had this review sitting in my drafts for over almost a year. I still remember my disappointment with this restaurant even after all this time. Besides the atmosphere and spacious outdoor seating, I was rather disappointed. The food is overpriced yet manages to under-deliver. I also found the service to be perfunctory.  If you must eat Thai food in the sun, then this will suffice. That said, if you want good Thai, go elsewhere.
4	jFV7RRzWa2ci0u18jREYsg	The food is excellent!  There is a large variety of items to choose from and you can get full meals or a la carte.  Portions are generous.  After dinner you are treated to a cup of ice cream.  The negative:  I really wish they would replace the booths.  They look like they have been there since the 50s and haven't been cleaned all that much.  Since the food is so good, and they seem to keep the place clean (they are often seen cleaning while I am there) I can only guess that it is decades of stains...
2	NunhyhvVJ1Ro77db1h4Dag	Not a good weekend for dining out, I guess.... Stopped at Byrd's for drinks after work on Friday - here's our take on it.  The place is confusing, and it would seem as though the staff is quite confused as well.  We walked in and stood at the bar for a few minutes - we weren't sure how to go about scoring an outdoor table, so we thought it best to ask.    Unfortunately, no one stopped to help us; the bartender stood on the opposite end of the bar, talking to folks.  Waitresses zipped past us without a word.  We went upstairs to check on things ourselves and it still wasn't clear if we could just grab a table.  So it was back downstairs where we flagged down a manager who told us we could seat ourselves.  Whew.  Sat at a table outside for a bit before a waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything.  We asked about drink specials - she wasn't sure if there were any; perhaps tap beers were $1 off?    We ordered a few beers.  And waited.  And waited some more.  And then we switched tables (the shade looked more inviting).  And then our beers came out and the waitress was gone.  We flagged her down for the check and waited some more.  And then we left.    Disorganized for sure.  Drinks were reasonably priced, but that's about the only positive to share.  Unlikely that we'll go back.  :-(
4	IuzjaWk1mTbndSvoziZ9Q	You can't go wrong with Popeye's.  This is the very first time I had Popeye's chicken.  My uncle took me here for a quick lunch when I went to visit.  I was quite excited since there was no Popeye's at the time in my area.  Yay for Popeye's Chicken... although I don't have it anymore because it's a bit well, greasy.
2	EqXnIfwykD3qLSTHrK3vw	God I so wish I liked this place. The inside is super clean, it's right off the Light Rail and Minority owned.  We went for Breakfast and I had scrambled eggs, Sausage, hash browns and pancakes. The pancakes were just okay, the menu said "maple syrup" and it totally wasn't real). The sausage was red and I didn't like it. The hash browns were not pre-soaked, tough and not good in the least bit.  Even Denny's is better than this.   Bummer.
2	sjaR0R6ORe52tnZ39puvqg	Visited this place on a night when they had some bands. Had a very difficult time getting attention of wait staff. Finally walked up to the bar and ordered two draft beers which ended up being close to 10 bucks. Several people - including us - tried to flag down a server and finally after about 40 minutes our orders were finished. The appetizer (an italian burrito?) was served to us still frozen inside. Soups were nothing special. Ribs were pretty good but unless you like LOTS of sauce, ask for it on the side. Bands were very good on this night. I ended up only drinking three drinks that night because that seemed to be all they wanted to sell me. Couldn't seem to get anyone's attention for more. Seems like if you are going to pay a band you want to sell the food and drinks a little better.
2	YlC93KDg2kYdSTPJQPQAA	Not too impressed with this buffet. Price wise it's pretty reasonable but personally I still don't think its worth the money for me. By all means please do not let that stop you from going. I just like more variety and better tasting food. The best thing I found was the prime tube even though there is not a lot of flavor.
4	jOwgkEdV1nAFv1kDXkfjGg	Great combo of Bruegger's and Caribou...one stop shop. Free wifi and lots of business going on inside. I think I was one of the few without a laptop that day.  The employees are friendly! This is a great Bruegger's location and you don't have to feel guilty taking a long lunch break here because you can easily bring work here. They also offer a conference room to book for those out-of-the-office-private-meetings.
2	B2q44EphIRB3QUM1fd7Gg	So the husband has taken my yelping as a mission to find new and better places recently. Going to the Copper Door was his idea, but I won't hold it against him.  On a Sunday night for dinner this place was EMPTY. Well, not completely empty, there was one other couple in the entire restaurant.  The atmosphere is beautiful: wonderful photographs of old Phoenix, a baby grand piano, and the most beautiful ceiling tiles I've ever seen (not that I make a habit out of looking at the ceiling).  We both ordered the iced tea, and it was incredibly delicious.  I have a feeling that they add just a shriggle of sugar to cut down on the typical bitter flavor of tea, without making it sweet.  As Maria F. states, the menu does claim to have vegan options.  I saw three that were labled vegan, although one contained honey.  I would doubt their understanding of what is vegan food.  Then came our meals.  Mine was the artichoke and cheese stuffed ravioli with shrimp, or at least it was supposed to be.  When the waiter brought out my dish, it was just  plate of raviolis.  I thought at first that I misunderstood, and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta.  So I tried to cut open the pasta and I had to put muscle into it.  To my dismay, no shrimp.  I told the waiter that I ordered shrimp, he looked confused and said he would be back.  He came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back.  About 10 minutes later I get the same dried-out, hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp.  The waiter said he put extra on.  Extra what?    The husband's well-done burger was medium at best.  While I was waiting for my food, he said that he had eaten better and larger burgers at Seamus's next door.  Luckily, the waiter didn't charge us the full $17 for the man's undercooked meat patty and a side of cottage cheese, just $10.  And he didn't add the $5 to my $17 dish for the shrimp, not even the extra one.  And the hostess saw us at Seamus's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience.  She was very helpful, nice and gave us a 15% off coupon for lunch which she said was very good and not as pricey.  I might give them another chance, but it won't be at dinnertime.
2	OiuM9YsqKlbYOEvB3kgTSw	I have eaten at the origin location for years...So, I was excited when they opened one on the West side of town. The first time we went the food was just as wonderful as the original location. We recently came back from a long trip away from home and was looking forward to some good Mexican food. We ordered enchiladas a side of beans...the beans were wonderful, but the enchiladas were horrible. They used to put them into a metal container and serve them smothered in enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I don't know if they were out of these containers or just trying something new but they served the enchiladas cold in a Styrofoam container. The cheese was unmelted, cold and really ruined our meal.
2	o80yxvkXC533iM7ZjI0Low	I can't say if Pirate's Fish and Chips was good or bad because it was so unforgettable which to me means it must not have been very good. I never forget a tasty fried food. I went there a while ago and was just not that impressed.  It was okay but no better than Long John Silver's, which isn't saying much.
4	OT1txDvkxc8wrtpaQVmoA	Who even knew such a good, authentic place existed way out here in the East Valley.  The place has been around for like 20 years.  The decor inside makes you feel like you're in Germany.  The wait staff was very nice and I thought the food was VERY good.  I had the sausage loaf with gravy, cabbage and these unreal home fried potatoes fried with bacon, OMG.  So good.  My date had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and potatoes.  I thought the brats were excellent as well.  They have a nice bar with a lot of German beers.  The price was not bad, 2 dinners, 1 beer was about $24.00.  Also note, their gravy is gluten-free!  Whoot.
2	tNrIuVrvzaSAzH9Ds2aEw	I am a huge sushi enthusiast and I felt like this place was missing every good cut of fish I'd normally order. The prices are ridiculous for the amount of sushi you get. The sake selection is horrible and you sit in the middle of the slots. I was not impressed.
4	Ewd8MSrIhjOsmbzkTdjOzQ	Spinach salad with chicken is my favorite food here. Add in the crab dip as an appetizer and I am a happy girl. When I lived close the the Village Tavern, I went once a week. We also loved the trout and their hamburgers. The one is Scottsdale was filled with retirees and it made me sad. It may not be a place to be seen, but for a chain, its good.
4	7FFfMDWgF9eO2ndtSnvU3g	I made a reservation here for a graduation dinner with my parents. Before dining, I was disappointed this was the only place I could find that still had openings and wished I had found something closer to campus. However, I ultimately was thrilled with my decision. So thrilled that I decided to write my first yelp review. The restaurant was quaint but still appropriately formal for a celebratory college graduation dinner. The food was great and the staff was friendly. Great find.
4	0OxNYKqhLZ5ErWNQhttAg	OK, my Pittsburgh friends pick this place for good chinese food and I see the reviews and wonder why?  But it turns out that we didn't order chinese dumplings, but vegetarian dishes and lo and behold, they are pretty good.  Eggplant with garlic was just right.  The vegetarian paradise was a huge plate and excellent.  The vegetarian yellow bird was big tofu wrapped mushrooms, although it was a bit too salty.  The ma po tofu was silken tofu and nicely hot.  The hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour enough and needed green onions.  Overall, we thought the food was good.
2	nZeIzrcK77k9dp35Nw8eFg	I'm writing this as I eat a leftover slice from a Palermo's pie (aka pizza).  Ummm...yummy.    I love the crust -- the perfect consistency of a Brooklyn pie, but slightly spicier sauce.  For those who like a sweet sauce, this may not be for you.   The  pies are reasonably priced.  The service and eat-in parlor are basic.
2	TsB9QfPTDel7jYvNY5XRvw	This used to be a great little bar and I am not sure what happened to it. My daughter has gone in 2 or 3 times now and she consistently gets bad service and she suspects it is because she is a teenager (17). They have over charged her, double charged her debit card, and just given her poor service. So I decided to go with her the other night to get a bite to eat and waitress #1 shows up, takes our drink order, then waitress #2 shows up with our drinks and says she is now our waitress. She brought our Onion Rings/Fries out cold and I had to send them back. She took forever in swinging by the table to check on us. They brought out the MOAB brownie without any spoons. It just went on and on. I never used to get service like that there and I did not recognize any of the managers that used to be there. They won't be getting any of my money in the future.
2	SgNCNoLskWBFjg7lMv7g	I was forewarned by a friend that this seemingly cute panera-esque (appearance wise) restaurant was the lemon equivalent of a car. You are hyped up to drive this beauty and then suddenly you hear a noise- it should be a warning but you decide to push along anyway and then damn it gives out- and you are stuck on the side of the road.... that sums up my experience perfectly:  Midway shopping at Trader Joes I put down the Guacamole Kit I was holding and decided I didnt want to cook- I wanted something that was already prepared...over to Zoes Kitchen I went.   Appearance-wise this place is bright- kid friendly, casual and clean.  The service was quick and friendly.  The prices seemed fairly reasonable $7-10   Upon looking at their offerings I asked myself "what type of food is Zoes Kitchen?" They seemed to be struggling on whether to be a Greek, Italian or Mexican restaurant- I say do one but do it well.   The lady at the counter recommended the chicken roll up's- served with -salsa??? I decided to give it a go- and also ordered the Pasta Salad side.  The Pasta Salad was pretty good. I didnt get a vinaigrette flavor as Krishan mentioned  but I could taste the Basil and Feta. Overall I was pleased.   The roll ups were just plain gross! They had a very mushy inside. It almost tasted like they put lettuce in there and it was all hot and soggy. I pulled out the chicken to at least try to salvage my dinner but it was hard and very dry.  I normally will just kind of finish a meal even if it's not my favorite- but this was not the case - it was inedible. Id like my $8 back ....  I don't think I would give it another shot...
4	c9T21VCQ8XLqfWNCsmTVQ	This place has the old firehouse theme nice and clean. Very friendly staff seem to live what they are doing. I got the hook and ladder. I forgot they put mayo on it I hate mayo. But I scraped it off and added mustard and hot sauce. It was quite good. I will be back here. I recommend checking this place out.
4	iIpI3PSqBBsKxFqeOzi5yg	I took the advice to come for breakfast and loved it. Service is was bright and friendly.   They have different breads depending on the day of the week. There is a mix of some great items on the menu for breakfast. Decadent items such as different omelettes, sour dough french toast, the bakers breakfast with eggs and ham. The coffee is great and the pastries are even better. The danishes and croissants melted in our mouths!   T-shirts, aprons, and tote bags are available for purchase. Pretty good quality I'd have to say. The bags also have a story behind it.
4	SgIQr7smVlHq0mfI2kKw	Went here for dinner.  Front room has a long bar and a few billiard tables.  Back room has seating for diners.  We were seated right away.  Large selection of microbrews by the bottle.  Crowd a mixture of families and students.  Enjoyed the hummus dip to start .  We had sandwiches. I had a turkey reuben and the others had burgers.  Solid, comfort food type dining.
2	9ivkvPUQy68ronPXegDq6w	J'y \u00e9tais pour un brunch et j'ai pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 : la nourriture n'\u00e9tait pas a la hauteur, le service non plus m\u00eame certains ustensiles n'\u00e9taient pas propre. Vu les bons commentaires que j'ai lu sur internet, je me dis qu'on est tomb\u00e9 sur une journ\u00e9e ou toute lequipe n'\u00e9tait pas en frome p
2	vKr6UPVzQr90LY0JsWJyVg	Yeah, 2go doesn't quite hit the spot with me. The food is too expensive and underdone to take out - you may as well eat at Delux or go get the sushi at Zen (by the way, don't, it's terrible). The deli sandwiches are nothing more than what you'd find at Safeway, for a few bucks more. The cupcakes are extremely tiny for the $3 asking price, and not so good. I'd rather hit up Tammie Coe. However, I do like their wide selection of bottled beverages.   The service here is usually horrendous. Sarcasm and bad attitude every time. Sorry that I asked for extra aioli and you forgot the first time, so I had to ask again... It's obvious the girls working this place hate their jobs - I imagine they feel a little left out of next door's happenin's.   Delux2go was a great concept, but it seems someone veered a little off course during the construction. The selection is too vast and it ends up looking sloppy. If you're going to do Delux, you're better off eating at the actual restaurant, where the atmosphere and service (not to mention you get to eat your food right off the grill) is 100% better.
4	ZG6RHCrwdqpm0tCRNIySNQ	It was a McDonald's nothing new but the faces was scared to go their when a guy said he got a burger without the meat...but no one is perfect and things happen but I did lmao it's a pretty busy place sitting in a casino that is non stop
2	10LmsiJEDtElGYtqAbb0vg	If I worked right here, I'd probably run in here frequently for a quick breakfast sandwich. They have standard basic lunch choices like sandwiches, wraps, etc. I had a mushroom burger which was just okay. This wouldn't be a place I would stop for truly healthy choices or clean foods.    The place is trying to be swanky  (wood tile ceiling, bright green panels down columns, wood quotes, etc), but it doesn't seem to be kept up well. The trim between tiles on the ceiling is rotting or dirty, the baseboard looks like it was cut by hand to accommodate the dirty outlet plate.
4	jzSXq5qs3RDOLg7Rh4dbKg	Just a good ol' neighborhood restaurant! The kind of place where people gather to chat over a meal and coffee.  Very friendly staff and quick service.  The food is good, not gourmet, but good.   I just had today's breakfast special. Chicken fried steak, two eggs, hash browns, and toast for $5.99.  My tummy is happy.
4	03zxKtUAK90k8b2S9FDJQ	If the campus Espresso Royale and the capitol Espresso Royale were sisters, the capitol Espresso Royale would be the mature older hip sister with a day job while the campus version is the popular underaged hipster wearing whatever is cool these days and probably on WUD. I appreciate the free wireless, that they take credit cards, and plethora of seating choices. I love the selection of teas, and I do not stand by the house blend but the coffee of the day often suits my palate.  The chai is fabulous and the staff on this side of State Street is WAY friendlier.
4	jKrXj4KPkGeMOnmKl4e7hg	An institution in the Stonecrest area.  Miro is a great place for a date night.  Wonderful Spanish foods (that to me seem authentic) that you can eat either as Tapas or as entrees.  Combined with a good wine selection and an attentive wait staff, Miro is a dependable favorite.
2	PRFpzD15McC3oz7UND0gkQ	I have only ordered Togo at this location since it's right next to my gym so after a good workout, I always crave some boneless wings. The two star I'm giving is for the food since every bww I have been to, the food is always good. My order always consist of some appetizer and boneless wings ( honey BBQ, Parmesan garlic, and or mango habanero). The Togo counter is not at all organized. I waited about ten minutes before getting help, when I got my food the order was done wrong so I walked back in, and wIted another ten minutes before someone acknowledges me. My box of wings was sitting sideways in the bag, the carrots and celery squished on bottom. I had to rearrange the entire bag so nothing would spill while on the drive home. For eighteen peices of boneless, i only got one small cup of ranch. Other then that, I got home and loved my food.
4	qDULJUGw045fjUDesVNb8w	Wow...you'd never believe that this place is a franchised restaurant, they hide it very well. If you're hungover on a Saturday or Sunday morning, head over to The Original Pancake House to ease your woes.  Their breakfast selection is absolutely huge, anything you can think of to have for breakfast, they have it. From pancakes, to waffles, to omelets, absolutely anything. Not only is every item I've had very good, it's also very filling. They give you very big portions for a pretty decent price. I promise you that the food here will not disappoint & you'll be heading back here again.  The breakfast/brunch crowd is always huge on the weekends, with people always waiting for tables. You may not enjoy your wait, but it's well worth it because you'll leave full & happy, without all those hangover woes.  The Original Pancake House will make you feel like you're eating at a homegrown restaurant, because the food tastes so fresh & homemade. So while it is a great place to catch breakfast/brunch in Charlotte, it is a little disappointing for me. I'd rather go to a local breakfast business to get true freshness in my breakfast. But if you're just looking for a great breakfast, with so many choices to choose from, then The Original Pancake House will definitely impress you & having you coming back again.
2	BaMr6ZvizglqPOSm9xljgg	(Filberto's + Baja Fresh) - (Cheap + Healthy) = El Gran Taquito  Yea, wasn't really impressed.  They have about 9 combos that range from $7 - $11 and they come w/ Rice & Beans but no drink.  Small drinks are $1.35.  Not expensive, but this isn't expensive food.  It's kinda cheap food.  And certainly cheap feeling atmosphere.  Now during M-F lunch they do have like 6 combos for $5.95 - but again w/ no drink.    Now to give you a picture, this place is right between the Chinese food place and, a few stores down, a pizza place, and right across the parking lot from a McDonald's. You have to REALLY be craving a taco to come here.    I won't be coming here again, but it's not like it made me sick or anything.  And the service wasn't good, but they weren't directly rude.  So, it's getting 2 stars. But just barely.
4	IZCWBC0BdWbEmc91YxDw	When we realized there was a two hour wait at Goyemon's, we decided to grab a brew at PT's (just down the street) while we waited.  One in our party needed a quick bite, and before we knew it a large platter of eye-pleasing nachos was delivered to us as lounged on the couches.  Tri-colored tortillas chips provided an aesthetically pleasing backdrop for an abundant array of juicy,tasty tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, at least two kinds of cheese I believe, a generous serving of guacamole and sour cream, and even more than I can remember.  I struggled with deciding between three or four stars because the building and interior are worn and energy just felt a bit tired.  But every time I think about the cold brews on tap (I had a Fat Tire) and the scrumptious nachos, I realize I've got to give them props.  They are a pub and they do it well!  Based on this experience, I'll keep PT's in my list of go-to places when a group of us wants to hang out.  Cheers!
2	vpqvfL8LW9xiBWxOeimnQ	Two things keep me coming back to this place: 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesday at lunch and the staff,    Hennessey's is one of the few real bars in downtown Vegas -- which is casino-centered.  It sells itself as an Irish Pub, but comes off with more of a Bennigan's vibe.  The prices are pretty steep for the mediocre quality of the food, but cut those prices in half for 2 for 1 burgers and its worth a visit.  Beyond that, the only real reason to visit is to catch sports on a big screen tv outside of a Fremont Street casino.  The customer service is pretty solid and the servers do a good job keeping the customers happy.
4	ijlewyWclqKlrXiPYOYcdA	YC's is a do-it-yourself Mongolian BBQ.  You just grab a bowl and start throwing the mixin's.  There is a wide variety of meats and veggies, noodles, etc.  You even mix your own sauce.    I had only been here once before (at the Scottsdale location) and made a rookie mistake of not adhereing to the recommended portions as far as mixing sauce goes.    My meal ended up tasting like a bowl of melted twizzlers, but it was no one's fault but my own.    This time I got it right though, and at $7 (lunch) for the meal its not bad (pack lots of food on your bowl!  It "shrinks" when it is cooked).  You can even pay an extra dollar and even go at it all-you-can-eat style, but I have never personally progressed past the first serving....(I think there is also free frozen yogurt, but again, always too full).
4	jgcC85upY6iQoygqWOK0Q	i love filiberto's. as a hispanic American i think the good is pretty authentic for a chain restaurant. the only thing different locations vary in quality of food. this one is always busy which in my experience means the food will not be old, cold or overcooked. the only problem i've had with this location is that sometimes you can wait for a long (sometimes really long) time for your food. if you are in a hurry be aware of that...
4	bNUpWvhcJZ4VXK6j4HVKA	this is a really cool mom & pop diner.  i say cool because it's better than the run-of-the-mill denny's or so. order "the southerner" it has biscuits and gravy... their specialty. You'll find old timers and a young crowd. it's chill. don't expect fancy or great. it's what you make it. ps. i love the coffee here
4	LqbkrBeW1ZxVVzBvYswQ	Nestled away northwest by Santa Fe Station is Bob Taylor's Ranch House. It's  very rustic and has an old west feel. The meat they use is Angus and it's grilled over an open fire. I had the Shrimp, which were nice and broiled. The rack of ribs....mmmmm Oh and my favorite was definitely the steak. Not overly seasoned. It tasted like how meat should be. There's a 32 oz  steak they have that I've been wanting to go after. But I just haven't gotten around to it. Soon Mister Bob Taylor...I will consume your 32 oz of meat....Mwahahaha - Good white people food.
2	WqCckaQ2RHeYekbsYEVuw	Oh no, a breakfast place that doesn't know how to make an omelet?  For shame.  Oh no, a restaurant staff that doesn't care if you enjoyed your meal, even worse.  It's really too bad because the first time I went here the place was decent, it's why I decided to make a return trip, even though it's not technically in my 'hood.    I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.    What was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.  I won't be back.
4	m0vwiw9lgTjepUzD2PRxIA	I ended up meeting a friend on the east side of town for dinner a few nights ago.  Since my wife isn't a huge fan of seafood we tend to go to all the places my wife doesn't like when we catch up.  My friend suggested sullivans pier, we used to go there years ago for fish and chips.  The restaurant seems to have moved or opened a new location on Southern Ave.  Nothing much for decor, seems to be a former burger king.  We were both drawn in by the coconut platter.  1 side, 2 HUGE coconut shrimp, and 2 big pieces of coconut whitefish for around $8. we also shared some friend mushrooms.  The shrimp were fairly fresh and tasty, the tropical sauce they server with the paltter is very good.  the fish were crispy and satisfying, and I tend to be a bit of a purist with fish and chips usually just Malt vinegar, and a lemon wedge, occasionally tartar sauce. The last time we had seafood together we went to Red Lobster and were underwhelmed with about the same amount of food except it cost around $60 for two.  I only wish I had something like this on the westside of town.
2	woqFJAJn1m1fp8d7tZrn4A	Let's start by saying that I have been to New Orleans a few times, so my standards are higher than most.  I think our friend Babs needs to stop using Sysco brand food and start working with higher quality ingredients.  She also should concentrate on the dishes she is best at.    We had the red beans and rice, with sausage as one of our dishes.  The temperature of the dish was not hot enough.  The beans weren't spicy.  The other dishes just lacked that "umph" that you get in NOLA.  Even here in Wisconsin, we should be able to produce food that has a little pizazz!  The spicy shrimp I got weren't even browned.  They just had some sauce on them.  It wasn't good.  Period. Frankly, I would recommend driving to Milwaukee and hitting Crawdaddy's if you want a taste of New Orleans.
4	eZrso1ddPcpIaIOCF3sOQ	I'm not a bar person, and I'm not a Scottsdale person - but I freaking love this place.    This has been a designated hang out spot many times.  Many times.  And it always hits the spot.  Just enough Cool, a heaping helping of laid back, a splash of irony and garnished with some decent tasting and decently priced Mexican food.  Yea, the food is garnish.  I mean really, would you come here to eat?  That said, I can speak highly for the tacos and the nachos because those are often our things to get.    I love the Mexican beach theme because since becoming a designated adult I get down there much less that I'd like to go - so I have to take what I can get.    Folks are normally pretty cool there too.  Every once in awhile you get some folks who walked in a bit too sauced already or feel like they should be a higher level of customer or something - but it doesn't happen too often.  That and the fact that it still gets pretty freaking hot there during the summer - even with misters - keeps it from 5 star glory.  But on a great weather kind of day - there's nothing better.
2	sUYRXgshKVIU2qERQpOy9w	Well- it's a subway. So the the standard sandwiches and services apply. I have never had bad service or food here- but the restaurant down on 43rd ave and Bell is generally cleaner, and the staff is a bit more friendly and outgoing.
2	OZ8Kt8hMGp64c4qNt889eQ	In N Out tastes like every other fast food joint. Bland thin burger, bland thin fries, bland thick shakes with a high loogie factor. I couldn't even finish my chocolate shake (blasphemy!!!!), it was just so... boring. It tasted more vanilla than chocolate. I don't find the secret menu all that exciting.... it's pretty much just a bigger stack of stuff they've already got on the menu. So what? Fast food is gross.   And yet... all these 5 star reviews. Perhaps there's some kind of hormone that In N Out puts in their food, cooked up in a diabolical Christian laboratory, that affects 99.9% of the population. And somehow I am immune. To quote a great man, the designer of the piano-key necktie: "Doesn't anybody notice this? I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!"
2	TgNYi9CPJitMCnm0yK37A	My Super Nachos were really good, minus the cheap liquid cheese.  I ordered two regular burritos which turned out to be filled with air, not meat and other good stuff.  They were meagerly constructed and filled leaving me to really not want to go back there again.  They're even stingy on their hot sauce....at least robertos gives you an abundance of hot sauce!
2	wlMtC9OEue3TogZ6BWogdw	Oh airport food, always sad . . . .  Plenty of seating in this colorful cantina.  The sports play on the big screens and the waitresses are pretty quick and friendly.  A simple menu makes it easy to order - we decided to split the big blue burrito.  It really is huge!!!  The steak was dry, not very flavorful, the tortilla seemed dry too and overall it was a sad bland burrito.  Comes with light fluffy chips and a bland salsa too.  Tons of food for about $8 - so it's a good deal but just not very good food.    Our waitress was fairly attentive and made sure we had what we needed.  Overall the service was nice but not amazing.  I don't blame her though.  I also didn't like that they had the super cheap plastic cups and plastic utensils.  Eh .. . . .
4	uz3AGMH9oaboScJXtVM7jg	Amazing comfort food in all respects--comforting food in a chill, comforting environment. Cool artwork on the walls, nice layout of tables and the bar, and an amazing food. If you're up for a mellow night with friends, this place is perfect.   Last time I was here we started out with deviled eggs--something I'd never really seen on the menu before I moved to Charlotte but which is ubiquitous here. There's a reason for this. Try one. Or a lot.   The rest of the menu offers good bar-type food and things like burgers, fried chicken, mashed potatoes--you know, real-deal comfort food that you'd expect. In all honesty, where you're done eating you'll wanna go right to sleep--which is the point, right?
2	zF0pGvoajkMlFR1YNwTWg	I really wasn't a fan of Einstein's, but it's location inside the Hyatt was great. Very convenient for a quick breakfast if you're staying at the hotel. The coffee I had was good, but a few times during our conference, they ran out of coffee in the mornings, probably due to high demand.
2	2KhDsShyc5ch2bHy1GWpA	My wife and I were anxious to try this place. Big letdown. Overpriced, and not that great... Borderline bad.  Try at your own risk. If your expecting anything authentic and good, go elsewhere.   Try Giacomo's Italian Restaurant on E. Mallard Creek Rd.    Look them up...
4	r1k9nZSjJKKj9HoUDbexw	Was very impressed by this place. Yes, I've lived in Texas and like "that kind of food," but it was quite tasty. Had a burger and their guacamole, and both were very good. Good service. I'll be back.
2	2OQHQiYOStzCaBUOQgfJA	It's right by where I work so is convenient. The decor and efforts to make it look Irish are top notch. Here's why it gets 2 stars:  1. Teach your staff how to pour a Guinness or go and actually spend some time in Ireland to realize the importance of this or at least Google/YouTube a correct pour. One pour with a head full of bubbles and a head ranging from 2mm - 2 inches is not acceptable. If the owner (who's not Irish) is going to run a business and profit from our traditions and culture at least take the time to learn something about the country.  2. Irish Breakfast should be just that - not some attempt with not even close to an Irish sausage, no rashers, beans etc . The other attempts at traditional Irish food are ok - Shepherd's Pie, Stew etc.  3. Service can be very hit or miss. Never fantastic but often times it is absolutely terrible.  4. Finally. A lot won't understand why this is a big deal - I suggest search the net. There's a Happy "Patty's" Day ornament in the cabinet on the right when you walk in.   Suggestion - hire a manager/senior bar person who is Irish or has spent a decent amount of time bar tending in Ireland and listen to their advice. Most of the problems are easily fixed.   *EDIT - I nearly forgot about this!! To add insult to injury after point 4 above, this is on their menu:  An Broc Angus Beef Burger** Certified Black Angus Beef Paddy, Choice of Char or Flat Top Grilled. Served on Your Choice of Our Guinness Roll or Sesame Wheat Bun  GRRRR!!
4	fpTxwKGmSitrM0MxOJM6Q	If you are ok with hole-in-the-wall local Chinese places, this one is great. Typical deal... run down place, same person all the time, etcetera, etcetera. The food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are good. This is not gourmet fare though, fairly typical american style Chinese fare.The people are always nice, and once you call a few times, they know you.   If you are in the neighborhood and want a quick-fix, by all means get take-out from there. They don't deliver, and the place is run-down, so why not take the yumminess home and watch some TV?
2	O5bnJjonNynz4wRac6OqA	Don't be fooled by the designer's touch and the great service. You're here for the food and the food is mediocre at best.  Orange Peel Chicken: we asked to substitute chicken for beef. What did they do? Threw a bunch of breaded chicken in a beef sauce. Imagine putting chicken in your mouth and tasting beef.  Kung Pao Chicken was way sour and dulled down.  Cury Crab Potstickers were good.  Overall, a mediocre meal for $60. Keep walking. There are better places at Mandalay Bay.
4	eGYRmlaUPlWmrp2CweqOQ	I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain.    I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had "reserved" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy.   The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise.   The food is best described as "home cooking". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland?   Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.
2	jbHj7wRSW8hK1vDWIbJElA	I really hate this place.   As much as I enjoy wings and think that they have a good selection of sauces, the service is always such a turn off at this location. Every time we are there, regardless if they are busy, we get the slowest service ever. Drinks go unfilled, mistakes are made with the orders, and you start to feel forgotten in general. It really should not take an hour and a half to eat at a place that 99% of their menu is fried and served in paper boats. Not to mention the fact that they charge for ranch dressing ($.40). Last time a mistake was made in our order it almost turned into an argument with the waitress who eventually pulled the manager over. We asked for boneless and got bone in- it should of been a simple fix not a confrontation.   My husband continues to want to go back so I guess I will continue to begrudgingly go back.
2	0vFEq5AQH4ST0BWaGRT0A	This place reminds of a poor mans Benihana..."where dinner is the show". The entrainment factor of watching a chef juggling prawns is over shadowed by the fact the they taste terrible. As another reviewer said its a good idea to go to Fuji if your in a large group mainly for the entertainment factor. Save your money and skip Fuji.
4	brQIzaqdAHa0k63K9Jfg	This bar was a lot of fun! I loved the cheap/reasonably priced drinks, I loved the diverse crowd. I can't speak for the food since I ate elsewhere before the bar but overall atmosphere gets 5 stars. One thing I would like to say, this place needs to check who they allow to play live music in there. The guys who played Saturday 3/1, Kevin Marshall and Scott Sutton, were incredibly racist and made no qualms about it in their songs. I'm a white guy and I was extremely offended by their ignorance. If you read this, Big Al's, don't let these a-holes play in your bar anymore. Also, they were way too loud. Good bar for a night out with friends, just check the schedule for live music and make sure the aforementioned "musicians" aren't there.
4	1Joj4ufvLQ76WNV73rjd6Q	A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.
4	0K1vV45QTb8rsMxQ99QSow	I have been a fan of Red Rocks for a long time. The service is always good and the food is consistent and good. My biggest complaint is that the red wine is always served too warm and I finally figured out why. They keep their bottles on top of the bar refrigerators. The heat from refrigerators warms the red wine enough that I usually have to put in an ice cube (not what I want to be doing.)   They now have a big beautiful outdoor seating area.
4	18nz5VLQaQZgd9jDj6973A	My new office by Deer Valley Airport and the food truck drove by for 3 days before I went in for a try.  Pretty darn good. Had 2 steak tacos (street style) that were very good.  One chicken taco that was tasty, just not really my style.  Will try the pork next.  They have several really great salsas. Will be eating here a lot!
2	6LcVcQOgEutitNWwcbKgag	Went to the Mint Hill location for lunch today (Sunday).  I was looking forward to it since Hawthorne's always gets high marks in reviews and polls.  However, I was a litte cautious since we were going to the one in Mint HIll and not the original in Elizabeth's.  We ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza and a New Yorker Cheese pizza and kid's chicken fingers.  The service was good.  I was not impressed with the pizza.  One thought was that the pizza was under cooked, because one side of pizza the cheese was cooked and the other side it was not cooked all the way. Though the dough seemed cooked. I think the bigger reason was more the sauce on the cheese pizza.  It that had a tin can after taste to it and it didn't taste like a homemade sauce.  Even my 10 year old didn't like the cheese pizza.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza did have a little kick to it which is surprizing since it really is hard to get spicy in Charlotte.  The negative part about the pizza was that the chicken on top was diced chicken that probably came in frozen.  I was expecting that the chicken should have been breaded and cooked at the restaurant. I liked the atmosphere of the Mint HIll location, however I will give the chain one more chance but will go to the Elizabeth location instead.   The kids did like the chicken fingers and the waffle fries.  The waffle fries were nice and crispy and had a good flavor.
4	GPsTu5p6m7E1wjshX2hQ	I do love their rotisserie chicken the most.  I am not a huge fan of all of the sides.  I also do a lot of catering here for work lunches and they do a really great job at that.  Good option for fast, non fast food, just watch out for the sides...
4	DO8xRzGJyODqMBjJ2zqDA	My wife and I were here today for probably the 400th time.  Come here at least twice a month without fail.  Never thought to post a Yelp for whatever reason until now.  The owner came by our table, as he usually does as he makes the rounds and checks on the patrons.  He happened to mention how there were a couple reviews that were really bad and how disappointed he was that someone would have had such a bad experience.  By the number of visits, its easy to tell we really like the place.  The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. From the pizza to the sandwiches to the soup to the fresh baked cookies, we've tried it all and it's delicious.
4	bbmcJ6x7WPIlAC6gcNYqjQ	One of my favorite places to go to get Chinese. This location makes a mean General Tso's and chicken fried rice. Portions are pretty good. If you eat inside the place is always clean. Thought the drive up window was stupid at first, but it is nice to have. If you are looking for "fast food" Chinese, this would be the place. Just wished I still lived on this side of town.
2	KYbUrCqUfFAJ0ozTRRdGQg	I took Melissa's car to the dealer for service today.  After a few hours sitting in the waiting room and listening to light hits ranging from Kelly Clarkson to Enrique Iglesias my stomach began to grumble.  I perused the vending machines and initially considered going with the BigAZ Bubba Twins\u2122 Chili Dogs until I came to my senses and decided to venture out into the world in search of sustenance.  Across the street I spied what looked like ancient adobe dwellings.  As I got closer a sign indicated that it was the dilapidated ruins of Pappago Plaza.  Through my explorations of the prehistoric temple to the gods of home furnishings and strip mall bars, I was drawn to both the British Open Pub and the Hometown Buffet next door, but neither was right for a meal before noon.  Just as I was about to give up on my quest I spied a single word that drew me in...PIZZA.    As I walked closer I noticed the magic words..."2 slices for 3.99" and I was sold.  I entered the tiny hut and it appeared to be empty.  After a few seconds the phone rang and a tiny Italian man stepped out from behind a door.  He answered the phone and spoke something I didn't understand in a thick Italian accent.  After hanging up he asked me what I wanted, at which point I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of pepperoni and a Pepsi.  After giving him my $5.27 he retreated behind the door from which he came and I took a seat at one of the 2 tables in the cramped and poorly maintained hut.  After a few minutes he returned with my slices.    The slices were good size, but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust.  I went in search of spices (a must for any good Pizza joint) and found only red pepper and parmesan.  Disappointed, I started with the cheese slice.  It was a bit on the chewy side, sort of like a poor man's Hungry Howie's, but was very bland and without the flavored crust.   As for the pepperoni, they were limp and soggy and tasted like some dog treats smell.   By that I mean it's intriguing to the point where you almost want to eat it, but you know it's not a good idea.  Luckily they were easily removed to convert it back into another bland cheese slice.  The best part was probably the crust, which was soft and tasty and could have been great with the right dipping sauce.    I returned from my quest having not discovered any hidden treasure, but at least alive and with a full stomach...which is more than I can probably say if I had gone with the chili dogs!
2	gEs0mA2xJ5PqJXyyOAx2Vg	The pizza is mediocre at best.  I've been here a couple times for the UFC fights and have tried a couple of their pizzas.  As I said, mediocre at best.  I have also tried their calzones.  That was just a greasy disaster...
4	nifw3GcXt6jJIa1yHnoiCg	Prommares is the second of two Thai restaurants I decided to revisit after having my appetite for Thai food stimulated by reading a discussion in the Talk forum.  I went to Prommares with the same friend as I had taken to Basil 'n Lime.  Here we ordered an appetizer because the cost was so reasonable -- 5 veggie egg rolls served with sweet & sour sauce for only $3.99.  I knew that rice was a separate charge here, so I was prepared to order it with our entrees, but I didn't have to.  After we placed our orders, our waitress added "a pot of rice" to the order for us, and it turned out to be a generous pot of rice.  I ordered the same entree here that I ordered at Basil 'n Lime, Chicken Panang -- which is my favorite Thai dish.  The waitresses at both restaurants asked me how spicy I wanted the Panang on a scale from 1 to 10, and at both places I chose 5.    Here, at Prommares, I thought the Panang was a little better.  It was less sweet and a little spicier and richer with flavor.  Very delicious.  My friend ordered a spicy chicken and eggplant dish at a 10 on the spiciness scale.  I had a bite of hers and loved the flavors.  She definitely enjoyed it.  As others have pointed out, Prommares is a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  It's located in the same strip mall with the Good Will store.  The interior is quite small with just a few tables.  The unisex restroom  was clean, but you have to walk through the back of the kitchen to get to it, and the toilet seat doesn't stay up on its own.  I think the location and the small size are a con; however they are probably responsible for another pro, which is the very good prices.  Our bill here came to $22 and change, only two bucks more than we paid at Basil 'n Lime, where we didn't order an appetizer.  So if you minus the four dollar appetizer, our bill would have been two bucks less at Prommares, even though we had to pay two bucks for rice.  Seen in that light, I don't mind in the least being charged separately for the rice.  It's just a different way of doing things and their prices come out better anyway.    So overall, I give Prommares a small edge in taste and price, while I give Basil 'n Lime an edge in location and atmosphere.  I will definitely return to Prommares as well.
2	nLcRMYrvhbMD5wj4BRoLw	One thing I forgot to mention - although the food was barely "OK", their hot sauce was quite delicious.  Very flavorful and good heat to it.  Yum.  Now if only their food was good enough to put the hot sauce on...
2	E6GOWoBaOpCHlSOEnUqlUg	The chicken wings are delish but the service is very slow.  Came here 3 times so far with 3 different servers. . .nothing the same.  The fist waitress took our order and then 20 mins later came back and said that the "computer" had a hiccup and didn't take our order and she threw away the original paper she took our order on.  So did that mean we waited 20 mins for nothing?!  The second time, the waiter was very friendly and prompt. . .well let me rephrase that, he worked as quickly as the kitchen allowed.  Oh but he forgot the soup.  Now this third time that I'm drafting the review now, the server didn't bring a straw for my son's drink.  We asked for it and he said he would get it now, asked again and then again until we finally got it.  15 mins after I get my hot chocolate he asks if I wanted whipped cream for it.  Once again, the server forgot food.  This time it was our short stack.  Service is always slow.  Hostess said it would be a 20 min wait for us to be seated but more than half the seats were empty.  They need a lot of improvment to live up to Green Valley's standards.  If the food wasn't ok we wouldn't have been back 3 times.  The only reason for the second star is because of the food quality and taste.  0 Stars for service!
2	EGl08Maun6KqghU8Du7XfA	I went there for the first time a little while ago with my brother. The place was dead at dinner time so we should have known to turn around and go somewhere else. But nope we wanted to give it a try. We both had the AYCE. Sushi was not good, too much rice, not enough fish. Appetizers were not good either..ordered fried tofu and they gave me a full plate of not fried but soggy tofu...enough tofu to fill anyone up. I guess they didn't want anyone to order anything else....so wrong. I'm surprised this place is not out of business yet.
4	z2Pr5RLcFRYQcPuzA8FXw	I can't believe the less than great reviews for Pamela's.  I also can't believe that I've never reviewed this place before, despite it being right around the corner from me.  Well I woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast.  So borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine, I decided to take my guy out to eat.  Well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes.  Carbs!  Calories!  Fat!  (Mmmm, just thinking about that--Pump that insulin Susan!  Pump!).    Well I am a type-1 diabetic and even though I opted for the slightly less carb-a-lish-ous pancakes and an egg on the side, I still was pumping that insulin 'cos their 'cakes are s-o-o-o-o good!  The menu even bills them as The Devil's Carb Corner!  Hey, a girl can't eat just scrambled eggs all her life!    A couple of things though.  Pamela's does have a lunch menu, but they don't serve these on Sunday.  Also the place is "CASH ONLY" so be sure to stop at the ATM beforehand.
2	4CueCTH919qyS6Ftgxiuzg	I only go for the prime rib. Haven't had any other dish The first time i came here was before they relocated to their newly remodeled location. The service was so terrible that I didn't return for over 4 years.  When i did return after about 4 years the food was..... decent. It wasn't fantastic, you're only paying $14 for a 10oz prime rib so I guess you get what you pay for. They try to have a fine dining environment with dimmed lighting and serving your food off carts and stuffing your potato in front of you. I've visited the newly located and remodeled Cortez room twice now and both times the service was not terrible, the people were very friendly, but it was VERY VERY SLOW. Expect to be waiting, and waiting.  Something i don't like about this place is if you're using a credit card, they make you fill out the receipt first.. tip and all and sign it before they swipe your card. I don't like that at all. I think it slows the process down [with the already slow service] and I like to keep my tips a mystery until I leave.  It'd rather have prime rib from the Red Rock Casino cafe than this place. Cheap and Good. The waiters suck. The bussers are awesome. Overall the food is pretty acceptable for the price, but the service continues to be poor over the years [5/7 visits were poor service] Expect a long meal time. Make reservations on weekends.
4	IkSoPrCIbC3dtQqkZs1w	It's a little pricey in my opinion, but the Common Market is one of the greatest places to find some interesting vegetarian lunch foods in Charlotte.   I enjoy their barbeque tofu, and they've got some fantastic sandwiches. The whole she-bang will usually run you around $7, which is expensive when you think you could get the same deal from Subway for significantly less...but you feel better in your soul when you eat local!   Common Market is near Yoga One, which is where I get my downward dog on, so I find myself over there a lot. The staff is friendly, the wine and beer selection is top-knotch, and the food is good.  Another of my favorite parts of this shop is their little weird toy section. I have a stretchy, squishy, sticky red pig that I keep in my kitchen window that came from there, and also a set of unicorn action figures emblazoned with the Russian hammer and sickle vs. one with the US flag pattern. Where do they find this stuff?
4	OZoFtx3OPubhaIcq3WkQ	I grew up in the Bay Area eating Round Table Pizza and as a result I am biased. To this day I still think RTP is the BEST pizza you can get - from a pizza chain restaurant anyway. The prices are a little higher for a pie here compared to other chain's - but like anything - you get what you pay for. The toppings are fresh and flavorful, and the bake is just right for my tastes. My favorite pie here is half and half King Arthur's Supreme/Wombo Combo. Ill take an RTP pie ANY DAY over Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Murphy's, Little Caesars, etc!
2	5mdlqWbgVM6g67KIgypVw	Meh. You know it's nothing special when no one working there is of the ethnicity the food is meant to be. It was a confusing experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Being from Reno, NV, I've experienced some awesome buffets in my time. This is not one of them. I'm sad that I wasn't impressed by this place, since it's within walking distance of my house.
2	Jitqtd8cbaIyZVZuq2Jg	I hate the all-day music here... it's the WORST place to do work/have a conversation.  I don't like the dark back room. I don't like the way it's hard to plug in your laptop. I just don't really like it here.  The coffee/service/food is good, though. I just can't stand the rest of it.
2	GbvvgrUrcWCr4jltiZCvcw	I was driving by and saw this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The meat was tender and quite tasty but all 3 of the BBQ sauces that they had were bad. I love good BBQ and to me and my husband, the sauce is a huge part of the meal. I'm sorry to say that we won't be going back anytime soon, even though the price was right.
4	BWov9vNFot5ZbFsRxvxDQ	THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED  And it's a real shame. I would order from Pizza Amier at least once a month, despite the occasional rude interaction with whoever answered their phone. A note in their window says they will reopen at a new location in the future, but no date or time frame is listed.
4	WU27df1zACtkaJlea3Piw	Went for Porn in the Morn. The most distracting breakfast I've ever had!   Food: Denver omelet was okay. The hashbrowns were a bit mushy for my liking. Omelet was decent.   You go here for the experience of eating breakfast and watching porn. You can't be in a bad mood here! Definitely worth checking out!  4 for the experience. 2 for the food.
2	fMb1iXUBGhUsja7gALTxhg	There is another listing of this eatery place here on Yelp!  I am aware of this place for the past 10 years. I rarely bought stuff here... the displayed cooked dishes looked ordinary.  I went for BBQ pork today. I asked the butcher for one pound of meat. I asked her to pick the lean meat from the stacks.  She made a bad mistake and not shy about it. Even though she has picked a piece already more than 1 lb, she sneaked in another leftover piece and charged me accordingly. Finally tally was 1.33 lbs.  I have seen butchers picked meat to make over the requested weight, but they never added more on purpose.  By the way, the cut of meat is fatty even though I asked for lean meat. I believe all the meats were fat to start with.  So shoppers, this is a dishonest behavior. If it can happen to me, it will happen to you too. Heed my warning. BEWARE!!!!!
4	yCNJ2ivzwM1sbfbwqYo9QQ	Definitely a break from the usual Subway or Jimmy Johns.  They have an expansive sandwich menu and on top of it, they're good.  The bread is awesome, even when toasted.    The only drawback was that it took a long time to get my order, but then again, it's probably because I went at the height of lunch rush.
2	NaJcBcS3swzRN0FSxpL7g	Karoke night was fun to watch. Two bartenders, one guy and one girl. The girl was terrible. You had to flag her down to get a drink everytime. It became the talk of the bar. Good place to stop for one drink but not good enough to hang for the night.
4	oY8XxglshjjtwIPSx4ug2w	Woohoo!  Haven't done a "first to review" in a while on here.    Nied's is a Lawrenceville institution - in business since 1941.  They're known for their fish sandwiches, which are okay as far as taste goes and humongous, and I mean really humongous.  The only have IC beers, too.  Ambiance is very dive, but the staff is very friendly and service is great.  (I haven't seen much of the supposed "nice" out of locals since I moved here a couple of years ago, but Nied's embodies it.)  Keep in mind: this is four stars for a place that is very much a dive.  It's well above average for what it is and what they're trying to be, but it's not what you'd be looking for a little further down Butler.
2	80WHhtg2rdFfoaqJEBxLw	I'm in town for the weekend and came here based on the previous reviews.  Well the previous reviews are obviously from people who work there because this place is just AVERAGE.   I go to NYC. A couple times a year and this place is far from authentic NY PIZZA.  My GF and I both ordered pizzas(I had thin crust and she had thick crust) and they were nothing to write home about. The crust taste like cardboard,  ingredients were ok,  and sauce was ok.  Checkin on airtran waitress was great and my Caesar salad was good.
4	3RG66kDUBgZEjKzk02qhsA	I am a big fan of this place.  While I haven't been there before 10pm and I don't necessarily go there for dinner, it is a great place for cheap beer and free pizza on the weekends.  Yes I said that right, Friday and Saturday night's from 10p - 12a it's a free pizza buffet and $1.50 drafts (used to be $1, but I'm not complaining).  They bring out 4 pizzas at a time to the buffet area and they get cleaned out pretty quickly, so make sure to take more than 1 slice at a time if you have a hearty appetite.  They're also a little slow at bringing out new pizzas, but if you plan accordingly, you can definitely get stuffed.    I haven't tried any of the other foods, and after reading the other reviews I think I will stick with $1.50 drafts and free pizza.  But the price is right, the beer is cold, and the pizza is good.  Can't go wrong here.
4	opqLNqO0K6uAeOPpd5ttQ	Came here to figure out where I stood in the Mediterranean Grill v. Aladdin's debate.  Conclusion?  I'm still sitting on the fence, but I'm okay with that.  I like them both.  I ordered the falafel pita wrap here, which I've also eaten at Aladdin's.  The falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good--crunchy on outside, but not dry on the inside.  I'd say it's crunchier here than at Aladdin's.  Two things I prefer about Aladdin's falafel wrap are: the toasted pita and it seemed better wrapped (the Mediterranean Grill one fell apart sooner in my hands).  But, still, all in all, the falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good.  The wrap comes with the usual lettuce, tomato and tahini--nothing out of the ordinary, like the pickled vegetables that Aladdin's adds (which I very much like), but I was plenty satisfied.  The food and beverage selection is smaller than Aladdin's, but it's a smaller establishment, so I wouldn't hold it against them.  (In response to an earlier review: they don't have a hot mint tea, but their iced tea is mint).  The ambiance is weird here, but there's also something cool about trundling down those stairs to the basement and feeling like you know about a hidden gem.
2	MfPXGFpSZOK4aEIidjMOQ	This is like a glorified walmart food court which they discontinued for a reason! Place is dirty and the back family room smells of urine so can i say not real appetizing. Food is plentiful and of a large variety but the atmospere is dirty, which always makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.
4	AGhINqKd7l5A1XQM7jV8Vw	My Hubby has been coming here since he was in High School.  We have been coming here when we are in the area since he introduced me to it.  I love this place.  It has a comfortable, welcome kind of feel.  It is clean.  We have nice service, especially this last time... The pizza I was handing to my ten year old jumped off the plate into his lap, right on his new cool shorts... They made him a new plate of the lunch special :) I ordered a special, it was SOOOOOO good, but this is the only complaint I have... They charge a dollar for each extra topping on only two slices of pizza, a buck each is too much.  I ended up eating a ten dollar slice of pizza... but it was good!! The wings are the bomb diggity for real, they are fried right and tossed in the sauce and come out cooked perfect, juicy plump chicken with crispy skin... MMMM!!
4	ntRq2KqWoWxmWRtcLATRA	Went to have dinner Wednesday night.  It wasnt busy and we were seated right away.  We had the best server ever...Kristin!  Since it was my first time there, she explained how to order and made suggestions depending on what i liked.  She was attentive and checked up on us to make sure we were ok.  Oh yah, we were fine and happy with our crab!  The food was good and for sure I'll be back for more next time.  What I especially liked was how Kristin chased after us to return my friends daughter's ring and bracelet she had left on the table.  I thought that was cool.  Thanks Kristin...youre the best!
4	Qulx01pskU2z1UgtrXqSg	Food is the same.  Prices are the same.  What this place has that most don't are the people.  The staff always make the difference and the young man that was at the register was soft spoken but patient and smiling.   Glad to stop in at an LJS and not regret it, for once.
4	qf6EC90CAkaJrvELHo4ckA	This is my go-to diner, what I call lovingly the "punk rock" diner, because it seems to always play punk music.  Everything about this place is what you should expect from a lovely little greasy spoon next to a tattoo parlor.  The booths, the wood paneling on the walls, the seats at the bar, and all the accompanying kitsch.  The food is what you'd expect from a greasy spoon, so if you're expecting something upscale, go down the street to Sardine or whatever.  But if you want a solid breakfast or brunch for under $10, this is exactly the place.  The omelets are particularly good -- I'm a big fan of their bomblet and the spanakopita.  The service is lovely; the place is never particularly busy and the wait staff doesn't give you a lot of indie-holier-than-thou lip.  Bring a book, the morning paper, or a few friends.
4	Oi9f6LLrt06XEG0UjY8Apw	I've had food from Ali Baba before (lunch meetings and the like), and it's always been good, so tonight I went here for dinner with friends. While most dishes don't stand out as being better then other Middle Eastern restaurant, everything is good.   We got hummus (lots of paprika and fennel, little oil), vegetarian grape leaves (standard, but always a fav), Fatoosh, spinach lentil soup, spinach pie (amazing), the fish entree, and a chicken entree. I didn't try either of the meat dishes, but everyone was really happy with what they got. All of this, six beers (they have no wine or liquor, you're welcome to bring your own bottle), and two desserts was $68. Total steal!   The desserts were pretty amazing too. We got baklava, it wasn't too sweet, too nutty, or too sticky. A really nice balance between filling and phyllo dough. I don't remember the name of the other dessert, it was farina wrapped cheese with crushed pistachio and rose-something syrup. The cheese was the most mild I've ever had, and the syrup really stood out, flowery, but not too sweet.   And for being a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, the service is good - attentive and nice, no dropping your check with the food or taking your order and then forgetting about you.
4	Nqz2oo0iTrBp5qwHbWzw	If you're looking for traditional southern Chinese food, go no further. Make sure that you get the "Chinese menu" it has Chinese, English & Vietnamese and is printed on pink paper. If you get the other one, ask for the pink one, unless you want lemon chicken and Mongolian beef. All the dishes are very reasonable and authentic. Great comfort food, and great prices. If you go with a group, go ahead and grab one of the set menus - a good selection at a great price. My favorites: Chinese Crispy Roasted Pork, Bittermellon w/ Beef, Subgum anything, especially the chow fun, Roasted Duck, and a nice selection of fresh sea foods. you can't get anything fresher than after ordering, the chef goes and "catches' your meal out of the several tanks housing, lobsters, crabs, prawns, tilapia. This is not for the faint at heart, service is near the bottom of their priorities as is the decor and bathroom maintenance, but the food is perfect. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of this place - go on a Sunday night around 7pm and try to get a table. It's packed with families having their weekly get together.
4	zrPoyDeovpkvzuQson86xQ	300 East is located in a quaint Dilworth house. There is something fun and secretive about sitting in a booth tucked away in the second story of the house.   The first time I ate here I had the gorgonzola-stuffed filet mignon, which was wrapped in bacon. Wow. It was delicious. The only problem is that no other entree there could ever compare. Still, the black bean and jerked chicken tortilla is really good (and half the price of the filet mignon).  I'd suggest trying 300 East for lunch. It's a cheaper way to check out the restaurant. I recommend the pimento cheese filet burger or crabcake salad.
4	M88fpmcDI69N26gGU97nQ	First of all, anyone who bashes in this place is obviously an over zealous "high and mighty" Yelper. Being in the military, and being stationed at Nellis for 3 months, this place is practically off base and is great for some comfort food.  This place isn't gourmet, ritzy, or trying to impress you in any way. All it is, is down home really sweet servers and good food to come with it. The place is covered with squadron patches which is really cool.  I've been here 3 times and had "The King" pulled pork sandwich every time! It's so yummy when you're craving a sammich. I keep the coleslaw on it and slather the sticky red sauce in it for maximum sauciness. Wait staff is always so nice and helpful. I'm leaving Nellis today cuz i'm done with my TDY, but i surely will be back!
2	093AKWzCjGhWpwMGpRdKxA	This Subway is closest to me, but I'd rather travel to another. While there are a handful of friendly employees here, the majority of them are not. They usually don't clean the knife in between sandwiches so my sandwich will be covered in whatever the person in front of me ordered. This location seems to constantly run out of bread and be left with only one type even in the afternoons. I've gone several times where the employees have closed 15-20 mins early and make me feel like a bother for trying to get a sandwich when they are still open. The last time I went there was no air conditioning on in the store even though it is really hot out, so my cold sub felt like it was toasted by the time I got it. The meat was disgusting and hot and when I contacted the manager asking for a refund, I was ignored.
4	ucBXtbJU7pqLAVVFW9ufmg	We ate here tonight for the first time, pretty good food. We got the all you can eat sushi which is actually worth it. You just tell them what you want and they'll bring it out to you. The hot and sour soup was really good. The crunch roll was yummy. We had two servings of it. Tea was a little too strong though. The staff was friendly. Place was clean. I would eat here again..
4	fZtGjKzY1BG3VSU8wC7UCw	Thai Noodle Bowl is awesome!  I didn't expect it, but it had so many yummy veggies perfectly cooked in a fabulous creamy peanut sauce.  My new favorite dish.  The atmosphere is quite cozy, too.  Nice place.
4	rM8ORkyYum9umuWFCrc1aQ	I keep going back to Tokyo Stop, as do all my friends, so I'm giving it an extra star. Plus, it's always packed!   The teriyaki chicken is my new favorite. It's large enough to share with a friend for lunch, as long as you get the lunch combo... : )
4	Dpvtp7WDqEpQZJjPPPLpg	One of my favorite sandwich chains by far! When it comes to the big sandwich chains in town (Subway, Quizno's, Firehouse, etc), this one is by far my favorite. The french bread and the sliced wheat are both SO YUMMY, but they also make low carb unwiches as well. The beach club with sprouts, avocado, cucumber, and turkey, and the Italian Sub (called Vito) are my 2 favorites depending on my moods. The prices are reasonable ( under $5 for most sandwiches), and the service is "freaky fast" as they say... I will say this location is tiny inside, and I wouldn't head over there and plan on dining in with a group larger than 2 ! Otherwise it's the same yummy sandwiches found at every other JJ.
2	3qYdRRO0NtjokwiUq6q4w	Had a chicken sandwich with 'supposedly' large fries last week. Bland sandwich tasteless, fries were said to be large but they were so less that I cud count them on my fingers! I don't think I wil ever visit them again.
2	vlFfQfyOwhCnU8NHvgeSQ	At 12:15 on a Tuesday afternoon my daughter and I walked in and ordered two chicken dishes, a buffalo chicken sandwich and a chicken, goat cheese, and almond salad.  They had run out of chicken and only had enough for one of our entrees, so my daughter ordered her sandwich and I was going to order a different salad.    I decided on the "apple, cranberry, blue cheese" salad.  I asked the workers (two behind the counter), what exactly was on the salad--anything else?  They told me no, just apples, cranberries and blue cheese, and had a little giggle at my expense.  We laughed, too.  So the salad came to the table, and on it was cucumbers, tomatoes and walnuts.  No blue cheese, no apples.  My daughter and I chuckled at this ridiculousness!  I asked for the blue cheese, and decided to forgo the apples.  It was tasty at least!  My daughter's chicken was well-cooked and the side order of grilled veggies was great!  But truly, the lovely setting out back on the deck is what made our lunch.
4	6Cac9nBEnBg8arW2Sd42g	We stopped in one night during the week and there were only 2 other tables with people.  Didn't change much during the rest of the meal so maybe they make it up on weekends.  Anyway, the service was quite adequate for us as the waitress gave us some time to decide on our meal and then quickly took the order.  The bread and olive oil that was served first was very good.  Our order of calamari was excellent!  I usually judge an Italian restaurant on how well they do calamari as its a touchy dish to get right.  Give them a 5 on that.  Plus it was not skimpy on the amount.  My wife got a steak and I got the lobster ravioli.  The steak was good but nothing to brag about.  My ravioli on the other hand was outstanding!  Nice chunks of lobster, a perfect cream sauce and 4 big pillows of wonderful hand made pasta!    Didn't have desert but they have some nice dishes.  Overall, I'd come back to try some of their other stuff.
2	ZdjMK9sEy5eEHOFD55XKow	I like Boston Pizza, but this one let us down. Bland and overcooked, and  a long wait on a slow day does not make me happy. You guys need to get it together, and find the standards that we expect you to uphold.
2	1vMRvQHLQ8SXPyFg1KLYQ	The only reason it didn't get a 1 star is because I enjoyed the waiters and the drinks here are pretty good. Other than that nothing special. I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer only to get 6 huge rings with tons of batter and oil. The batter wasn't that great either as it was coated with some spices and a good amount of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG).  I then ordered the Philly Cheese Burger. It's sort of a mix between a Philly Cheese Steak and a Hamburger. The burger itself wasn't bad. The let down in the burger was it was pretty expensive for a burger (which wasn't even that big.) I think I should have just stuck with the wings, but that's it. I don't think I will come here to eat again, but to drink with friends I will be back (even though the prices are a little expensive for day to day hang out.)
4	WVibVIQkQokKcxbVYd89w	Found this place from one of the menus they left on my apartment door. I'm usually skeptical of places that do that but I was feeling sick and really wanted some wonton soup so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. I got there and decided to order a small chicken chow mein as well. It also came with white rice which was nice since many places charge extra for rice. The chow mein was awesome, not overly greasy or salty, and the chicken in it was really good quality. The biggest problem I have with many Chinese restaurants is poor-quality fatty chicken (and other meats) but this was delicious white meat. The wonton soup was also great, not too salty like some places, and the wontons were delicious as was the pork inside of them. Overall, if I'm looking for some relatively inexpensive Chinese food, I would definitely go back.
4	zlgJONeppcvT3QTqoObJ0A	I have not been to this place in over 5 years until last night . It's a place that I think is easy to forget is there . You really need to know the area to find it . Known for it's huge beer selection . No dissapointment . 5 stars .The food is typical bar food with a few better enterees. 3 stars . The service  we had on the deck was top notch . The bar inside seems small but cozy . Great place to take a date and sit on deck and chat .
4	g2rMm4aPL1nrB1czVGsZQ	The place was clean The service was nice The food was ... well it is Taco Bell.   We had a few things for a quick lunch. I tried the beef enchirito and a beef griller. I loved the griller thing. Kid #1 had a combo burrito and #2 had a nachos with meat and cheese only.   While the meal was fine the price was just right! That is why they are still around. CHEAP and QUICK.
2	2Nj8K4H5zboaxytrEMZodQ	Its a huge burger, that doesn't taste like anything. at all. the bread is dry, the meat is dry. It's just to fill you up for the hell of filling your tummy with something that tastes like nothing. French fries are not crispy at all..Staff are nice, all smiling and stuff but the food is-I don't know what else to add. Absolutely disappointed.
2	BzKHJrRXNPSUEpcTWFR7w	Rumi is pan-middle eastern restaurant.  I am from Iranian origin, and I couldn't tell what was Iranian on the menu (other than the poet Rumi).  The appetizers are good, the main food is only okay.  If you want real persian food, I wouldn't go here.  If you do want to go here, I'd suggest going heavy on the appetizers with bread, and sharing the chicken dweshy dish.  The salmon was dry, but the mushroom sauce is good, and the lamb dish is reminiscent of a moroccan tagine but not quite the same.
2	Pf0muUpXtsYymnQv8ckoZA	Someone please, please tell me why these places are so popular.  I really don't get it.  The food is very, very average.  The place has no edge and nothing sets it apart.  Why would anyone go to these places?  Why not find a good deli or local coffee shop?   To be fair, they have good iced tea but that doesn't exactly require a master chef.  I hate how poeple frequent mediocre establishments in this town just because they are everywhere.  Support local, everyone...please...
2	J9aGn2J6lVobu8vPNOQ7yA	Not sure if these are Amano's employees writing these reviews, but this pie is decidedly average at best. I ordered the stuffed sausage pizza. The sauce is very plain - like plain tomato sauce (as is the "marinara" for the garlic bread). The crust is really good and the cheese is not bad, but overall it is nothing special. Save your money and get a Papa Dell's. I hate the wait at Dell's and the crust was a bit overcooked last time I was there but it's still the best pie in town.
4	g2c8dlnRDffxv5LAuHbTw	As someone who was brought up on Turkish food, I was pretty impressed.  I had the Izmir kofte with lentil soup, both of which were great and authentic, but their yellow rice was unfamiliar to me.  My friend had the salmon special, which was also in an unfamiliar style, though he was apparently very pleased with it.  Lunch came out to about $20 for the two of us.  The service suffered a bit toward the end, particularly because they only had 2 wait staff for lunch, and they were clearly overworked.
4	kSMP07WctGzuGP3FpCXQ	Like Prissy, I *heart* Orange Table's Monkey Cakes and agree that the portions are extremely generous.  The service is extremely unpredictable: I've been in and out within 45 minutes for a weekend breakfast but have also waited for an hour for my food.  The puzzling thing is that the wait doesn't always seem to correlate with the number of patrons in the restaurant.  All in all, I like OT for when I want to hit Fashion Square after breakfast and am too lazy to schlep downtown to Matt's Big Breakfast.  A bonus: if the wait is driving you crazy, you can always cruise next door to browse the displays at the creepy wig shop.
2	AyYoQzkgmg9n58YsF8vQ	This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard. The naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.
2	sAHIDsCYUbO0jbIuKkOyZQ	Stopped in today for lunch after learning Taqueria Los Parados has closed. We tried the Italian sub with pasta salad and the eggplant parm with garlic knots.  Eh! I make a better sandwich at home. Plus, the bread was soggy from too much oil and vinegar. The eggplant was tough and the sauce was very acidic. Pretty disappointing. I'll stick with Siena Deli on West Sahara for my Italian deli fix.
2	QfMEBU2h1FyRySJTlcT0w	Sorry Emily R.  I tried this place out because you told me it was your favorite but it looks like different strokes for different folks.  With that being said, I will still recommend you try it if you are a sushi fan like me and my boyfriend.  We absolutely love sushi!  Here we tried the Orleans Roll, Hamachi Special, Stacie Roll, Spider Roll, and a few nigiri such as Hamachi, and Salmon.  I was not impressed at all with the any of the rolls except the Stacie Roll which was the best one of them all.  The nigiri was disappointing because the rice to sushi ratio was ridiculous!  It ruins the whole AYCE process with the amount of rice they put in their nigiri.  They have a pretty good variety of side dishes but was not too impressed with their edamame; it was too salty.  The shrimp tempura came out just right, and I was happy to have a bowl of udon as a side dish.    They do have the best green mussels in town.  Yelpers did not disappoint on this one; I totally agree!  I still say try it.  I went twice with a friend, and another time with my boyfriend.  We all agreed, we won't be coming back.
4	cVniVfx3g73nC3RoFOLow	Gave me a free drink. Too many people calling, so i had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  Thank you for free drink. I had to clock back in at 1:45pm late clock in. A free drink won't do it. They need 4 people. Never leave one employee working alone in a pizza place.
2	MaXaXKWHgZPwpOdY0RKdQ	I tried this place for the second time yday, but I'm still having trouble getting excited about it.   Things we tried:  Chicken wings (mild): Nothing special. I honestly prefer PT"s wings.  Coconut shrimp with maui fries: coconut shrimp were alright, but the fries sucked. They were limp and greasy and tasteless.   Pizza/salad combo: Caesar salad had a weird taste to it. Maybe some would like it, I didn't. The pizza was very *eh*. If I'm doing the "mini" pizza thing in the future I will always do BJ's instead. $5 during happy hour and far tastier!!  Oh and screw them for ending happy hour at 6 PM. $4 for a freaking Coors Light at 6:15 is depressing. It's not like we're on the strip!
2	DdWJXjzxfFCuulTTGCmSNQ	Another new business for Goodyear. It has been open a few weeks I believe.  This is a less elaborately set restaurant than others in the chain. This is not to say there is anything wrong with the building or its d\u00e9cor, just nothing special. At the moment it is the only business on the south east corner of Bullard and McDowell.   We had made a reservation for 7:30 PM. Saturday. When w e arrived there were several parties waiting, in fact it was overflow in the waiting area. Telling the hostess that we had an reservation we were seated right away, which often does not happen.   The young lady serving us was right on for drinks of which were served quickly. She had a very pleasant smile and demeanor.   We ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps along with Salt & Pepper Calamari for our starters.  The wraps were tasty and the Calamari was excessively salty.  Soup was also ordered it was the Hot and Sour. This had no spark. The flavour was flat and much too much corn flower for thickening.   Four different entrees were ordered, Cantonese Chow Fun, Sichuan Shrimp, Lemon Chicken and Crispy Honey Chicken. The Chow Fun was listless and lacking any discernable flavour, this too could be said about the Shrimp while the Lemon Chicken was pretty rout, nothing special and the crispy chicken was not crispy. The only dish with a proper serving was the Chow Fun, but since none was really great it did not matter. None of the mains were hot, all served at very close to room temperature.   Although the service was pleasant it was quite slow after the drinks were brought which might account for the temperature of the food.   Right now writing about it and thinking that what we got was sub par and too much money for product I doubt we will be going back.   Beijing just up the road is much better.
2	DUaVNuuYlQ1tOnu7RVWETQ	Very slow even for them. Hour an a half is a long time on a wednesday night... Delivery guy acted all stressed and in a hurry and he still brought me a cold pizza. Stjll tastes better then dominos and pizza hut but I still expect better from papa johns. Definetly gonna pick up my pizza for now on
2	JaPmPmyRQeidn9jRcz1Cw	While I typically like Burger King's burgers, the customer service at this location is a nightmare. I rarely frequent this location just because of their awful attitudes. I don't need to pay people to treat me like I'm bothering them to do their jobs.
4	xc92LUDgxvY4l4F6gk4ttQ	One of the original grimy and dirty psuedo-mex sort of places - and I mean "grimy and dirty" in the best way possible. It's not texmex, but not really real mexican food. Neither the menu choice nor the food itself are particularly good, but if you're looking for a good, say, bean and cheese burrito, this is a solid choice. And they serve Pepsi products, always a bonus for those of who like Dew. If you're looking for something a bit nicer, Guedo's is a block south and is significantly nicer to sit down and eat at. They also have much better food and a bar - but are almost double the price. I may have a positive bias for this place, considering the many times I ate there during my HS days, but any mexican food fan in Chandler needs to eat here at least once.
4	Vhe3qqVScKrdc80PkdSvgg	Wicked place! Not quite sure with what the string of poor reviews is about, but maybe they've improved things since? The food and drink were excellent. I'm not gonna get into detail about why it was great, it just was. My ol' lady n' me... we know when we like something. Anyhow, the only thing lacking in this experience was the service. If I'm spending money like one should at Magnus, I expect service to be with it and involved. I'm not sure if our server was on a different planet last night, or if she maybe isn't happy about high check averages and good tips. I'm not looking for handjobs under the table, nor am I asking for a topless dance on my table, but for frick sake, let's actually act like we want to be there. I've had better service at Monty's Blue Plate... all it takes is a smile, and perhaps the idea that you care about our experience.  We'll be back, we definitely will, but I hope service steps up their game.
2	lBc7mEh89QrcAAipmunJ1w	So NOT the buffet that I want when I got to Vegas (TAXI!!! quick! take me to the buffet at the RIo!)  After waiting for what seemed like forever in line that morning for brunch, we finally got seated.  Then we went thru the buffet - it was so so.  There was nothing spectacular about the food, nothing interesting, or unusual that would make it stand out - nothing that would make me ever want to come back.    Vegas is about trying new foods, and experiencing things, this was not something that I would consider new - or an experience.  it was just blah.
2	tURnuitvJek0avPLczpAPA	Gave Cafe Rio a try after a friend recommended it. Tried the steak burrito enchilada style and two tacos: chicken and pork barbacoa, and ordered chips and salsa.   The steak burrito was quite good. The tacos, however, weren't. The pork was way too sweet for my liking and the chicken was far too bland. The chips were ok, one of the salsa was heavily flavored with lime, to the point it was inedible. The other was decent.  Photos are posted.
4	zHt3Qd69u1evl8giNLCfw	Tried  Chinese   food  several miles around 83rd and Thunderbird  wasn't  satisfied  .looked on Yelp and seen reviews work New Chen Wok .ordered Imperial  Seafood Gourmeti specialties  .the best I've  had  in a long time
4	xuwhXhfSF3FhJm6kfhH2JA	Update: 24 March 2008  Robert McGrath sold his interest in the Roaring Fork. He now owns Pischke's Blue Ribbon on 1st St. in Old Town Scottsdale. He's done a heck of a job with it. Very nice. His new restaurant, REM, will be located in the former Anderson's Other Place on Lincoln, just west of Scottsdale Rd. Although the target opening date is this April, it appears unlikely at this point. Who knows. Robert is also working on a joint venture for a barbecue place. I don't know how much, if any, of the information regarding that venture is public knowledge, so I'll add an update and review when I know it's OK to talk about it.  Re the Roaring Fork. I have not been there in many months now, so I can't vouch for my earlier review's accuracy today. I do know that a number of staff members have followed him to Pischke's.  Original Review:  I've eaten only occasionally in the main dining room, but do manage to make it to the bar on a more or less weekly basis. Their Happy Hour menu offers a number of excellent items at really reasonable prices. For example, the Fish Tacos and the Half a Rotisserie Chicken are both around $7.50. The Fish Tacos are crisp and relatively light. The Half a Rotisserie Chicken, served with a warm flour tortilla and extras from which you can fashion a chicken fajita burro on your own, is a complete meal all by itself.  But be warned. During the season, getting a seat at the bar or at one of the tables in the bar area (the saloon) is difficult. Regulars and people in the know get there right at 4:00pm for the "bell" announcing the opening of the bar. Happy Hour ends at 7:00pm, but the entire bar menu remains available, excepting that each item costs $1 more (still a bargain).  The owner, Robert McGrath, is opening a second location (to be called REM) in the building complex under construction just to the south (and just north of Fashion Square) that will have a more traditional interior and menu. I suspect that it will also have a dose of his sense of humor (reading the bar menu at RF is a gas).
4	seZSra9fIuoPVbROLNnKwA	GAMES..... lots of GAMES.... we played Scrabble.  I won!  Wow!  The Hefeweizen was the BEST I'd ever had... like an orange creamsickle... yum!  The waitress went all agro on some of my friends who had table service and apparently someone forgot to pay or pay tip.  It was an accident and we were trying to fix it and she was getting like, psycho but acting like she didn't care and it was no big deal.  For that I have to remove a star.  But I'd go back!
4	aa0kTVaIoriLIlhfJVHOg	Grazie, grazie!!  A hidden gem - and I describe it as hidden because it's tucked away just a bit down a side street off Providence in Myers Park. A friend selected this spot for Saturday night girlie chat and I'm glad she did.  Cutting to the chase - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.    The Good (great, actually): The d\u00e9cor of Primo is lovely. Cozy, comfortable, white linen, elegantly dressed tables, little tucked away areas in addition to the more open main dining room.  Excellent service from start to finish - attentive but never overbearing - and great recommendations from our server.    With so many inviting appetizers from which to select, we were reluctantly forced to settle for just a couple.  Selections included Shrimp St. Thomas and Scallops wrapped in Smoked Salmon.  Both were delicious.  Of note, the mustard honey cream sauce served with the shrimp, and the surprising (to me anyway) tasty paring of smoked salmon atop the scallops.  Yes, I'll be trying this at home and hoping for a result that is even mildly close.  Entrees included Veal Osso Bucco (tender, oh so tender!) served with rosemary risotto and Rack of Lamb. Osso Bucco is always a treat and not every restaurant prepares it well.  But Primo exceeded all expectation.  Tender, flavorful and braised to perfection.  For the first time, I dared try the marrow (as our server recommended we do so) and found the flavor interesting and quite different.  The lamb was perfect.  Clearly we left no room for dessert but were crazy enough to at least hear the selections and berate ourselves for overindulging and thus left unable to partake.  There's always next time!.  I should mention there is a great wine list and the pour is generous to say the least.  The Bad and the Ugly: That was just a tease, there is no bad or ugly here.  Primo is wonderful and we will return soon.  Grazie indeed!
2	BTQ2k2KAqZ7MKGIZa9gd9A	This review pertains to the lunch menu only.  The Skinny: a watery katsu-don and katsu curry makes a lunch a no-go (2.5) service: friendly, efficient (3), value: the cost of a katsu-don combination and katsu curry was around $16 not including tax and tip.  Let me start off by saying that this place really is a Yakiniku place so that's why I must clarify that I didn't try any of their Yakiniku offerings - just their lunch specials.  My hubby and I tried their katsu-don combination (which comes with soup, salad, and pickles; $7.50) and their katsu curry (which comes with soup; $8)   I really enjoyed their miso soup and salad. The salad dressing had some lovely overtones of yuzu with wonderful fresh ingredients. The miso soup was flavourful, well seasoned, and had a good amount of soft tofu.  Unfortunately the entrees did not receive the same sort of loving. My katsu-don suffered from poor textures (ie, lack of crispiness of the katsu when combined with the egg) . Albeit the quality of the pork chop was very good, it was hard to overlook the pool of au jus that the rice was swimming in. Honestly, I would not order this again.  The katsu curry plate suffered from the watery consistency of the curry. The flavours of the curry decidedly one note, overpoweringly edged towards too much ginger. The tonkatsu was good but not the best we've ever had.  Overall, I would likely not return for lunch however I would consider returning for the yakiniku that they are known for.
4	EAeGf1W6yJXkQU7ThhhjVw	I will be the first to admit that by choice Subway is new to me. But now it is on my regular lunch menu. How can it not be since they started toasting the bread and have the $5 foot longs! Hard to say no to a $5 foot long, wouldn't you agree.  This Subway location is very convenient to my work place and is usually pretty busy, but I have never had to wait too long for my sub and the employees are nice and talkative.  When I first went to Subway I wasn't impressed with their tiny meat slices and lack of cheese, but I have started ordering the chicken breasts and getting the cheese toasted and I now I feel that I am getting my money's worth. Not to mention their new flavored breads, really delish!
4	RJRDLZ9fxig6W89jKaELQ	Overall one of the best Chinese take out dinners I've had in Madison. It is more expensive than most other Americanized Chinese restaurants but most of the food we've had from here is worth it. The appetizers were the low point of the meal. $2 for one small egg roll isn't worth it. And the crab rangoons were hard but chewy at the same time and very little filling. The orange beef was fantastic! The hot level of spice wasn't quite as spicy as I was expecting but definitely had a kick to it. The quality of the meat was far above any other that I've had and the broccoli was not over cooked to mush. The Moo shu chicken actually came with authentic pancakes not the tortillas that most places serve. Will definitely order again.
2	dVhAA6KJQLEnNwfmF4W6rw	Service was fine, ambiance is nice and the lunch special pricing is good.  So why the 2?  Well.. I really like spicy food, but spice with FLAVOR.... not the kind of spice that just rips your tongue off and leaves you with no taste buds whatsoever.  And unfortunately when I ordered the Panang Curry at what I thought was a pretty conservative spice level of 2 out of 4 (yes, they only give you a 1-4 range... lame), they gave me the kind of spice I HATE.   I couldn't even enjoy it.  About halfway through I had lost any sense of taste and I had tears coming out of my eyes.  For a level 2?!  And the strange thing is, my brother ordered his dish (I believe it was the Pad See Ew) at a spice level 2 and his wasn't nearly as hot as mine.  So that leads me to believe they don't really know what they're doing in the kitchen, and by reading some of the other reviews I don't think this was an isolated incident.  So that was a bummer.  Maybe if I gave them a second chance I'd have a better experience, but I don't see myself rushing back any time soon.
2	Gbn0b9LBv16zHp33iXc1Mw	I hate to be mean, but my pizza was over cooked and there was nothing on it, then my husbands meatball sandwich was the size of a kids meal. We were in shock at how small it was.. :(... I heard the salads are great tho-guess I should've had that...
2	1KJvQ4UDRJg451UjyL6Efw	Clean.  Nice workers.  But let's face it...quality Chinese food, this ain't.  The vegetables had a weird film of...something.  Everything else tasted very sugary and overly salty all at once.  But in a pinch, it'll fill your belly and not break your wallet.
2	xvIGESYLqkwHhxoGtOjkJw	Great ambience and welcoming staff. Good wine menu and a nice fusion styled menu. Sapporo on tap, which is always a bonus. We had the steak and salt crusted baked potato. The sour creme was ice cold and the steak was so covered in heavily salted sauce that none of the meat flavors came through. The salt crusted potato was covered and I mean covered in salt. I did complain to the waiter, who of course, predictably said "well it's salt crusted." It was salt soaked & caked inedible buddy! They gave us a portion of fries as a replacement but brought out enough fries for the whole restaurant.   I would give them a second chance but to be honest, it's more worth trying something else.
4	kq0YmR5ECJkcvpWvu97DxQ	Pretty darn yummy. I must say for being a small place the food was good good.  Everything tastes delicious. I would definitely come back when ever I'm in AZ.  Enchilada was on point and the shredded beef crispy taco was bomb.  I'm so full so come on an empty stomach.  Enjoy
2	MstnMKhp3aCRCQDCa9KkaQ	Food was above average (cream of corn was excellent) but the service at the bar was pretty subpar.  Definitely not the same level of service as is given at the tables. 25+ minutes for a ceasar salad, and the place wasn't even busy.  So, I'd recommend this place, but don't sit at the bar.
4	3Ponl8CnqVtNv5a0ssH5g	I really like this chic-fil-a for breakfast before heading to Concord Mills.   Food is straight, service is always great as well. What's not to like.   The only time can ever encounter issues here is on Saturdays when it gets packed out. And never forget, they are always closed on Sunday.
2	tI0F9fFwAe0t8SMLSPvdQ	Boston Pizza is probably a place that is meant for a group a guys to watch a game and drink a lot because the food quality is not really up to par.  I ordered a fettuccine alfredo pasta dish with chicken and mushrooms and the chicken was tasteless and the alfredo sauce was bland.  This chain really needs to upgrade their food quality as I would not be going back to eat until it does.  The ambience is family friendly on one side and bar friendly on the other side, which is a great mix, now if they could only fix the quality of food problem, this place would thrive.
2	3zQ7Gsw6eOCm3epZjXIkg	Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location.
2	GRXSM3u1fH8SMpNWtyFuA	Food itself is still great, but these new owners don't understand the importance of Cholula. We came here a few weeks ago and they were out of Cholula and only had Tobasco (yuck), now they are out of both. C'mon, get it together!  The Tempe location always has plenty.
4	qXzOa3pkvM9QHTbDbefbQ	Salim's is the consummate place to pick up quick and satisfying snacks. I love his babaganoush and vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. And his hummus is some of the best around. Not my favorite spinach pies in town, but you can't win 'em all. You can also count on Salim's for basic Mediterranean grocery items. We just picked up some pomegranate syrup (real grenadine) to experiment with.
2	gCC1zJhZh6ePDbL2eY2pA	So for the first thing wrong with this place, the food is expensive and they do not offer meal deals so if you want to get a gyro with fries and drink it will be over 10 bucks.  Now on to the food:  pretty awful.  The gyro meat was dry and really had no taste and the tzatziki sauce pretty much tasted like yogurt.  It, as well, had no taste.  The spanikopita was bland. If you want good gyros go to Yannis Greek Grill
4	gCVaMJB5iSjKIG65InwUaw	Great atmosphere. Perfect sushi restaurant for after work drinks and a quick bite. The location on South Boulevard is nice and yet parking is still OK. The sushi is not cheap, but the quality and art of sushi is what you expect from a high end sushi restaurant. I am not an elitist so I prefer the cool atmosphere with the quality in the food. If it were more stuffy or "quite" I would not like Nikko as much.  Almost my fav spot in Charlotte, but definitely up there...
4	9osza80lzc6w7hZRUUoQ	Stop by here every so often for a quick bite to eat. Food is always decent, fair prices, and pretty good service. The only issue I really have is that they can be pretty slow with the orders sometimes. Staff is usually friendly and apologize about the wait, but it happens way to often for my liking.
2	jfVSmbbOIjo3jzlfj5iAdg	Went on a Friday.  The price board at the register said $14.99 dinner, but they rang us up at $16.99.  Excuse me?  I pointed this out to the cashier and she explained that it is a seafood feast on Fridays, so the price is higher.  Okay, but couldn't you maybe get special $8 signs made up for your cash registers explaining this?  I mean, it's a minor expense, compared to the millions of dollars you dupe your "customers" out of at the machines every month!  Alrighty... you want to charge me more than you're telling me you charge, yet you offer me unlimited crab legs?  You fools!  Now I get even.  Seriously, AYCE snow crab legs.  Of course, they're on ice when you get them, and if you want to get them warmed up you have to go all the way to the other end of the buffet to the Asian area where they have a steam box.  The set up of the place has changed in the past 8 years since I first ate there, and it is most definitely NOT for the better.  Dessert selections, while tasty, are nowhere near as plentiful or accessible as they used to be.  Now you have to wait in line while someone behind the counter reaches into a display case to get your portion-controlled desserts.  Previously, they were all out in easily accessed choose-your-own-size glorious presentation.  Service here was marginal at best.  The foods other than the crab legs were mediocre.  This place has seriously gone to hell in the past few years.
2	wT0ZdZroKCVLA08A2ufQ	This was my first and last time here. Although the service was really friendly, the food was really bad. The hot and sour soup was almost tasteless and the texture was gummy. There was a good variety of dishes but everything looked as if it had been sitting for a long time. Most of the sauces had a film floating on top. The sushi looked horrific. You're better off going to one  of the all you can eat sushi places that also have Chinese food.
2	liQYd6GbADx380MQeUbv6A	First, a positive note. They have significantly reduced the drive thru time, which used to be incredibly long. The food itself is fine in taste, but they need to appreciate the importance of attractive food presentation. I go there because of the boxed meal. It packs a good portion of food in a small, reasonably priced area. I love a box! The Taco Bell Big Box Meal, the Taco Bell Volcano Box Meal...it doesn't have to just be Taco Bell - Long John Silvers Snack Box, the KFC Guitar Hero Box... chances are, if its a box, I am going to eat it. So imagine my disappointment when the box meal comes in a bag. The server indicated they were out of boxes. This isn't the first time I have ordered from this location and went home box-less. It should be a simple analysis of sales, projection of sustainable demand and the appropriate number of boxes ordered. How difficult is that? Even worse, I get home with my Volcano Bag Meal and the volcano taco is busted in three places. It is more or less a volcano taco salad. The second taco was a regular taco and it was broken along the bottom - so one bite and the contents were on the paper. What are they doing back there with the tacos?  The cinnamon twists were fine and so was the volcano burrito - then again its more difficult to break a burrito...So Taco Bell, let's get the presentation down. If you are going to advertise a box, give me a box.
4	UyoHuJofTsugfiZuT2J3w	NYPD is the old standby.  Always consistent always good.  I recently had the Italian beef salad.  It was different, but good.  The wings, salads, meatballs and most importantly pizza are all good as well.  The service is always good.  We have been going to NYPD since they opened their first restaurant on Via Linda ( it is now something else) .  You will never go wrong at NYPD.
4	tzNygqu7vkdh17bbJe93ZQ	Yep, I'm yelping Ming's Pagoda.   A favorite for my circle of friends for years, Ming's never disappoints. Food so fast, you'd expect a shy on quality, but it never happens! The staff is always polite and attentive and the food is sooooo goooddd.  The value is huge too! The prices are very reasonable. I don't want to use the word cheap since there isn't anything lacking in service or taste.   Always helps to have someone who can order off of the "special" menu, too.  AWESOME for groups~
2	hfEKJWfSTH2lwjPWmOimeQ	So apparently JK Rowling often wrote Harry Potter here. I think you need to be a true Potter head to give a hoot about that. I don't understand the big deal. Do Harry Potter fans hope by coming here they will bump into JK? Or Harry Potter will be working there? It all seems very odd to me.   Because of this "connection" with Harry Potter, Elephant House does a roaring trade. Goodness knows why because it's a standard cafe selling mediocre cakes and coffee. There are a hundred better (quieter) cafes in Edinburgh, so unless you are a die hard Harry Potter fan there is not reason to go here. In fact even if you are a die hard Harry Potter fan there is no reason to go here, unless you are expecting a wizard to appear and bestow upon you great wealth similar to that of JK.
4	RWTDE9l5HtxHLHl7oGvQQ	Looking for a place to hang with friends? This is the place.  Looking to grab a beer and watch the scenery alone? This is the place.  Looking to grab something to eat? This is the place.  No matter what time my friends and I stop by, the bartenders are friendly and the food is good.  We have eaten everything from the appetizers, to the delicious cheese tortellini (that could rival many of the high priced strip restaurants).
2	Twib6RuJGJdT3VYATKYSg	I lived in Japan for about 2 years so anytime I feel reminiscent of those drunken 4am nights I come here.  Not really so much like the ones in Japan though.  And I didn't think Yoshinoya was one of the better gyu-don places in Japan anyways.    They should add Japanese curry to their menu.  I also wish they offered white meat chicken too.  I also agree with the weirdness of the veggie color.  I don't know why its gotta be so damn yellow.  Just go to Ichiza instead.
4	jLGbdjooyBpw0HfejzOFQ	I came for the burger-  After viewing a few years old episode of George Motz's "Burger Land", a co-worker and I stopped in for lunch one day.  Really, just a small bar with a flat top behind the bar.  Nothing any more special than you would find in countless Wisconsin small towns.  Something must have brought George here...  Enter the "Brick Burger"  Soft bun, smallish patty (Hand formed?  Not sure) and covered in a huge slab of Wisconsin Brick Cheese.  The burger itself seemed pretty standard.  Some salt, some pepper, and a hot grill.  3 stars for the burger-  4 stars for the messy, cheesy glob of Wisconsin Brick Cheese melted on top- Yummo!
2	6fUBUnPVThhxH0iKSZHVPQ	We went  around 2ish in the afternoon place was dead, and the service was so bad.....  he was inordinately slow and never checked back I had to get up and go find him to get our check. I know the food is standard corporate hard to mess up but it was bad. Sloppily prepared, missing the fries just no attention. Management needs to step up their game.
2	6bGOH5q5JCbc3sY1vXA2mA	All I can say is yuck.  Great and all for having wheat pitas and lamb specials, but the menu isn't interesting and the food isn't either.  It is also cool that they have Republic of Tea bottles, but they are probably too expensive.  I never had a good meal here, and service is blah.  The sirloin sandwich with eggplant spread was okay, beef was chewy.  The mezza salad was just canned veggies thrown together.  My fries were cold though we waited awhile and were the only people in there at 4:30 PM, and my divided plate - one side dish was a huge blob of ketchup!  yuck.  I don't like condiments, but especially not all over my plate - put it on the side or at the self serve area by the drinks!  Eric decided to switch his order of fries to veggie couscous -the cashier could not ring up the cheaper side with the entree, so she gave it to him for free.  It was mushy veggies with the skins still on?? and couscous...more blah.  Uninspiring all around, not much better than its neighbor panera who is always out of things.  +1 for Shangri-La tropical iced tea.
2	BvZc2ZzAhlJJHHPtCTvIlA	We should have gone to Le Burger Bistro, but by the time we sat down and peeked at the menu, we were too tired to change our minds.    The blue cheese & mushroom burger I had was good (and huge), but the onion rings were kind of icky and the restaurant felt like a throwback to Vegas in the 70's...as if time had stood still.  Plus, we showed up to dinner at around 7pm and it was like eating during the Early Bird Special at Denny's.    There are plenty of better restaurants within walking distance...I recommend you go elsewhere.
2	U5mpBmfqx4dACnttb5Mntw	I'm not going to lie.  I expect a lot out of a restaurant on the strip.  Furthermore, I totally thought this was the ESPN Zone.  I guess that license was removed for some reason.  I doubt I would have bothered coming here if not for the ESPN license.  Also, it was my birthday and my friends told me later that they tried to get something--you know birthday song, a tiny scoop of ice cream, shoot a paid dessert with a candle in it.  The most they would do is put a generic greeting on the sports ticker.  It was unique but the message wasn't even personalized.  The message kept scrolling throughout our meal and halfway through a second birthday greeting to someone else ran right behind my greeting.  Honestly, I feel worse for the poor soul whose greeting had to follow my greeting every time.  My buddy and I shared the Tailgate Party Platter which included a quesadilla, hot wings, buffalo wings, four sliders, artichoke dip and chips and some pork ribletts.  The quesadilla and artichoke dip were disappointing.  The cheese had cooled and wasn't very stringy or tasty.  The sliders were well done and the meat off the ribletts came right off the bone.  The hot wings were good, but nothing special, while I thought the buffalo wings were sub-par.  Bottom line:  I think this place is past it's prime.  I remember trying to get in when it was the ESPN Zone in 2007 and it was packed.  Now it seems like it is just living in the shadow of what it used to be.  I guess it falls in line with the trend that anything south of the Citycenter in Las Vegas is struggling to keep up these days.  Find another place to eat and catch your game.
4	n5E9mZcAVDBumqgwQfp5Q	Best drinks when I'm reminded of how good I had it growing up in the caribbean.  Do NOT go between the hours of 4-9 on a Friday/Saturday night, you won't fit.  But otherwise, my fave place to get fruity yummy drinks!!!
4	q3OWRGLiUH4FTAErCNN6g	This bar is definitely not for trendy folks or people looking to 'be seen'.  It is a nice neighborhood sports bar with good bar food at a great price.  1/29/07 Philly's recently got a facelift and has new tables and they even have booths now.  They have also expanded their menu to include more dinner type meals, instead of just bar favorites.  Wednesday night they have a steak night with drink specials and a reduced price steak dinner.  Of course you can always order one of the many varieties of cheese steak sandwiches, because they are delicious.  This is just a relaxing bar with good food and a friendly staff.
2	kxbBatdMP09d1YHct3po2w	Stopped by with a group after work for a week-ending celebratory happy hour.  We sat in the nearly-empty restaurant area rather than in the rather crowded bar or either crowded patio.  We were advised that the happy hour specials were only honored in the bar area; at least they were upfront.  As our group slowly filtered in we enjoyed drinks and appetizers, but mostly the company.  The starters were followed up by a variety of mains and sushi and finally a few desserts.  The food quality seemed to vary quite a bit from dish to dish.  Some were better than others, but nothing was spectacular.  The service matched; good but not spectacular.    Overall, the experience wasn't memorable; much like my last visit to a Kona Grill (Scottsdale Fashion Square) many, many years ago (which I honestly don't remember).  Appetized the eyes, but not the palate.
4	KZ64LlsrrqpexT5589pg	There's a lot we like about Rula Bula. Hubby adores the Boxty selections, and even gets a little miffed when other Irish places do not serve them. Last time we went, we decided to try items we had not had before, so we opted to share the Fisherman's Platter (with 4 shrimp, 2 pieces of fish, and 1 scallop and chips) and the Irish Mac & Cheese with Rashers (bacon pieces). The Mac was not as stellar as I hoped, but that didn't stop us from finishing the dish. It needed a bit more seasoning, I think. The Platter was good, but the standout for us both was the chips- 1/4 inch slabs of potato cooked to perfection and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The coleslaw was also the way I like it-crispy, and not too sweet. The meal also came with two types of Irish soda bread and a side salad, which made a very nice lunch the next day, as we were completely stuffed from the dishes we shared. Service was attentive, and the prices are fair. We'll be back for the boxty, for sure.
4	egV16xIXZ1Mm97fcNUMng	Was craving a breakfast buffet at 11am and all the others were switched to lunch. Lots of selection for the price and the majority of the food was good. Made to order omelets was an added bonus. Minus for no Belgium waffles.
2	LHLaqYjVM9i4QnhSMb4w	Let me start by saying the only reason I gave 2 stars is because they do have amazing garlic knots, but that's it. That's all they have going.( a little on the "doughy" side though) Our first visit we ate at the restaurant, I had a salad so not much to screw up. My boyfriend had the tortellini, No complaints. So we decided to order in a couple weeks later. We ordered a pizza, it wasn't the best but It was decent. I had asked for 3 sides of ranch that we never got. Lets say I wasn't thrilled but decided to order again from them 2 days ago, big mistake. We ordered a calzone, anitpasto salad and garlic knots. Again, asking for ranch. I ordered through an app called Eat24, so after i submitted the order I called just to verify I would be receiving the ranch this time. The girl who answered was very rude, and told me to call back in 5 minutes because she was too busy. I guess that should have been my first clue.. So I called back 10 minutes later as not to disturb anyone at their job again, and the man rudely informed me " the ranch cost extra you know" I said yes, I am aware, I'd still like them please. I also asked for extra dressing which seemed to annoy him. When the food finally came (50 mins later, and we live across the street) the delivery driver handed it to me in a box and said oh, I need that back.. When we sat down I saw I had gotten my ranch and was happy... Until I opened it. I dont know about you but I have never been to an italian restaurant with bad ranch.. This goes beyond the word bad. It was like a gelatin almost. It tasted worst than anything I have ever had, Maybe like they bought the generic grocery store bottle and poured it into cups, whatever the case it was awful and I wanted to cry at this point. Our calzone did not come with Marinara sauce, again something I have never experienced. The salad dressing was called Italian, but I am not sure what it was. Mainly olive oil. Worst salad Ive ever had. The calzone was small and had little meat in it. ( we normally order from Angelinas and ALWAYS are happy, they stuff their calzones full of meats). However we ate, because we were hungry. I was up all night sick afterwords.. Such a terrible experience from a place I had such high hopes for.

It made me think twice about how fresh the fish can be if there is no turnover. We order the sushi sushi lover for two which seemed like the best deal since it came with miso soup and green tea as well as 28 pieces of sushi. It consisted of two 6 piece rolls (tuna + salmon) as well as 16 other sushi pieces (8 unique pieces, so 2 of each). The toro was great while the salmon in the salmon roll was a little tough for my liking. The fish came out in a nice cool temperature, not too cold and not too warm and the stickiness of the rice complemented it pretty well.  For dessert, I saw that tempura ice cream (they bread a scoop of ice cream and fry it) was on the menu and I'm always a fan of fried ice cream so I gave it a try. It was definitely not worth the $7.50 price tag. I think you can do better elsewhere if you've never had fried ice cream before.  Overall, I'd say this place is pretty expensive and not the best value you can find but considering it is in station square, that's how it is down there. Service was great, considering we were the only patrons in there for a good 20 minutes until thankfully another party of 2 came in so it wouldn't be awkward.   I would give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't, I'll bump it up to 4 and call it self-justifying the quality of the restaurant due to the amount of money we had to fork out in the end for 2 people.
4	BYJnlGxXAOSSNNhCdylDEw	I hadn't had Pizza Hut in years!  My dad just had knee surgery and this Pizza Hut is next to his PT facility.  He suggested my husband and I pick up pizza and wings for the 4 of us.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I was expecting greasy, thick crust pizza.  I'm sure you can order different types of crust but their standard crust is delicious, thin and crispy.  We ordered half sausage, mushroom and onions and half pepperoni and tomatoes.  The pizza was so good!  I know I tasted some really good garlic and their sauce was good too.  We ordered the garlic and parmesan wings....also very delicious.  I'd definitely go back for pizza and wings!
4	0thQGA9Xs9CeKCMh5iIXqA	Good subs made with fresh sliced-to-order meats and cheeses. This location in Stonecrest is the first of theirs I've visited and I was immediately impressed. The service is quick and friendly, the bread is fresh (typical white or wheat sub rolls, or they also do wraps) and their "Mike's Way" preparation with onion, lettuce, tomato, dressing and spices is delicious. The sandwiches come in 3 sizes to fit all appetites. I think they also do a deal on Tuesdays where you can get a regular size sub, chips and a drink for $5. I've yet to take advantage (we typically go on the weekends when we visit Stonecrest to take in a movie), but sounds like a great deal.
2	cZhgWdRE9JKHbbrhfhg	Linguini's was good, but I've had much better italian dining experiences at other places.  I had the chicken linguine.  The chicken was done well, but I found the sauce to be a little thin.  The red velvet cake for dessert was excellent, however.
4	oghnKBbu50r74lmEiGGV8w	We stopped based on other reviews on Yelp.  While it is not fine dining, the food was hot and tasty.  I can't wait to try breakfast.  The staff makes the place.  They are polite, caring people taking great care of their customers.
4	KOIav4bHafEHdcByNVidPA	So I finally had a meal in the funny looking building.  I quite often get coupons for this place and decided to check them out.  Got there right at opening (10:45).  Everything was out and ready.  Everything was neat and fresh.  One of the soups out was not on the online menu and the mushroom soup was missing.  The front end manager noticed my hesitancy in choosing a soup and made a comment and I told him I was looking for the mushroom soup and he said somebody forgot to order the heavy cream called for and the back end manager was out scouring stores looking for enough.  So I tried a pretty good vegetable beef..  Of course I built a big salad and also had a cold noodle salad and some potato salad and some corn bread.  The only thing I really did not care for was the pizza, but then again this isn't a pizza place.  About 1/2 way through my meal the manager brought over a bowl of mushroom soup from the back, still without the cream but quite tasty.  While this place should be a 3, that attention to customer service in a buffet got them a 4th star.  Everybody I came in contact with was pleasant.  Overall I think I prefer the salad bar at Sizzler because it does a better job of the hot area while being about equal on the salad part of it and they are just down the street from my shop.  But I just might make the drive again with another coupon.
2	umrPxeZdcKp8NsV9FsK4g	tip: small place so better make reservations  this place probably gets the 4.5 yelp stars for the wide selection of beer and martini but really gets one star from the food.  short rib on polenta was good but not very surprising or something that you would go back for.  Bruschetta was very plain though it seemed like it was famous for it which is totally not the case.  jambalaya is creole dish but nonetheless shows up in an Italian restaurant which boggles the mind.  it was okay at best because the rice was not very rich in flavor.  crispy duck is really just deep fried duck, not the pressed in a pan crispy version or roasted.  was not marinated or spiced.  the best things there were the drinks and the service which can't be argued.
2	0h11RE8sbNiezJTLJfQOQ	The way I feel about Rubio's is pretty much the way I feel about Panda Express - if you have to eat there as an alternative to the real thing, you'll have an acceptable meal but wish you had gone somewhere spicier/more authentic/less greasy. Their chips and salsa bar isn't bad, and some of their food items (like the new grilled veggie tacos) are decent, but many other items just fall short. Also, anything that has shrimp in it features tiny, bland-tasting shrimp and will cost you extra. If you have to, go ahead, but in this neighborhood (and in the rest of Phoenix), you'll be able to find better Mexican food for lower prices.
4	LBGcR70ewUNHADlOLtK3ZQ	If you're hungry for lunch and you're one of the many people looking for good, fast, CHEAP Mexican food that ISN'T Roberto's or Don Tortaco, THIS is your place.  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews at all.  The service is always great, the food is always delicious -- specifically the street tacos and sopes with al pastor -- and their selection of fresh salsas is vibrantly spicy (the green stuff) and refreshingly bright (the Pico de Gallo).  I hope more people try this place out, it's become a favorite for our nearby office, and it's always full for lunch!  The only negative things I would say is they often run out of popular items (carne asada, al pastor).  And their tables aren't usually very clean for lunch, simply due to how busy they are and you need to snatch a table as soon as it opens up.  The restaurant itself is really small, so grabbing your food to go isn't a bad idea.  I wouldn't try coming here with a large group.
4	NC1AAJtETMmTMtfIaYTIww	Four Stars for the take out duck!  Thanks Bruce, I had this place bookmarked for some time because I figured he knows his ducks  I guess this place is as authentic as could be, complete with a Chinese only menu and help that's hard to communicate with. There are 3 or 4 types of whole ducks to chose at $20 each, $10 for 1/2. These were healthy, meaty ducks, we bought a half to share.       We reheated it in the oven for a few minutes @375 degrees that evening and it was just terrific.  I mixed a little sweet chili with the dark sauce and it complimented it just right, the meat  was plump and neither dry nor greasy, a feat that only Asians seem to be able to accomplish.    I didn't see any veggies, starches  or sides to go with the duck. A bit awkward that you get take out and still have to cook when you get home but if you love duck, well worth it. Supermarkets charge around $16 for a scrawny, bony frozen bird, so $20 for a perfectly cooked, plump one is a bargain - especially since duck is so damn hard to cook right.
4	ntGRBjVJmolhz2mxaudHg	Being disappointed by one of their neighboring pizza places, I went in here not expecting much better, but I was wrong.  This was one of the best slices I've ever had.  I'm so glad this place is right around the corner from me.  (I still wish these places took credit cards, though.)
2	iJoK3Gv3yiv7BC7Oqc2Yw	The jury is still out on this place. Was curious about this place so me and the wifey checked it out. A little pricey I thought, but luckily I checked in through yelp and got the free garlic knots with a 20 dollar purchase! Pizza was decent but the garlic knots were bomb! Heard about their 40 cent wing tuesdays so that will my next adventure. Until then 2 stars will do. I will consider my rating once the second visit is complete.
4	4myp8N0ym7m1IERrx5zA	I've been here a few times and love it. It's a hole in the wall spot with cheap & hearty meals.   I've had breakfast here and the amount of food they give you is awesome. Served on huge plates containing eggs, protein, hash browns and a ton of toast. Plus, they serve livermush, if you grew up liking that sort of thing :)   Also tried their steak sandwich and loved that too.   The service is average as well. They take your order and leave you alone till you need something, which I prefer. Everyone here working is nice.   Sure, it's definitely not the prettiest place to eat in Charlotte, but if you're ballin on a budget and want a big satisfying meal, come here to eat.
2	C3atCvhWKXZcB96PC8Seg	D\u00e9\u00e7u un brin de ce resto qui semblait tout \u00e0 fait int\u00e9ressant pour un petit lunch business un cran au-dessus de la moyenne. Malheureusement, la cuisine n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la hauteur. Le poisson de mon coll\u00e8gue \u00e9tait po\u00e8l\u00e9 et non grill\u00e9 tel que mentionn\u00e9 par le gar\u00e7on, mon contre-filet \u00e9tait m\u00e9dium et non pas m\u00e9dium-saignant tel que demand\u00e9, les accompagnements \u00e9taient ok sans plus... pas un d\u00e9sastre mais pas tel qu'escompt\u00e9 non plus. Et cher!!! $40 ttc pour mon addition avec une bouteille d'eau p\u00e9tillante, m\u00eame pas un verre de vin. Parlant de la liste des vins, vraiment pas beaucoup de choix au verre... D\u00e9cevant donc, consid\u00e9rant les alternatives tout pr\u00e8s.
2	t1ugaxECPCl4mAQ3bCoQtg	There weren't many options in this wing of Charlotte's airport, and we were starving, but had we read the reviews we would have skipped Stock Car Cafe. As others have noted, service was prompt and fine, but the food was so bland and boring for what you pay. I would rather have spent less for fast food and gotten the same quality for less.
2	TLwaG4tUaQrVdmXReoA	Slow disorganized service. Food is ok but nothing special. Our fries were soggy like they had sat under a heat lamp for hours. The tuna melt was dry and the eggs and sausage were dry and bland. Will not return.
4	fiqInvqozVMdc8bfVuueA	I like this place for a cheap, tasty bowl of Pho and some spring rolls that always are fresh and not skimpy on the ingredients. The decor is like some old whore who gave up trying long ago, and I am totally okay with that. Am I wowed when I come here? No. Do I always get the tight lipped mamasan who almost growls my order back at me? Yes. Do I always get good food at great prices, in a place I feel comfortable wearing track pants and a bandana at? Hells to the Yesss...
4	CL1hVshkvUBk1Y54YWmDQ	The only time I had been in Casbah was years ago watching those braver than I take down flaming shots of liquor.  Now returning about three years later, the Casbah has closed and reopened under much publicized new management.    Arriving this time for a late dinner we found the place almost entirely empty but still serving food till 10, this gave us the luxury to simply walk around and see all the beautiful designs on each floor.  Along each of the diverse floor settings you can accommodate yourself to your preference.  The main floor has the Moroccan bazaar feeling, with tile tables and a nicely woven-in bar.  The top floor consists of a large dining room prepared more elegantly full ensemble of white napkins.  Finally, the fairly small basement level has several private and romantic booths with raised floors beneath the tables as a gesture to the custom of sitting cross-legged on the floor.  Having done this tradition before, I enjoy the median the Casbah has provided, the sensation of sitting on the floor but having a bottom cushion, more pillows, and easier access to a solid table in front of you.  Often meals from this region are lengthy multiple courses that involve desserts and then coffee so sitting without much support can become uncomfortable or distracting from the food and the experience which is meant to be drawn out and savored.    Not only is the atmosphere amazing, the food is delightful.  My dish, whose real name I admittedly cannot recall, was lamb with prunes served over rice.  I substituted rice for couscous which I always find rather mundane.  The lamb was very tender and juicy and the combination of that at the prunes was surprisingly delicious.  My partner got a b'stilla, I remember that one, which is a very unique creation.  It's a flakey pie stuffed with shredded meat and vegetables with the outer layer being sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, amazing flavor combination.  The meal also came with a nice soup, a lentil and a chicken and beans both of which were also quite nice.    Overall, my experience at the Casbah was well-rounded and solid.  With gorgeous dcor and really fresh flavors in exotic dishes.  The service was also quite courteous from host, waitress, manager, even the cook from the behind the bar waived to us.  It was one of the few times I've felt like I was actually being treated, in every sense of the word, to a exquisite meal, as if I was a foreign dignitary.  This brought the whole evening together making the Casbah a truly enjoyable and complete experience.  UPDATE:  I went back to eat here about a year after the above and the food wasn't as fantastical.  Still good but not amazing.   5 to 4 it must go.
2	wPrdOJ4KJV1uLymLDpf0Q	The dining room is gorgeous with marble, mirrors, private and oversized booths. Too bad it's wasted space.  We started with curried squash soup with apple slaw, and caprese salad. The soup was highlight of the meal.    Next, we were served a filet atop mashed potatoes, drizzled with a wild mushroom sauce. The filet was cooked well. However, the cut was run of the mill. I had shrimp etouffee with fettuccine. It was the first time I came across an etouffee on a menu, I just had to try it. Sadly, this wasn't the best version of the dish. If it were, it seems I'm not a fan. The shrimp were overcooked, the pasta was sticky and the roux was heavy yet bland.  We finished with carrot cake and a chocolate dome. The carrot cake consisted of mostly frosting. WAY too sweet. The dome was fair.  Service was sluggish.
4	tkcj2x4nbTD7QSl3olAA	Great location for comfort food for wearied folks from the hospital. Cheese crisp was incredible and beans were also quite good.  Grill chef provided chopped fresh jalape\u00f1o upon request.  There are a few tweaks that would make this a regular stop for me: fix ice machine for soda fountain and liven up salsa bar.  Restaurant and restrooms were very clean.
2	qbPdJm0qOBa2aDRKi3dYRg	What do you expect? It's a McDonalds. You go here for bad coffee and even worse food. I usually get annoyed when I receive poor service, but I should temper the urge to write about it based on the location and the service they are providing.  If you want better service and/or better food, go to a Starbuck and spend a few more pennies. This is just an average run-of-the-mill McDonalds.
4	Rfexa9BiaVYkMxJQtm5A	Had brunch with my friend Adriane, an aspiring Olympian here this morning before I finally left Scottsdale, and it was pretty crowded.  Lots of trendy types in here that made me feel like I was eating somewhere in Vegas.  The omlette I had was tasty and filling and I couldn't even finish the potatoes or fruit, and since Adriane paid, the price was right!
2	nI66l5mITltog1iQRoNUg	Arrowheads Applebee's is much more enjoyable! Went to karaoke last night an it was so horrible. The dj and his crew sang most of the songs :/ there were some families after 11... I thought there had to be an age limit to be in the bar after 10? There were some annoying high school girls screaming spice girls... Help me!!!!
2	vLUAp4KtObpZUGuCqS7Uw	Stopped here one morning cause it's on my way to work.  I always see a lot of police cars there, and figure if the cops are eating there religiously then it's gotta be worth a shot.  Meh.   Honestly, after seeing them make my iced mocha with hershy's syrup I became distraught, but when I tasted it I was pleasantly suprised.  Probably the best "hershy mocha" I've ever had.     The fried egg sandwich with bacon was a cluster.  FRIED implies..  well fried, NOT SCRAMBLED.  Sorry for the caps usuage but  I was just terribly dissapointed.  My scramble stack of blandness on bread was a catastrophy.   I might come back so I can try something else and boost the rating.  They only take cash too... a bummer cause I only carry my card (so I don't spend all my cash).  The restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd, and is pretty cool little place on the inside.  The owner was very nice and the prices are low.    Meh.
4	0raJihiwX5W1aPtqq8WAA	The place is very clean and bright.  We had a 'Deal Chicken' coupon and was pleasantly surprised that the young lady at the cash register was well aware of it and knew exactly how to handle it.  It came with a very large basket of chips and the salsa bar was excellent (especially if you mix the salsa and the pico de gallo).  I had the carnitas burrito and I thought it was too dry but that is sometimes true of carnitas.  However, it was a simple fix with addition of the salsa/pico de gallo.  My wife had the scrimp tacos which  were very good.  I am not much of a fan of rice in my burrito so that was a little bit of a turn off but then again I could have probably ordered it with no rice had I known.  It was a very safe place as there were 8 policemen there for lunch!! LOL   There are better Mexican food places in Phoenix but I would certainly not mind going back if I was in the area as it was quick and the selections were plentiful.
4	0bu49A3XkWIb0s5lnKDxg	The employees at this location are extremely friendly. Only complaint I have is that they have some trouble keeping up with the high volume as far as cleanliness in the dining area. But all in all, we're pleased and continue to return when we're on the go.
2	67C0CzyLUNs4UoGRdj3hGA	Houlihans constantly underwhelms me... and by constantly, I mean the two times I've gone there.  I think that for the quality/taste of food, it's way over priced.  I have had the SW chicken wrap, which mentions jalepenos, but I found it incredibly bland.  My dad liked his sandwich... but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens, it's not that hard.  The decor is cool, I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign.
4	wJpLbFt95oXyvC1VSJ7DqA	I'm from Phoenix and new to the east valley,this place is the closest I found to replacing my beloved Happy Foods.I enjoyed there fried rice and beef & broccoli.They were also friendly, quick, and reasonable priced.
2	81utE4AMFUHj1mFTxAgZ8w	It's packed!!! it's buffet and there's food everywhere!!!  The ice cream bar lineup was 10 minutes long!!!  The food area feels a bit stuffy due to the crowds and the steam coming of the food counters.  This place is very popular, and it seems very family friendly. Lots of people, the food is decent, and there's a huge variety from sushi to salad, general tao to rosbeef, pasta to pastry, there's something for everyone, if you are craving a little bit of everything it's a good place to go.  As it is with all buffets, things tend to be sweet, greasy to help fill you up faster on less food. generally, it's quick and easy to come here, and for the price it's pretty good, however there are no stand out dishes.   All said and done, you are still gonna come here and eat, cuz we're all too greedy not to... :)
2	tJDESnyJKYS1iwHFTXTZQ	I walked in, no one was inside working. I waited about 10 minutes before someone peeked their head around the corner while I was on the way out to get a meal elsewhere. I figured, screw it, I'm already here. I want Subway. The Sandwich Artist finally appeared. Might as well get a sub. The guy working there was creepy but generally friendly (and also seemed high as a kite), but he honored our coupon even though they didn't technically "accept" them.   I've had this happen in the past at this location where the Sandwich Artist has left the building (different guy though). I'm not sure where the manager is, but s/he doesn't seem to give a crap what goes down there.
2	eSCHL5KMNHaz0V6ke8ez2g	Plusses - Plenty of parking: Fran's is located in the same strip mall with Run for your Life and Fiamma, which means there's parking galore. - Attentive waitstaff: Fran herself came over to chat with us and brought crayons for the 2 year old at our table - Ecclectic homey food: bacon wrapped tator tots?  Fried sweet corn with goat cheese ranch dressing?  Meatballs with gooey melted cheese?  Don't mind if I do. - Generous portion size: I like to eat, as does everyone I was with, and we were stuffed after our meal.   - Price: reasonable, especially considering portion size.  The seafood options are a bit more expensive, but that's to be expected.  Minusses - Odd table layout: the front room holds ~10 tables and bar seating, but as you head to the bathroom in the back, there are tables along the hallway and oddly placed near the kitchen pickup window - Menu confusion: Reading the menu, I just want to exclaim "what IS this place?"  Deviled eggs, nicoise salad, eggplant parmesan, buffalo fried chicken sandwich, and mussels (three ways: traditional, curry/coconut, or beer/bacon) all co-habitate on the menu.  On one hand, that might mean everyone can find something they like.  On the other hand, it's just weird.  What does Fran's want to be when it grows up?   - Food quality & flavors: it's not bad, but it's not amazing either.  The macaroni & cheese side was bland, the lamb ragu was not as good as it had been talked up to be, the chicken milanese was just so-so.  However, the goat cheese was incredible; the goat cheese ranch dressing is a wonderful little cup of surprise (dunk all the way to the bottom, and you'll be rewarded with chunks of soft goat cheese.  You're welcome) and the goat cheese salad that came with the chicken milanese was my favorite of the whole meal.  Moral of the story: if it has goat cheese, GET IT.
4	yGOXzVVdTenUO1x6HoXLKw	for those on a grad student budget like myself, hemingway's is perfect beginning at 11am and then again after 9pm for the 1/2 price food. i would definitely not pay full price for any of the food on the menu but i could literally come here for dinner every night for $3.50. not to mention, the drinks are cheap.   perfect place to pre-game or spend your whole weekday/night
2	UlSHzNAOe2k0UVVX7T26NA	My wife and I just got home from a long flight and wanted some Chinese for dinner on a Sunday night. Not wanting to go to a buffet and over eat bland dishes...we thought we'd try this local place. Well...I wish we didn't! Although I am going to give them two stars for the cleanliness and friendly greeting...that's about where it ends. I tried the cashew chicken and my wife tried the sweet & sour chicken. I refuse to order a drink from places that only serve cans of over priced soda, but my wife had a .99 cent can of 7UP. As for the food...my dish was way too hot (still steaming 15 mins later, the chicken at times had globs of fat on it, and every so often I would find bits of other dishes in it. I ate about 1/3 of my large order and threw the rest out. My wife thought her sweet & sour chicken was so-so, and the rice that came with our order was very dry and tasteless. I want to close with the menu had NO General Tao or Sesame Chicken! Two very common staples! In closing the place is clean, and people nice, but you can do much better for even average Chinese food.
2	LJZOl5DBejrTDcMKLBTMw	Walked in 15 minutes before they close and two workers  Irwin & Savana say I can only get ice creme cause they are closing.    Then close at 830.    After complaining about it she made me an orange julious out of what she was tossing out.   I watched her make it,  no spit....    Haha.   And NO TIP either
4	7AmWvGDHxXQ9jp3XPIaUw	I always enjoy the food here. The wings are good! I like the skin has that crisp to it.  They serve Blue Moon by the pitcher which is rad when with a group (or alone haha)  The food really is excellent. I used to know a bartender here he was cool.  I would have it 5 stars BUT some of the waitresses are idiots and seem to mess up every single thing you order.  They always correct it for free but it is annoying!
4	KF8DbvmS8eB4jBBtvh9w	I've eaten here many a time, and I think the pho is delicious.  There is something very 'fresh' about it.    That said, there is nothing attractive about the atmosphere or the staff.  They can hardly be said to be friendly, and the place has an almost septic feel.  Either way, everyone I've brought there has loved the food, so the atmosphere probably shouldn't factor in.    Great for lunch.
4	po8S8tuzra6X7Oq6wgUSw	Since the Bojs in Midtown was closed, this location was a short drive away to get our Boj fix.  Went through the drive-thru, but the staff was nice and patient since it took a while deciding on what to stuff our faces with.  It was late in the evening (8:30ish) but the biscuits were still fresh and the chicken was just what we needed.  The fries that came with my cajun fillet biscuit were just what I wanted.  This location has the perfect seasoning/fry ratio that makes you sad when you reach the bottom of the bag and see that you are all out in about 5 seconds.  I do have a special place in my heart for Popeye's, but living "down south" I have definitely come to love the tradition that is Bojangles.
4	Adwjk8IGEizNv2gEXPviA	We have been Pan China diners since they opened and the food has always been great but lately I have to say stay away from the egg rolls! A good egg roll is a wonderful thing but it seems they are using some frozen cardboardy things with very little filling. We've gotten to the point of picking up entrees here and our egg rolls at....wait for it....Jack-in-the-Box!
2	7n8z7koldmv1gbO064zLw	We were really excited that Say Sushi re-opened, but after we came by on a Sunday and they were closed we were disappointed. We wanted to support our small town and have dinner in town so we decided to try again. Tonight the place was busy with only one server. He was running around like crazy trying to help as best he could. We ordered a dinner salad and didn't finish half. The old dressing was rememberable, this was week and dry. Our sushi came and it wasn't horrible, but the rice was a little dry.   When I went to the bathroom, the sink did not have hot water and was a little dirty.  This place used to be a inexpensive choice with great quality food. Now their prices are the same as going to RA but without the atmosphere.  I don't know if we will be back!
2	h4GcXB9dSYzI8rzdnAfsw	Terrible.  Paid $6 a person to get in so we could hear some live music.  Well, the band came on an hour late, would play fr one song, LITERALLY ONE SONG, and then take a break.  And they sucked.  There are so many better places to go in the area.  Skip this bar.
2	GunWVDxk4lhDqkNqNSfxQ	We came here after seeing 4 stars on yelp. We must have come on a really bad night. This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot & sour soup was too spicy to eat and I could only taste pepper. The fried shrimp & egg roll with the meal was swimming in grease-very old grease. We took about two bites of our orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken before deciding it was too gross to eat. It only gets 2 stars because the workers were super nice!
2	q61UdliluCTQBTxeS9YBoA	I order from this Pizza Hut every single week. For the past two weeks, the driver has had to call me because he has no idea where they're going AND my order has been wrong!! I get it being busy and that there are new drivers, but come on! If it's happened to me two weeks in a row, how many people deal with it usually. I didn't get my Asiago crust and THATS THE BEST PART!!!
2	84gHDuFTKIClgcXFXdCg	Extremely overpriced buffet, with low food quality. The brunches are ok after a late night... waffle machines, on-demand omelets, cereal, and donuts/sweets. Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman 15 very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I may've eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and that's totally ok with me.
2	vVGpqYkPH5jSmB2WM9ew	2's little harsh, it's more like 2.5.  I smelled bleach as soon as I sat down at a booth near restroom. But that was only a warning sign. While my friends seemed to enjoy their omelet and benedict for brunch, my so-called Belgian Waffle suffered from a serious identity crisis. I want to know what was Belgian Waffle about it.   What I got was a pale colored, flavorless slab with out-of can syrup/juice immersed soggy mess. Wow, really. How could you do that to a plate of waffle?  The service was ok. Pleasant, but without a charm. The place gets busier with after-church crowd on Sunday. So timing is a key.
2	RiFlAsJAkJBa3rWKosxwQ	Used to get combos meals a lot, but lately I've only getting the food from the 99 cents menu.  All the hamburger portions are so tiny, don't really think it's worth the money eating here anymore.  Frosty drink is always good, no matter what size you get, I can never get enough of it.
4	fcJ24UVala70qu3SQV57w	In short, this place serves up super tasty Italian food and pizza with local hospitality and charm.  After receiving several recommendations for Portofino's, we finally got around to sampling their fare.  I ordered my standard Italian dish, lasagna bolognese, and my wife ordered a plain cheese pizza.  The lasagna was very good but that pizza?  Oh man, did I order wrong!  I could not stop asking her for just one more bite.  Be aware that this place is like a local version of a Carrabba's or a Macaroni Grill, only with MUCH better food and no cheesy artificial flair.  If you want a family friendly joint to serve up some great tomato sauce and cheese, this is the place.
2	CZLUCtPeZ8gKNmFoRgTQ	Don't get the fries! Burgers were fresh and about what you'd expect for a $6 burger. The free peanuts are a plus. If you do order fries, expect to eat to eat about 2 lbs of soggy grease potatoes. Somehow, the fryer temperature is never high enough to make nice crispy fries.
2	vWY4yREMktDYxzz8wwAcA	Since we've moved here Jim 'N Nick's has continued to disappoint us.  At first this place was great.  Good food, good portions.  But lately they have been skimping on their portion sizes.  Once my husband mentioned the change in portions and his waitress basically flipped out saying they haven't changed.  Last night was the last night we are going to Jim 'N Nicks.  The sandwiches have shrunk, the mac n cheese (which use to be delicious) was horrible.  We will now go to Mac's Speedshop for our BBQ cravings.
4	4tPXcCjHtXfSHwyQ16jw	Great Pizza, great pasta. My family has eaten here many time and the food quality and service have been consistently top notch. It is a relatively small "hole-in-the-wall" family restaurant and the staff has always been very friendly. Recently, I placed a very large carry-out order on short notice, and everything was perfect and ready at the exact time I requested. I highly recommend.
4	T1Lu6UeSHH6AZmzl9pnz7w	I had great service here today. I stopped in for a snack before I went to the grocery store and the cashier was very attentive. She noticed me waiting for the bathroom as another employee cleaned it, and she paged in and let him know. He held the door for me. I appreciate that both employees went above and beyond in the little things. After, I got my onion ring snack and they were crispy and hot.
2	CdofWTGZoOXNcPLmXKPgsQ	Service has gone down and I don't think I will ever go back due to a discrepancy with the bill.  I'm not going to risk having somebody spit in my food. It's been a long time since I had to walk in the back and ask for a coffee refill. Felt like cashier lady was trying to take advantage of me because the server screwed up the order. Manager make things right only after some argument and me stating that I felt like I was being swindled. It did feel like I was being put together after poor service. People who were seated after me had their meal before me. Food was okay.
4	zABSypriqMwCaPmX75ZtaQ	always liked fudruckers, my favorite is a cajun chicken sandwich. have not been on their menu for a while. it's a grilled chicken sandwich with grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, and a cajun sauce. this has been my favorite for years. of course you have to have their fries with the jalapeno cheese sauce. this location is a little dirty, but they have a lot of customers coming in and out. had a great meal with the family.
2	gItKQueBtDpbQI0GwxjQ	The prices, at first glance, look decent but that's just how they pull you in. They nickel and dime you on everything else. What started as a $12 order of 20 wings turned out to be a $19 order. All we ordered was two drinks and two ranches in addition. I ordered the Garlic and Parmesan and my partner ordered the Cajun. His turned out ok, but mine were a wreck. I expected a wing sauce with garlic and parmesan. All I got was my group of wings doused in parmesan and just a light brushing of plain garlic. No sauce whatsoever. When I say soused I mean DOUSED. I had to ask for a little side of plain wing sauce to make them edible, for which they charged me 69 cents! Bottom line is this place was very disappointing when for the same price I could've gone to Little Caesars and bought three pizzas AND an order of wings. Very overrated.
2	ggr9TDU0bVnZBEsiObxYEQ	Firstly, letme agree with Stephanie T. This place is far from 'rapid' at any time of the day. Whether there is a huge queue forming out of the door or just you in the whole shop, you will wait for what seems like an eternity before you are eventually served. Although to give credit where credit is due, the actual preperation time of the sandwiches is fairly quick - which may explain why they always look a bit messy and sloppy. However, once you stop being shallow about your food, the sandwiches here are actually pretty damn tasty and good value for what you pay for them.
2	b1kLsgl6nc2blZXRAGjXw	Been there on several Friday nights and the food is less then stellar.  Over priced with very little flavor.  Never had anything that I would want to order again.  The value is not there to make us wanting to come back and eat again.   Entertainment with Rags Allen is one of the best in the valley.   Very limited menu without a great selection and choices.   Coconut Shrimp is just that,  shrimp in size and not much to eat.  I have the Pork Chile Verde and it was filled with rice without a good flavor.  My advise,  Eat Elsewhere.
2	tV7u6NrHHzsxPS6l6jfbA	Ambiance was nice.  Service was nice.  Drinks were good.  I had a green tea martini, pricey at $15 but normal for Vegas.  Food was..."ok".  Way too pricey for what you are getting.  We left hungry.  I wouldn't go back to eat a meal but would go back for drinks /appetizers if nothing else was open.
4	f6tlchzyvHAwY0QbO3wQ	Love the roll, meat us very good, and you can add oil, vinegar, spices etc. However, for the love of god will you PLEASE get regular dill pickle chips for the sandwiches.  I know you can get a whole kosher pickle, but I like the dark green dills!  The hunter club and the porker are my favs.
2	5Q7o6s1bRU7vBRB5a9yGEQ	I don't know why I keep coming here. Even if it down the street where I work. Every time I go in I get treated like I'm not even there. Personal conversations and people in plain clothes walking around where the food food is being prepared just doesn't seem right.
4	uEiy6CvEOWo04kN1wdJZtg	Oh man, four words: homemade stuffed grape leaves. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE canned ones too (there are maybe 5-6 brands here to choose from, if you'd rather) but of all the falafel shops I've frequented, I've never had homemade. Exciting.   Falafel is tasty, if a bit small (every city has their own style, it's interesting to me that Charlotte's is the roll-up rather than the pita-stuff) so make sure to grab one of their sides: tabouleh, babaganoush, and homemade samosas (!) all make me very happy. A drink, sammich and side will run you about 8 bucks.   Also of note: huge jars of pickles run about 5 bucks (a steal) and the olive bar is terrific. It's on the floor. Don't be skeered. Another first for me: a rack of pre-made Injera. Awesome!
4	jV8aDYrQ4LFHb0b0hC3Iw	As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the sweetest Filipino Aunty EVER! I've been to plenty of Filipino food places with shady people trying to nickel and dime you for everything.  But Aunty straight hooked me up with extra rice, and sabow (soup), to go with my two choice meal.  She made me feel at home, like I was her long lost nephew, and it was her extra TLC that made the efood that much better.  If she doesn't have something ready, she will cook it on the spot!  But if you're smart, you'll call ahead to make sure the food will be ready for you once you get there!  If I'm craving some Filipino food in Vegas, I'd definitely swing by here for some good home style food and special family treatment.
4	v6pqzYfd7XFM4t6fWI1wQA	This place is gonna cost me about $2,000.  ---- Back story, I was backpacking around South America a few years ago and spent a few weeks in Ecuador. Loved it. Great place.  Of course I ate Ecuadorian food but don't remember much about it.   Now after eating at MCMP I figure it's gonna be about $2,000 for me to go back to Ecuador and try the real stuff again so I can compare the two.  Anyways, loved the oatmeal drink. It tasted like pineapple juice with a hint of spice or cinnamon. Chips and salsa were standard issue.  The two dinners we had were very good. One was like a spicy carne asada, the other was sort of a combo plate with beef, beans, two types of plantains, sausage, egg, rice and chichron.  Our entrees were fine, but I'm really excited to try the other items on the menu.  Empanadas, tamales, and the chiviche looked really good.  This place has about 6-8 tables that's it. Only one person to serve everyone so if the place is packed expect a few more minutes for everything.
