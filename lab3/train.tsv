4	z8DDztUxuIoHYHddDL9zQ	So let me set the scene first, My church social group took a trip here last saturday. We are not your mothers church. The churhc is Community Church of Hope, We are the valleys largest GLBT church so when we desended upon Organ stop Pizza, in LDS land you know we look a little out of place. We had about 50 people from our church come and boy did we have fun.  There was a baptist church a couple rows down from us who didn't see it coming. Now we aren't a bunch of flamers frolicking around or anything but we do tend to get a little loud and generally have a great time. I did recognized some of the music  so I was able to sing along with those.  This is a great place to take anyone over 50.  I do think they might be washing dirtymob money or something since the business is cash only.........which I think caught a lot of people off guard including me.  The show starts at 530  so dont be late !!!!!!
2	BIeDBg4MrEd1NwWRlFHLQQ	Decent but terribly inconsistent food. I've had some great dishes and some terrible ones, I love chaat and 3 out of 4 times it was great, but once it was just a fried greasy mess (in a bad way, not in the good way it usually is.) Once the matar paneer was great, once it was oversalted and the peas were just plain bad. I don't know how they do it, but it's a coinflip between good food and an oversalted overcooked bowl.  Either way, portions are generous.
4	NJHPiW30SKhItD5E2jqpHw	Looks aren't everything.......  This little divito looks a little scary looking, but like I've said before "you can't judge a book by it's cover".   Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date (unless she's blind and hungry), but man oh man is the food ever good!   We have ordered breakfast, lunch, & dinner, and it is all fantastico. They make home-made corn tortillas and several salsas. The breakfast burritos are out of this world and cost about the same as a McDonald's meal.   We are a family that eats out frequently and we are frankly tired of pretty places with below average food. This place is sure to cure your hankerin for a tasty Mexican meal.
2	nnS89FMpIHz7NPjkvYHmug	Being a creature of habit anytime I want good sushi I go to Tokyo Lobby.  Well, my group wanted to branch out and try something new so we decided on Sakana. Not a fan.  And what's shocking to me is this place was packed!  The restaurant opens at 5:30 on Saturday and we arrived at around 5:45 and were lucky to get the last open table.  I don't get it...  Messy rolls that all tasted the same.  We ordered the tootsie roll and the crunch roll, both tasted similar, except of course for the crunchy captain crunch on top.  Just a mushy mess, that was hard to eat.  Bland tempura.  No bueno.  I did, however, have a very good tuna poke salad, but I would not go back just for that.   If you want good sushi on the west side, or the entire valley for that matter, say no to Sakana and yes to Tokyo Lobby.
2	FYxSugh9PGrX1PR0BHBIw	I recently told a friend that I cant figure out why there is no good Mexican restaurants in Tempe. His response was what about MacAyo's? I responded with "why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?"  Seriously if anyone out there knows of any legit Mexican in Tempe let me know. And don't say restaurant Mexico!
4	ScViKtQ2xq6i5AyN4curYQ	Chevy's five years ago was crisp and fresh and the salsa was great. The tortillas were hot and fresh and the staff engaging. It was a lovely place to have fun. Then it took a nose dive in every single area and it didn't seem to care. Quality and service and food, man we had some nasty times and stopped visiting. We thought fresh my ***. If you had made a suggestion of going to Chevy's I would roll my eyes. Thanks but no thanks.  On a lark, maybe desperation, we went back this weekend. They have updated the menu, the staff, the service and the place is back functioning again. I asked management what happened and they divulged the handling of parent company Pepsi was a disaster for the Chevy's branding and they have been sold to new people. It shows.  If you used to enjoy Chevy's and then over the past few years stopped, then it's time to go back. The fire shrimp is back, the service is back, the machino is working and things remind me of when I first tried them out. We were full, and satisfied. If you have any issues with your new experience they are listening now. Welcome Back Chevy's.
2	vz8Q37FSlypZlgy5N7Ym0A	Every time I go to this Jack In The Box I get approached by a homeless person, either inside or outside.  I will stop going to this location. Nothing wrong with the food or service.    Save for people begging for money.
4	OJuG2EvItSZXbu8KowI9A	I've been going to Cluckers for years. Every time I'm back home in Charlotte I find myself here frequently. It's a solid restaurant with good food. Best thing to do (when with friends) is order the family meal. You get salad, rice, fries, pita bread and loads of chicken. I leave stuffed and happy. Just be careful when adding coca-cola to the mix as you'll want to be near a toilet. I'll always remember going to Cluckers ages ago and changing the "Welcome" sign when you walked in. It took lots of careful effort and hard labor but after many visits we had successfully changed the sign from "Welcome to Cluckers!" to "Welcome you F**kers!" They didn't notice for a week till someone complained.
4	k9ci6SfI5RZT3smNdnvSg	.                                               sandwiches and                       Capriotti's steak                             I  am           one  of                                                                still full I had                                                                                       4 hours later. I guess            it's a                                                                               medium.                    good thing                                                   not the                                      that I ordered                sandwich                                                         the small  Filling and delicious but not for the faint of heart.  Urp.  Mmm, sweet peppers.
4	qq6bQbrBZyd4lOBd8KSCoA	Well, after their remodel the place no longer smells like a toilet!  And they did some other things right too.  The food - definitely stepped up at least a notch if not two. I go here for their unlimited soup/ salad combos. They have regular and premium salads(in smaller portions) which are unlimited, and you can swap and try different combos of soups and salads.($5.99 and $7.99 I believe are the prices for the regular salads vs premium salads). Premium gets your the asian salad, spinach bacon and something else. I like they added low-calorie/ more WW friendly items too which are pretty tasty. I tried their jalapeno shrimp grilled plate which was flavorful but not spicy. And I like spicy. So for all the bland people this is probably more aimed for you.  I'd put it as a 1 chilli from Arribas or the baja spicy from Macayo's... doesn't touch los dos though with a pinky though.  The beer is still ice cold, and although they changed their prices recently (they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing) they are still really good for happy hour.  There are a lot of regulars here for happy hour from what I've seen which can get loud.  Overall they've taken a step away from their old drive bar scene and brought it back to a decent place to eat and have a good time.
4	FldFfwfuk9T8kvkp8iw	Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.
4	63ufCUqbPcnl6abC1SBpvQ	Ihop is my favorite breakfast chain, and the service at this location is outstanding.  Blanca, our server, was amazing. She is friendly and made sure my husband's eggs were perfectly over-medium.  My "Pick a Pancake" combo with the New York Cheesecake pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and extra-crispy hashbrowns got my day off to a great start.  Great location by Sunset Station!
4	nDYCZDIAvdcx77EcmYz0Q	A very good Jewish deli tucked in and amongst the small factories and warehouses on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret.   There were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago.   The amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly.   I failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH. Since the in-laws live here, that's definitely going to happen.
4	uoC1llZumwFKgXAMlDbZIg	Went here for lunch with Rand H. and this place is big for a chinese buffet , it is in the shell of an old Sizzler. The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average.they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good..So yes i would go back even though it is not one of my favorite chinese buffet but it is a good one.
2	BBs1rbz75dDifvoQyVMDg	Picture the least attractive person you'd settle for if you were drunk and desperate.  Replace 'person' with 'restaurant' and The Coffee Shop seriously tests this minimum standard.  Open 24 hours, this place has a comically bipolar menu.  Hmm, how do I decide between Trout Almondine, Teriyaki Glazed Pacific Salmon Bowl, and a Stuffed Philly Cheese Steak Potato?  Yeah...I didn't...I chose the pancakes w/ bananas and caramelized almonds.  Not bad.  Factor in the lame Denny's like atmosphere and you should really avoid being drunk and desperate enough to eat here.  Note:  They have an offshoot neighbor that specializes in Pho.  Weird.  But I would try that in a hearbeat before going back here.  That's open 3 AM on Friday/Saturday and midnight on Sunday-Thursday.
4	2t9znjapzhioLqb4Pf1Q	Really really really strong Margaritas!   The happy hour menu makes everything really cheap, and the food at night is great. I got the calamari...and it comes with this wonderful wasabi-cream sauce...YUM!  The only issue I would say, is that it stops serving at 11pm. With that great of a bar, it should stay open a little later.
4	GqLgixGcbWh51IzkwsiswA	I would not have known about this place had it not been for the Holiday Groupon. I redeemed mine with my bf over the weekend, and the food was delicious and cooked well (see Holiday Groupon pic).  The restaurant was packed on Saturday night; I'm glad I called in a reservation. Local town folk. Not a huge place but still cozy. The servers were running around and busy but made sure that our table was attended well. Ask for Dee Dee; she's a trip! I'll be back again for more food once the snow has melted to try the other items on the menu.
4	Tk6ekSIyRLcDZdacrn6b0w	Peppi's rocks! Why do I say that you ask? Let me explain..   I was walking down Smithfield during my Friday lunch, which is later than my lunch during the rest of the week & I'm realllllly hungry!  I head down to Peppi's after hearing so many people rave about it.   While walking into Peppi's I think I took a step back in time because every worker is literally jamming to "Funky Town" & I'm at a dive sandwich shop. All of the workers were extremely friendly & happy (what's your secret?! I need to know!)   The cheese steak was delish & I'm pretty excited that I can get grilled onions without an awkward up charge. A cheese steak, fresh cut fries & a drink comes to around $8-9.. extremely reasonable. I ended up only eating half of the hoagie & enjoyed the rest later in the day.   The staff were chatting & joking with me again as I was leaving. I must say for a lunch by myself I laughed a great deal during that hour. I'll be back!
2	i2ApGrPQwDVNMztkdyoEEA	Not a bad place but there are many others in Charlotte that are better. We where seated at a table so close to another couple that we might as well have eaten dinner with them. So if you are looking for atmosphere, not your place.    Don't get me wrong Lavecchia's isn't bad it just isn't up to par with some of the other nice spots in CLT.
4	XIPr67UlZNcaKSyQvR7VEw	This is my favorite mexican food place ever!!  I rated a 4 because its only good in the day time. After about 4pm it seems it been sitting too long, otherwose id probably eat there way too much.  The xaviers special burrito is amazing as well as their salsa.  Id def recommend xaviers to anyone looking for good mexican food.  My only suggestions would be to upgrade appliances, remodel, expand and open on sundays!
2	YT9tezwopYagEjTxIzN2dg	i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza. i hate the sweet sauce, i hate that the ingredients are under the cheese so they don't get crunchy and crispy, the pepperoni is floppy. just not for me. the crust was kinda gooey like.   my delivery was 30 minutes late but its ok bc i wasn't in a hurry. they were really nice i just can't stand this kind of pizza.    if you like the sweet sauce and toppings under the cheese then go for it bc you'll probably love it!
4	Pq7boJt6iYwDy8gzjXwfrA	This location is consistently great with their customer service! My wife and I come here 2-3 times per month and we are always satisfied with the quality of the food and ice cream! They have a customer appreciation day once per year and the total is half off! The only thing that could make this location any better is if the employees smiled more
2	BW49XqnuS8I2O6ug0P2x5w	don't really mind waiting lines, or employees, however, took a bite out of the burger and found a hard little crunchy plastic straw like thing in the cheeseburger. I killed that cheeseburger still though cuz i was pretty hungry lmao. I ordered 2 Jr. cheeseburgers, 6 nuggets, fries and without a drink. Try eating a burger without a drink, it's hard, try swallowing a plastic thing (which I'm glad I didn't) without a drink. I'm just glad I lived to see another day and chewed my food. Lol I bit into the plastic thing and it bent a little. It didn't break. Just a mistake that could of happened anywhere.
2	BLp2xYKVGWfYLJSnd2FuA	Floyd's is interesting. I came here once when I was doing a selling gig of mine during the summer and I came back to try their food. So I came in for lunch for a take out as my brother and as well as a few friends came down from Raleigh wanted to try it out. I ordered the stew beef as well as doubled the side of the mac n cheese.  Let's just say, if you're going to work out or do anything active in the few to several hours dont. Because I was burping that stuff up and it just didn't feel good. But, that's southern food for you. I felt that the mac-n-cheese was a little watery and wasn't cheesy enough. The stew beef was okay, I guess. The problem with that was it was also too watery and it had no flavor. I was thinking that it would give me a punch because, well it's in a stew.   I think I won't come back here for a while, especially since the aftermath of the meal was horrible. I think when you eat something, the process of eating it and the aftermath is wrapped into one! If you do come here, I suggest you to order the chicken as I heard it wasn't bad. From my experience though, stay away from the stew beef.
2	1ZSIRYJEWZt0oPThsdIlw	All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up.  Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par.  Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas.
4	zgz0RhbqPJMFhfyT3guC5g	First visit was for lunch about a year ago, and I tried one of their specialty noodle dishes (#100) and didn't enjoy it.  I was partly to blame since I only enjoy whole wheat and gourmet pastas, and rice and egg noodles either do not satisfy me, or I feel too guilty to enjoy eating them.  So I avoided the noodles and concentrated on the filling and found it blah.  I've since had Siamese Cat take-out twice in the past two weeks.  The household enjoyed the following very much:  #24 Rama w/ Beef (cabbage and peanut sauce topped w/ crispy egg noodles and red onion) #27 Gaeng Keao Wan w/ Chicken (coconut green curry w/ green bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil) #30 Gaeng Ped  w/ Chicken (red coconut curry w/ carrots, peas, bamboo shoots, and basil) #103 Pad Pak Gratiem Prik Thai (chicken w/ pepper, fresh garlic, and "chef's sauce")  I am a fan of green curry of nany Thai restaurants (I'm told by a close Thai coworker/friend of mine that Thai curries are some of the easiest foods to prepare), but not this one. SC serves it with bamboo shoots, green bell pepper, basil, and coconut milk.  Green bell pepper (part of the nightshade family of plants and contains solanine, a glycoalkaloid that can trigger pain) is an inflammatory food, and since I'm allergic to many foods, I try to stay away from as many pro-inflammatory foods as I can.  Perhaps my slight aversion to green bell pepper (though I do like the flavor this item delivers in many recipes) mars my enjoyment of this dish since it plays such a major role here.  My only complaint with SC for now is that the entrees are a little too salty.  Otherwise, I'm a fan!    BTW, deep-frying greatly decreases the glycoalkaloid content of nightshade plant foods... french fries and fried green tomatoes, anyone?  Too bad, fried foods can also trigger inflammation in blood vessels, among other symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders/diseases...
2	HmnXFsJnPDLSL9TSL5NxVA	We were hungry and not willing to wait to cook or for restaurant service so we decided to grab some Subway on our way home.  At the last minute we changed our minds and got Kyoto Bowl instead.  The husband was a little over-enthusiastic to try it and I warned him to keep his expectations low, but not as low as Yoshinoya Beef Bowl low, ugh.  Anyway, we walk in, and as expected the place is decorated like every other Kyoto Bowl with ugly white tiles and ugly white benches.  There is too much white, and considering the location, it was more like grey.  They also had two fish tanks for me to stare at while waiting for our order.  One of them was half drained and the other had half a dozen tetras swimming around.  Real fancy.  Anyway, I got the Teriyaki Chicken and an egg roll because nothing else really sounded good.  There isn't a lot to choose from anyway.  The husband got the Orange Chicken.  My Teriyaki chicken was just meh.  The chicken was a little overcooked and the sauce was so bland.  I figured for sure I would get a tasty, over-garlicky sauce here, but no.  The egg roll was okay, a little soggy though.  I also found it a bit odd that the meat inside the egg roll was beef.  I thought pork was the norm.  Anyway, this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for.
2	BNeKJrIgWlDx080vrb25IA	Oh Amelio's, I remember you from years ago when we used to order pizza's from you almost every Tuesday night, to take advantage of your buy 1 get 1 free pizza special. I haven't had an Amelio's pie in years, so I decided to try them out again by ordering up a large extra cheese & some breadsticks.  The large cheese pizza tasted ok, but parts of the pizza had absolutely no crust on the end of the slices, it was like eating flatbread pizza with the crust chopped off. C'mon guys, no crust, rly?  The extra cheese also seemed to be concentrated on just 2 of the 8 slices of the pie, which was disappointing.   The breadsticks were tasty, but the sauces were way too small to accomodate all the breadsticks.   Amelio's, please make your pizzas better and quit skimping on the sauce sides.
4	BA9PWEztULnZ660OZfjrA	In the almost-3 years I've lived in Las Vegas, I've seen new Roberto's locations pop up all over the place.  One thing to remember is that many of the stores are owned by different people, and the quality and menu definitely vary from store to store.  For some reason, the green salsa at this place is WAY hotter than it is at the other locations I've been too.  Huh.  This Roberto's is the closest to where I live, and it has always been pretty good.  The carne asada is so-so, the breakfast burritos are okay, but I've found that the carnitas here are better than other Roberto's locations.  When you order the carnitas they quickly fry them to a crisp right before putting them in the burrito or taco.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
4	2Yli37K68wl4tv3c4qo7A	Great General Tso tofu - I always get it extra spicy and extra crispy and they always do it right! Lo Mein is not greasy and has a large quantity of veggies!  Only downfall is that the woman is extremely hard to understand via phone and on weekend nights, the delivery is on the slow side (we had only 3 items, took 50 minutes Saturday night around 10pm)
2	TuL9hwVpnqWPB6JM1sBT4A	I had greater hopes for Little Szechuan over the nearby Mr. Hunan as the latter is simply a carry out joint. However, despite the nice colorful dining room, the food at Little Szechuan was fairly bland. I suppose theoretically these two Chinese joints specialize in the regional cuisine of their names, but there is little difference in menu or taste.   One thing I will say is that my waitress was extraordinarily nice at Little Szechuan. I was studying Arabic at the time and we had a really friendly, fun conversation about language. She helped make an incredibly dull meal an actually rewarding experience.
2	OUXkI2P1Imgg14Vu02PS2g	This location has really bad customer service they had me waiting in line by myself for close to 20 mins with a full staff behind the counter with each person just staring and telling me be right with you sir. I would understand if it were a busy time and the rush to get orders ready were really bad but I was the only customer in the store. I would recommend going to another location to get your kfc.
4	D6UH98Mc7S5IyY0NbnlDMw	Outback is a chain resturant ~ so they have their formula perfected.  Each time we hav eaten at OUTBACK we have had a great dinner and good service.  Lately each time we try to eat at OUTBACK there has been a 20 to 30 minute wait  ~ we don't always wait . .  .but it's wonderful to know that things are picking up and that there are quality resturants that have waiting line ~ to me this is a blessings.  : )KC
2	QbiN14d6Dxyfmgyv8Ftfgw	Ana's review is spot-on. There is nothing here that isn't done much better at other Italian places in town. Only the fact that this place is so cheap keeps it afloat.   This is the Boyardee, (as opposed to the Boiardi) type of Italian food. Its Italian for people who pronounce it "Eye-talian", without a hint of irony and think of garlic and basil as ethnic spices.  1 star for the food and campy decor, 1 star for the prices that make a step towards redeeming it.
4	0oiO19kCiVoe1WrpbGGWGg	This place is always empty, and I do not see why?  The Triple Prime burgers are fantastic, and well prices. The french fries are also great. This is one of my fav places to eat burgers, and I am not a supporter of chains. I ate here on a whim one day, and was very impressed.  If you are a burger fan (and by that I mean someone who like a burger that tastes great without a ton of toppings, you enjoy the beef) order the Triple Prime burger, you will love it.  As one reviewer also noted, they have a large selection of really good lemonades and teas, and they are not the usual chain variety.   Overall I really enjoy the quiet, good service.
2	nMkHdKoqRtc7DweanM4voA	I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday before work. I knew I wanted some nuggets and maybe fries. I got to the window and ordered nuggets. I wanted a second to decide if I wanted the full meal or anything else but the girl in the drive thru rushed me so I decided not to get anything other than the nuggets. I know it's "fast" food and ideally I should come through the drive thru and already know what I want to buy, but I wasn't going to spend more than 2 minutes looking at the menu and deciding. It wasn't even busy, there was no one behind me and this location has two speakers. Even when I went to pay she was in too much of a hurry and practically threw my change at me. I won't go out of my way to come here again. I ended up going to Burger King for a whopper and fries a few hours later. If  the girl at the window had been a little more patient then I probably would have just gotten a full meal and drink from McDonalds.  2 Stars because the girl at the second window was nice and the nuggets weren't bad.
4	xdE5XDfqKmfONY68gJZsiA	This is the one shop that comes to my mind when I want a sandwich. Quite possibly my favorite lunch...the Jazz, Poor Brothers Jalapeno chips, a cute little chocolate chip cookie, and a Mr. Pibb. In fact, I had that today! Awesome.
2	mUfowcquHDvf4c0BpT0Q	Edit:  I don't like this place anymore!  Last experience- the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want (and so less pad thai).  Also service was really slow for lunch.  It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares.
2	fQi8k51RGNRao5hGOemdNg	A lot of people (girls) I know love this place, but to me it seems like much of the same in Uptown Charlotte: it's crowded, loud, and a little over-the-top. Again, though, as I've always said: this isn't always a bad thing.   On Thursdays through Sundays, this place is pretty packed with twenty-somethings and maybe braver older adults looking to booze and get after it, probably before hitting a louder/dancier place nearby. There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers), so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more.   I've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome, so if you're into that you may wanna try them. And they usually have some great deals on those, so be sure to check that out.
4	koyFufkTgALgWzferzBwA	All PPP have the same layout.  This one I have to say is cleaner than the others.  Kids are everywhere!!!  The pizza was not bad.  The wings are not too bad either.  They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time.
2	UL7paBr613QTxNi06dNYQ	Im a regular at this location. My roomate orders from them 2-3 times a week, I order maybe one a week or two. I've never had any complaints. I call, because the tracker said my pizza was on its way 30 minutes ago and I live a block away. I tell her my pizza arrived cold and burnt. My buffalo wings with no sauce. She tells me in order for her to give me a order that isn't...defective that she'll need to see the order for herself. She won't believe me till she has the driver who took 30 minutes to drive a block pick it back up, take it there, look at it to make sure its to her (apparently low) standard then decide if she wants to either send me back my cold order or a new one. This is ridiculous, I work at a pizza place, I've never treated a customer as if they were lying to me.
4	B70qwxu0wA39PJrOWa2Qtg	Not bad Chinese food at all - we came here for Sunday dimsum which was pretty decent.  Service was decent, dim sum was good but there were some dishes that I was a bit disappointed by, but the ones that were pretty satisfactory included the spareribs in black bean sauce, beef tripe, bean curd, and the shrimp shui mi.  Just a tip - be careful of which tea that you end up pouring - for some reason, I ended up with a cup full of hot sugar water.  And oh, yeah - they don't take card so make sure that you have cash with you.
2	4FOh6sm9Ju9x1k6FWGZ5Q	Old Hickory House is not very far from my work, so I decided to have lunch there one day.  When I stepped in, I was transported back in time.  The look of the restaurant, with its wood panel walls and Western Sizzlin-esque decor was definitely an interesting touch.    There were fewer than 10 people there, so a waitress immediately came and took my drink order while I mulled over the menu.  I finally decided on the pork and beef plate (I requested the pork be chopped and the beef be sliced), with BBQ beans and hush puppies as the sides.  Apparently you can request the BBQ sauce to be on the side, but I neglected to do so.  Less than 5 minutes later, my food came out.    The beef was sliced between 1/8" and 1/4" thick, and the texture of it reminded me more of roast beef than a beef brisket.  There was no smoke flavor to it whatsoever.  The taste was okay -- not really overwhelming or remarkable.    The pork was finely chopped.  The bites I managed to take without sauce on it were okay -- again, nothing really remarkable.  The sauce didn't really do much for me.  It almost seemed like a sort of tomato-ish gravy.  The beans were bland, and there were pieces of pork dispersed within the beans.  That's all I'll say about that.  The best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the hush puppies.  With the exception of one rogue hush puppy (that was probably from a much earlier batch), the hush puppies were very crispy on the outside and just right on the inside.  Plus they were round, unlike the tubular-shaped hush puppies I'm used to seeing here in the Carolinas.    To summarize: the service was top notch, and the food... well, not so much.

2	uD3oFKTJnnMCIvyzifwQ	On a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun (or Hell is what it should be called during this time of year), I thought I would get my Greek food fix by visiting Jay's.  Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.  Their servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.  What really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace.
2	dO7OoSNczByltzn28Vsg	There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however, what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich. With this said, the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches....
2	1gvHvsf6YvuUpd9vbf5uRg	I can tell you what is not to love about bootlegger. I have been to many different Italian Restaurants in my lifetime but NEVER EVER have I been to one that gave you a plate of spaghetti with ONE little meatball! That is not Italian. Italians are very generous with their portions and give you either two or three good size meataballs! The guy who sat us needed some lessons in customer service. He had no personality whatsoever! My husband is really outgoing and greets everyone with a smile. This guy that seated us had the most deadpan facial expression I have ever seen in my life. I read some of the reviews and wondered if maybe the ones that gave this restaurant 5 stars were friend or relatives of the owners of this place. I just don't get it. The food was nothing to rave over and the service was just average. I'm sure I will not be returning to this place. If you want a nice place for good Italian food and more than one meatball go to Dean's place or Minutos!
2	wxRufVqLlGXLoUXkbW3OSw	It was okay.  Kinda right there with PF Chang's - nothing great, but nothing horrible.  We had 2 appetizers and some noodles - the papaya salad and the tempura eggplant was nice.  The noodles were a bit greasy and I kept burping aftertaste all evening - but were ok.  It was all OK - but just OK
4	anLO5LKAFTyn9Y1ipkBA	definitely worth it when you get a $5 coupon via email or on your receipt.  not as good as sweet tomatoes but good. i like their tuna snickerdoodle salad which is always on the menu and the make your own strawberry shortcake bar!
2	fniALWjbdeArZ0ZfuuaAsw	I usually go to RIcos' for a breakfast meeting once a week but they were doing some remodeling. The kind people at Rico's spoke with management at Hole-in-the-Wall and set us up for a breakfast meeting there (or so we thought). When we arrived the hostess looked like a deer in the headlights. They were not expecting us and were not ready for 17 hungry people to be there at open. The entire time was an excersize in confusion and disorganization. The waitress kept saying that nobody was told about our party. Funny thing is, I was on my way to the restroom and overheard two employees talking about how they taught my waitress a lesson today...not sure what happened behind the scenes but oh well. I wont be back here to worry about it.
4	NOYGUF5YEQvGpD9atibA	The first time I came to Islands, I wondered why you ordered your burger and fries separately.  Huge portions!  Maybe order 1 basket of fries per 2 people.  Great Burgers, cooked how you like.  Not to pricey either.
2	0vxHmDYH85BPeUzxKO4Tg	You get a lot for your money, but you also get a lot of rice from the store for $5.  And that's basically what the meals are here.    I got a spicy shrimp dish and found very few, tiny shrimp.  It was not spicy at all.  My girlfriend got a chicken dish, which wasn't any better.    This was in my poor apartment-dwelling days, when I rarely threw out much of anything - but I ended up throwing it out.  There was a lot, but it was all bland rice.    It will fill you up for cheap, but so will Niro's or Cocina Real next door, and they have flavor.
4	AuUfebFeCs734vgmz0p9BQ	Panda is consistently good and fresh,  that's why they are always busy! Gourmet Chinese it isn't,  but you can't beat the friendly workers and consistent fresh eats. My new favorite is the honey walnut shrimp. I usually get that for both choice.
4	lopPNettKYFnAKZcUHAoQ	Coup Des Tartes was really a 3.5 experience for me, but I'm going to round up.  My husband and I chose Coup Des Tartes for our anniversary dinner this year for a few reasons - 1. BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right?   First of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entr\u00e9e had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say "intimate" or "cozy"....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere.   The food was solidly good.  There was no "close my eyes and savor" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.     I think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better.
2	vBCxJD3Dh5h4pnnBMsmDKw	I'll start with saying the chicken fajitas were REALLY good. And our food came extremely quick.  However, the service was bad, and my $7 "peach margarita" tasted nothing like peach and EXACTLY like the mix you buy at the local grocery. Also, my friend ordered a virgin strawberry daiquiri and instead she got some weird smoothie with whip cream on top.  Also, while the waitress was fairly nice to us, we waited 10 minutes just for her to bring water and ended up having to ask another server. They seemed really busy, but why someone couldn't even bring water, I don't know. Also, she was horrible to a girl that was at the table next to us. The girl was gluten intolerant and stated this and asked instead for corn tortillas, and the waitress said "WELL THEN, you'll just have to wait." So rude.   Anyway, I will NOT be going here again. If I want chain-restaurant mexican food I will stick with Chili's fajitas.
2	FwC1VC8AZJBF0n1dT4n7A	Ghetto @ROBERTOSINVEGAS right off Twain & Swenson.  Same menu as every location,same food sadly. Myself I like Ground Beef to be like a seasoned maidrite not Shredded Pot Roast with NO flavoring.  TOO Greasy and bland for my tastes!!  I prefer Victors next door
2	nqyYKz2E3BTGAAjHpEAGw	I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under-cooked food was enough to cure me for life - I won't go back.
2	T3OEjCLDisxTMc9eGRqjGQ	I want to start off by saying I can't judge nor comment on anyone elses review, however I will advise anyone thinking of eating at this paticular location to get your food to go.  There are constanly people around this location that look suspicious.   The trash bins and bathrooms were or perhaps still are filled with graffiti.  I had the $0.99 chicken tacos, and they were atrocious. They mask some horrible food with cheap prices. If you go to the location on Durango, the tacos taste fresh and crunchy not stale and flavorless.  My friend ended up getting a carne asada burrito and was on point so maybe the next time I come in the food will be better and the restaurant will look cleaner.  The staff was pretty much on point but that can't compensate for bad food. I speak fluent spanish so communication is not a problem.  Maybe next time Roberto.
2	MHhjMC2vRCkgTV4o7BoYVA	Let's start by saying the food was not that bad...but I'm Peruvian and I was really disappointed because this place is listed as a Peruvian restaurant but there is not a single traditional Peruvian dish in the menu. You can find all kind of Latin dishes (nothing special) but nothing really Peruvian. They are using the microwave to heat up some of the stuff, so that is a big let down. I hope the owner will list this place as"Latin", so no more Peruvians will get disappointed like me.
4	NFxA4gbTc62jd9nr0g4w	I think the food was really, really, really good for the price. The appetizer we got, boiled dumplings, were especially yummy. The General Tso's chicken wasn't the best I've ever had but certainly wasn't bad at all. The egg roll was really good too. My mom picked up the food and she said it was kind of divey inside but that doesn't really matter to me. The food was great and it was quick, and cheap.
2	vcthla7E7hepkxqWQF64g	Based on name alone, this place sounds like a restaurant that also has a bar.  In reality, it's a bar that happens to have food as well.  If you look at it that way, this place is just fine... great if you want a bar, not so great if you want a restaurant.  Although I've only been for lunch, I'm sure this is a fun place for happy hour or hanging out after work/on the weekends.  Like previous reviews have said, it's a dive and frequented by a lot of locals.  It's clean and there are a number of TV's.  It's just not a lunch spot.  It's got that dark bar atmosphere inside, and their sandwiches are nothing to write home about.  To be fair, I have not tried their pizza, which is their showcased menu item.  And their onion rings are fantastic.  If you come for a beer and stick to bar food I think you'll enjoy yourself.  The waitress/bartender who helped me both times I went (not sure if it was the same lady both times) was efficient and pleasant.  I won't be back for lunch, but maybe I'll try out the happy hour some day.
4	kdoczDfM3CEuOzAtHqhvg	There was a time in my life when I was coming here every week with my mom.  I probably still would be if we lived here, but we moved from Peoria in 2005.  (Yeah, I've been going for years and it's always been consistently good.)  But even though it's been a several years since we were regulars, our server Andrew still remembers us and can bring us our drinks before we even order.  They've got the salsa down.  I could eat a bucket of the stuff.  I don't know what makes it so special, but it's my favorite salsa ever.  Perfectly thin, crispy chips that aren't greasy.  And they aren't stingy with refills.  My favorite item (my favorite food, PERIOD) is the Pollo Especial.  Shredded chicken and green chiles fried in a tortilla, then smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar.  Sounds simple, but anytime I've gotten a similar item elsewhere, it doesn't hit the mark.  If you get this at dinner it's a lot of food.  The lunch sized version suits me just fine.  Can't say how their dessert is.  I've always been too full to try.
2	IJi5zLlQYpz5Wforis7w	I have to agree with the review on the watery sweet n sour sauce. Not sure but I've never had it as runny as it is here. Makes me wonder if they water it down. Besides that it is ok but for cheaper, good food go to Chen's (formerly Big Wa) 2 miles away on Mcqueen and Riggs.
4	vFFIGITlAWybv3ToBdB8Q	Obviously, the beer selection here is great.  The waitresses are pretty good at giving suggestions, although can become a bit snobby when you keep ordering more beer.  I guess they just could have come off differently.  The food is okay, the sausages were kind of bleh.  The nachos were really small.  The pretzel was pretty good, I'd recommend that.  Good place to hit up if you have never been.
2	8pf5jwf9WWB8rqx4sqb1g	I like their salsa, chips and prices. They put some sort of strange chemistry-made cheese substance in their burritos that is kind of gross - it tastes like a combo of cream cheese, american cheese and sour cream - everything tastes premade and slapped together - nothing tastes fresh. I have only been here twice, and prefer Chipotle's over this any day of the week!
4	VQM2dldFXCOx10eFEJTxA	Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while.
4	79iA6165CYVUItq7K3DKDQ	Ninos is a great spot. The owner is always hanging around. The staff is friendly and familial. You can tell there are people who've been coming here for years. The pizza and wings are good. Nice thin crust. The ranch and bleu cheese are probably from a bottle, but you don't need it like you do at some places. The price is ok. I am finding that a lot of pizza and wing placed are getting pricier. I'll still be back.
4	x0zKlvX5Cf55PGGXXkSZA	I'm not a video game person.  Just don't play them.  I'm not anti-video game, but I'd rather read a book.  Yes, my geek card membership is nowhere near expiring.  But anyhow...  I still like this place.  See - it was all building up to something.  2 levels of video games - including one that you have to strap yourself into because you physically go up and drop down 4 different levels with your feet hanging.  I even like playing that one!  And one room full of those jet ski/skate boarding/skiing kind of games where you have to move your body to play the game.  And of course, the requisite Dance Dance Revolution.  I'll never play that one EVER - but it's a blast to watch folks play.  The more serious they are the more hilarious it is to me.  I'm telling you - it's free entertainment!  Upstairs is cool.  The restaurant and bar are kinda TGIF/Applebees-esque so while not specifically bad, not amazingly good either.  We rented out a VIP room for a birthday years and years ago and it was an awesome time. Lots of catering options from the restaurant, but the hit of the night was their coffee bar.  All you can drink during the time the room is rented.  I hope they are still doing that one.    And girls, if you aren't into games but you're significant other is - do like me.  This Valentine's day instead of some crappy box of chocolates or flowers that would only die - I gave a Gameworks gift certificate. Oh yea.  Big points.
2	05sioSIEYKU7t0Dj6Gw	One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!
4	PSPGP2yJ91ThoIwQLPe4g	Always fast and have never had an issue with my order. The Brooklyn style is especially good! One tip: always check online for coupon codes. Dominoes has a TON and you can almost always save a few bucks
4	yMCxPilxONrDG0j3JRl8zA	Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.  The three dinning rooms, "outside," inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.  The food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.  The wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.
2	jNLoZZHcuX4Jq6b123uBHw	Went here today with my best friend and thought the place could have been way better. the staff are all young kids which doesn't bother me, but our waiter was a little strange, couldn't remember simple things like what drinks we got, and it wasn't busy so it wasn't like he had to remember many things. The food was good though. But i've been to better Ihops.
2	JdVRbb6mokKGS8bmcdefw	I go to this place a lot for the buffet which is ok. Not really that big of a buffet and if you don't get there when it is fresh you might get some pretty cold food. However this review is about their take-out service. I give them a C- for this experience. They do not give a good portion size to take home and the food was a little bland. I expected more from them. I ordered the pan fried dumpling and the sauce that came with it was very gross it was like they didn't know how to make the proper sauce so they just gave me soy sauce and some spices to go a long with it. It was not good at all. I will probably be going back but only for the buffet would not recommend take out and i will not be doing that again.
2	OWShXJGfC6gJROrkM125g	I'm not quite sure how this place got to have that many stars or how they even stay in business. I'm sorry. I'm not usually one to seem this harsh but I have to be honest. The food sucked! Yes, I know good Mexican food.  We had blah tamales, meduno and chicken tacos. Complete Fail!
2	43HDuoppAVwpVgxmPNDA	I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for the Fiesta Bowl (Go TCU!). Online it looked awesome, in real life, not so much.  The Mondrian is an old hotel that has been converted into a new hip, modern hotel. The main lobby was adorable, as were the pools, but the rooms only looked good from afar. I stayed in a two-bed room and it was soo small. The bathroom door was on rolly tracks that slid open and close, but the door was stuck off the track and there was paint and sawdust around it as if it had just been installed. Not to mention the bedsheets felt like paper.  When we arrived at the hotel, my friend, who is a diabetic, went to the fridge to store his insulin, and found that the fridge was completly stuffed with honor bar things. After a call to the front desk to see if they could clear the fridge to make room for his perishable insulin, we were informed that there would be a charge to the room. Exscuse me? I know it was a big football weekend, but the guests were rowdy and noisy all night, and one of my friends even had to break up a fight outside of our room at 3 in the morning.  I wouldn't stay here again.
2	bBX02M3iFisuv6MPUj8mOA	It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that, as Price's is much better in my opinion.    I was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that.   The mac and cheese was good because, let's be honest, it's cheese and cheese is good.  The collards were authentic and would get them again.    Our server was very nice and attentive.    Overall rating - Just an OK.
4	6RdCazWjA7wpkDbbP5JYdw	Excellent cheap, authentic Mexican.   I have been coming here since 2003.  As a vegetarian I usually get the vegetarian burrito.  A great deal ($4-$5)! I also enjoy the potato and cheese burrito ordered off menu ($3). The chips, quacumole and cheese are made with quality ingredients and I never skip the amazing salsa bar. I decided to be adventurous recently and get the cheese enchilidas with rice and beans. The sauce was tasty but the rest fell short. I'll stick to the burrito.  It helps if you or your dining buddy speak basic spanish. The staff always enjoys my friend's spanglish when attempting to ensure "no carne" is in our food.  As a 24 hour joint, I usually stop by in the wee hours.  However, I had lunch the other day with the same great quality! A relief to know my intoxication was not the sole reason for my love of the place.
2	W7rcaW3s4XuBawxUMGUc6A	We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who, to his credit, was swamped with tables). I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two "managers" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me.   We didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI-TOWN and chose not to take care of us :) haha
2	kYH2JKdzNXJvLOjPSMy2Q	There are not many choices in Miracle Mile so I have ended up here more often than I should. I always go in with high hopes but leave disappointed. Our waitress was very pleasant and service was a reasonable speed. It is just that the food is not very good - especially for the price.  I had the grilled cheese. It comes on Hawaiian sweet bread - which I like - but there was a definite lack of cheese for the thickness of the bread. My husband had the hot dog which he said was "alright". As mentioned in another review, the french fries are good. It is just nothing special.  If you find yourself at Miracle Mile, consider taking a 10-minute walk outside and finding someplace better to eat.
4	sV0xhcavlbXgsptla1ay6w	This is a great place. More of a home town diner atmosphere. The food is always great and so is the service. It has a kind of family atmosphere.   They are only open for breakfast and lunch. 6AM to 2PM (I'm pretty sure)
2	A7VKCrgeGoFUyJOzCVu79w	What has the world done to the people in this place to make them hate life as they do?  And why does that translate to the mediocre food?    You can do better for pizza.  Hell, practically across the street from this place is Salvatore's.  You'll spend a bit more, but it'll be worth it.  This place slaps grease and cheese on cardboard, wraps it cardboard, and hands it to you with a look on their face that plainly says, "I should have listened to my teachers in high school."
4	YsVwB9rwB4PQHzn9fYfQQ	Hash browns are delicious. The egg dishes are filling. Coffee is actually not half bad! This is truly great diner food-- the spot is busy, the food is inexpensive, and service was quick and friendly. We were very pleasantly surprised!
4	drGKpayowRhjLMyv0VyJyQ	Good food, but the menu is getting a little stale, the prices however are rising.  They have recently bumped up their prices on menu items, and it just ruins the value equation of eating here.  I would recommend going on a day when they have specials (you can visit their website, or call in to find out what the specials are).  If you are a chicken person I highly recommend the California Chicken sandwich (I would leave off the mushrooms), and a baked potato.  The break gets a little soggy so you may have to "Fork n Knife" it but its only because the chicken is very juicy!  The baked potato is delicious and comes with a salted skin which goes great with a side of sour cream.  Beer/Alcohol can get pricey here if its not on special, but they do have a good selection.  They have TVs everywhere so we enjoy going when there is a game on, the atmosphere is great on these days.
2	01XMXZgKXjMTRlxIZsSA	I would have to say that 80% of the time I come in to get pizza "the hot-n-ready" philosophy is not true. I have to wait for the pizza and it does get old and that's why I do not come here very often anymore.
2	Jbeb8ZZmD4BIL2M2qBqlIA	I don't expect much from IHOP but this place has the most mediocre food I've ever ordered from it's franchise. I don't know why but I usually try to sway my family from coming here. But it's so close, convenience gets override by reason. I usually prefer IHOP to Denny's but this place. Blah. Their customer service is excellent. No issue with their staff at all, except maybe the cook. There's just not a lot of flavor I suppose.
2	pNRMlSox5VUbN05eECQLJQ	When I think of Italian, I have to admit that I really don't think "Olive Garden".  But our son wanted to go to a movie to meet some friends, and around the Northlake mall, there isn't a huge selection (there is a large selection, but most are chains) so we decided to try the new location and see how it was.  The building is awesome.  It's like a Tuscan villa.  The food is pretty standard fare.  You probably won't be disappointed, and the bill won't be too bad, but it's not going to knock your socks off either.  It left us just feeling so-so.  The baked cheese appetizer was the bet thing we had, and that left quite a bit of time for realizing just how average the rest of the meal was.  Even the desserts weren't that great.  Better to have something good than nothing, but they should finish well instead of starting well, so you're not sitting there thinking about how good the first thing was.
4	jfuuHrlKJlF8rElLYsGgxg	Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.    The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers.   The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.  The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.    You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.  We'll be back!
4	PwiNoopsZOcxbFeWsp7pA	Every employee greets you and goes above and beyond to make sure you are having a great dining experience!!  The food is delicious and fresh.  VERY clean and in a cool location with other eateries & unique shops!!
2	mJsAw5UCH8hmkCaVmrf4eg	I love coming here and seeing the Shiny door that is very well polished and makes me smile. The pride of that door quickly melts away as I order the food.  The sad excuse of a Burger arrives and I decide to Google the food.  Your heart will drop as this food is torn apart and realize that the nutrition is that of sawdust... Well I will still come back for the Icecream. Avoid snacking here at all costs.
2	79E8llj4eKH5urkwiTRGg	I was excited to get to try some authentic Vietnamese Pho - it came quickly, steaming hot, and very large portions! Sadly, I discovered once again that I don't really like all Vietnamese food. I'm sure it's very good for someone who likes it, but I've already known for a while that it's not my cup of tea.
4	aHr78yRkAQ06MTfclzp8A	The pizza at Il Pizzaiolo was fantastic.  We ordered 3 pizzas: the Margherita, the Bianca, and the fennel sausage and rapini pizza (I forget the menu name).  My favorite was the Bianca - the ricotta cheese pushed it over the top.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  We sat in the outdoor seating in the back, which had a perfect combination of sun and shade.  The reason I gave a 4 star rating was for the somewhat slow and inattentive service.  I can't say that the service is typically like this, but we had a waitress in-service who was still learning and IMO, a bit overwhelmed.  But otherwise, I would highly recommend Il Pizzaiolo.
2	mlSN44OlZkTKX4iHocPLw	Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt.  I'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon.
4	SknDWmFYO6gAzPwv5bdmQ	My first trip to the east end food co op was sort of a disappointment,  I guess I heard so much about it that I sort of made it bigger (in my mind) than it was.  First, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.  Nice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things "local" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers.   Great juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.  Great spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas.   Good vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.  That said, the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry.
2	wK8qwQkWuJNEQ6MAMWcZw	This is a horrible restaurant!  I believed the yelp reviews and wanted to try this place...  "Tiki bar"?  The drinks here are over priced and GROSS.  I ordered a bean burrito -  no cheese, wanted some salsa on it.. they put pork all over it!  Seriously?  If i order a burrito with beans only I definitely do not want meat on it!  Also, ordered some chips and salsa... salsa SUCKED, the hot salsa was ok, but the regular one was just tomato sauce, yuck.  No wonder the place was vacant! Never going back here!
2	Ych8ovaOtfZzvlwOaAkoQ	After reading high reviews about this place we came down. The place is nice inside. The owner is asian, nice guy as well but can he master greek food? I asked what they are known for which was the lamb dish so i wanted to try it but they didnt have it available. And the asian guy is the only one here cooking and taking orders. The cheese dish was brought out in flame (looked cool) but when we ate it you can taste the alcohol he used to make the flame, it was gross. The place was dead and quiet so we can hear the guy microwaving the food in the back kitchen. I've tried much better greek food but i give the asian guy 2stars for being the only one there trying really hard.
2	KsgNPxpatBSKaCh8pQBvg	NEVER AGAIN!! Our group of thirteen; two five, one seven, one 11, well behaved! Two star food, 2  1/2  star service. Food $160.71 tax $13.33 = $174.04 AND $29.00 (18%) tip, yikes! = $203.00. If the food and service is 4, 5, star, 18% is cheap. The worst thing, this dump was my idea, every one else wanted to go to Olive Garden. Never got a bad meal there. If you don't see anyone coming through the door, it'll be me.
4	1kMjn0DBTOYUDhdfWQxw	I often drive by this deli on my way to work and never stopped in. Since I was craving a good deli sandwich since last week today was the day. The restaurant itself is nothing special so I was hoping the food was. I gazed at the menu and was disappointed that there was no combo sandwiches, but the guy at the register was helpful and said that I could order a two meat sandwich for a dollar more. So I ordered the pickled beef tongue and chopped chicken liver (sometimes you got try the nasty stuff). He charged me for the lower price of the two and then added the dollar. I thought this was cool of him. Now about the prices, the sandwiches run in the $9-$12 range. I thought this was a bit high , but I wanted to try it anyway. I sat down and my lunch came pretty quickly. From the first bite a strange thing happened, I didn't think of how much the sandwich costs. It was very good. The chopped chicken liver was not dry and the tongue (get it served warm) was tasty. My sandwich came with a side of slaw (very good) and a pickle. Over all I like this place and will be back to try more "normal" sandwiches.
2	YSqXRbqyRJNeXeGIAQJU1g	The Dim Sum is too American. It's not good Dim Sum for real Chinese. There was another Jade Palace in Chandler. The brothers open the store in different places, but the quality is no good any more. It was once my favorite Chinese Restaurant.  Please check out their Kitchen before order foods. See yourself.
4	ri2CXlg83zJ3eGxEZF5b3Q	Fast food breakfast done right here.  Pancakes are actually made to order, with real batter on a real griddle.  No microwave flapjacks here.  Taquitos not bad either, and biscuits are above average too.  Friendly staff to bring out the food.  Teens working the counter seemed a bit goofy though.
2	0Ia3CRYXFJKTwXOrHfGViA	I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.  As I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out.   Decided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita.   I had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.  Won some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat
2	9IxBpPavxhn30XqkZOWQ	Alessia's is the biggest disappointment I have found on Yelp. After seeing all the great reviews, I had been wanting to try this place for some time. With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food, I had high hopes. Unfortunately Alessia's didn't live up to the hype. The service was very slow, which I won't hold against them. Most people were sipping wine, so maybe it's their intention to slow it down a bit. The bread is garbage. Probably the worst part of my night there. It tasted like they went across the street to Basha's and bought some rolls that they heated up in the microwave. A good Italian restaurant has to have good bread. The rest of our meal didn't get much better. The pasta we ordered was disappointing. Small portions, small taste, big cost. Definitely not worth the price we paid or the time we waited. The reviews I read did not describe the food I ate. I understand if you love Alessia's for the atmosphere, the wine or maybe because it's hard to find a place like this in Mesa, but the food I ate did not deserve 4.5 stars. It was bad enough that I have no intention of giving Alessia's a second chance. Not the worst I've ever had, just the most disappointing. One last gripe I have is the service. The bad jokes and cheesy Italian don't fit with everything else this place is trying to do. The guy did know his stuff, but he was slow and made me feel awkward more than I'd expect.
2	sQ1LF4TTGQpnOIvKU3E3sw	Gotta say, I'm not a fan of this place. The prices were very high for the quality of food. Not that the food was bad, but it wasn't great, and for the price it certainly wasn't good enough. The wait staff was nice, and was attentive, but would forget things and made our bill ( true it was a party of 10) a freaking nightmare. 2 waitresses recording their own bill, so two bills with everyone's items on both bills just randomly. Confusing, and a pain. The place it self is nice, but when the food isn't very good and way over priced, and the bar is SUPER over priced what's the point?
2	QPy2qGq9yWtqCVDOKGHyg	I kept hearing how great this place was, so I decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, I found it to be so-so.  We ordered a pepperoni, an Ultimate and a large order of  breadsticks.  I tried the breadsticks first and they tasted great, so I was pretty encouraged about the pizza.  I tried a slice of the Ultimate and it was very bland.  The canned toppings were rubbery and the sauce had no flavor.  The only thing this pizza had going for it was the crust.  The pepperoni pizza was also bland, with its flavorless sauce and minimal pepperonis.
2	jyd6CDh56KRnRd3HOGiAw	Meh.   It's ok.   I come here because I work close by. I usually need a grilled chicken breast of sorts. Maybe some vegetables. It's usually because I am too lazy to prepare a proper lunch.  The thing that sucks about this place is that they usually douse everything in teriyaki sauce which is loaded with sugar, so make sure to get it on the side.  Also, if you just want the protein, you are still stuck having to spend 6-8 bucks on the whole damn bowl. You can't just buy a side of chicken breast. What an inconvenient truth. Al Gore would not approve.  There really isn't anything special about this place. It's grilled chicken, beef or salmon over rice. With teriyaki sauce. Big freaking deal. I'd rather make my own lunch.  NEXT!
2	ad5aGrNlL8dWsyZkvnoFZg	Sadly, the service has slipped. Not enough help to wait on the customers. Wait staff was waiting tables, serving as cashiers and bussing tables. Slow to get drink refills, didn't offer to bring more chips. Food wasn't hot either. The place was a huge disappointment on our visit this week. We are not likely to return.
4	wda3dZDfFWk3lu8rGbV5w	The barbeque itself here is good without being outstanding, but the barbeque sauce is bomb diggity. And those aren't words I kick around lightly, folks. When I say bomb diggity, I mean business.   And this is another one of those places where I feel like the soda fountain is really on point. Try and find a better diet pepsi. Call me crazy, but they know what they're doing over here at the Honey Bear's.
4	mtZHiF33MOXtdgvtvIoTQ	Love this place, been coming here for years and have never been dissapointed. Nothing fancy or wierd just very good chinese food. If you have a craving, and want your basics sesame chicken, sweet & sour chicken, beef & broccoli,egg rolls,chicken & veggies,orange chicken or lemon chicken you will find that here. One of my favorites is sizzling rice chicken, verrry good! They definatley have more than what I am mentioning, but these just happen to be my faves. We bring our kids here all the time and they are very helpful when serving us. For example, they know my 4 yr old loves the egg drop soup with the crispy won tons , but because its so hot they always bring a small bowl of ice on the side to help cool it down. They also know that my 4 yr old knows how to say thank you in chinese and I love how they encourage her to speak more. This will always be a neighborhood favorite , good food, good service and good people!!
4	QJP93i5QPWS4UcrQEQ3L7A	I like this restaurant.  Since it is so small I am a little intimidated to bring my small children though.  The food is good and if you sign up for their online club you get coupons fairly frequently.
2	p30PD30LeAzkK2gflwdZeA	I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that actually charged for the chips and salsa. I guess it would be ok if the chips and salsa were the best chips and salsa I've ever eaten, but the chips did not taste homemade and they were cold. $3 for cold store bought chips and salsa? Come on!  I felt the food was overpriced and it took a long time to come out of the kitchen, despite almost nobody else dining in the restaurant. The menu is small for a Mexican restaurant and the inside dining room is very poorly lit, so it's very difficult to read the menu.   My friend and I both had fajitas (I had steak and she had chicken) and we both enjoyed the food. Not the best fajitas I've ever eaten, but still pretty good.   If they were to drop their prices by 20-30% and stop charging for chips and salsa, then I'd consider going back but until then, I'll fill my craving for Mexican food somewhere else.
4	RNAy7i0R8U70vkzCRI1sw	Got take out from here the other night and I enjoyed it :) I got the chicken breast with Mac and cheese as well as mashed potatoes. It came with a yummy piece of corn bread too.   They have Sriracha by the bottle which every restaurant should have ;)   The price was great and id recommend it to families or anyone just wanting a decent meal, either on the go or sitting down
4	f2flV10UNq2oHYTiRRiLg	When in the Phoenix / Tucson area, this is the place for Mexican Food ('Tex-Mex' for you sticklers). It's a small chain of restaurants that extend to San Diego, CA. I wished they had one in L.A. They have hearty and generous portions and low prices. The food is great, too! The two locations that I've been to are very humble settings, but the staff are friendly and efficient. Very fast service! Just keep in mind that the portions are huge.
4	gp21oPZr2xdl7u7UpAUCA	My office is right down the street from here and it is definitely in my list of go to's for the nearby lunch circuit.   The atmosphere is nice... Definitely a sports bar but I like how the dining area is separated from the bar. Both the bar area and restaurant feed out to the large patio which has mist system for summer and a nice fireplace for the cooler temps. I'm not sure if they use that though cause I've only been there for lunch.   The service is friendly and usually you can get sat and eat pretty fast. Everything I've had on the menu has been pretty good and the people that I've been here with have said the same. They have some specialty items along with the usual sandwiches, burgers, pizza, etc.   I would recommend this place to people looking for a nice sit down lunch spot. I don't know that I would to go hang out to watch a game because I've never been there other than lunch and don't know what the crowd is like or if they are busy.   I know they have some special events also. I think the owner is a pro poker player so they have poker nights and other events that look to be pretty fun time.
4	fOpOBpABErY0XPDvRX7g	It is hard to believe five  Mexican fast food places could exist on 32nd St. & Greenway.  Food City has a place inside, Filiberto's, Los Betos,and here. ( there is one more that I can't think of..) Anyway, I have been going to this place for a few years now.  While the staff is not the friendliest, nor have they been necessarily unfriendly, the food has always been good. Usually hit this place with my cousin for breakfast.  About two weeks ago I had their tripitas burrrito.  I crave that sucker now.  I think I dreamt about it the other night.The tripas are loaded with diced and perfectly crisped tripas( mouth is watering...) If you go, try something a little different.  The "scrap" meats that are common in Mexican family fare are pretty darn tasty.  'Course the "interesting" meat cuts sound a lot fancier when ordered in  French restaurant, but go for a truly tasty lengua, cabeza, or tripitas burrito!
4	UUnTAvzicyoBQeng1aiRow	As far as salad bar buffets go, I find Sweet Tomatoes to be well above average.  My pet peeve at salad bars is wilted or brown-edged greens.  I've eaten at this location many times and the produce has always been fresh-even in the salads that are already prepared.  I also love the soup selection.  There are 6 or 8 to choose from-some staples, some new ones each time.  I've found every soup to be pretty good.  If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes, there is also pasta and pizza, potato bar which includes baked SWEET POTATOES-yum, a variety of breads, and dessert of course.  Sometimes they bring warm cookies to your table.  Table service suffers during busy times, but never too bad.  I think this is a great place to go when it's either too hot to cook, you're not in the mood to cook, or your husband has to eat immediately or he turns into a lunatic without warning.
2	RVUN4CxtkEoyAiS05D8MHQ	Sad sad sad.  As everyone in Charlotte surely knows by now, there are not a lot of dim sum options in the city.  That being said, the two Charlotte dim sum restaurants (Dragon Court, Dim Sum Restaurant) have a history of being  generally decent on average (at least through my narrow Asian eyes), and on their best days they could actually give the illusion that they might fit in as a middle-level dim sum place in Vancouver or LA.  So with the knowledge that Christmas day is a popular dim sum day for Chinese families in Charlotte, you would think Dragon Court would bring its A-game for dim sum lunch right?  Right?  Seriously, Dragon Court, WTF?  THE GOOD  Cheng Fun (rice paper rolls with BBQ pork or shrimp): Perhaps the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed.  The noodle rolls were appropriately soft and silky which is one of the hardest techniques to master, so clearly the badness of the rest of the food couldn't be contributed to lack of skill.  All the rolls had a decent ratio of meat in them as well.  Finally, the cheng fun came out nice and hot, which is more than can be said for several of the other dishes we ate.  Pork Spare Ribs: Done in my favorite style with black bean sauce  Solid amount in each portion, tender and flavorful meat, also came out hot.  That's really about the last good thing we ate.  THE BAD  Dim Sum Temperature: Everything other than the cheng fun and pork spare ribs came out room temperature.  There is ZERO excuse for this crap.  It wasn't like the restaurant was empty and food sat in the carts for a long time.  I'll give a little leeway if food doesn't come out as hot as when it was made, but room temperature is unacceptable.  Textures: The textures of several of the dishes were just all wrong.  What do I mean by this?  Carrot cake (taro, carrot, meat) is supposed to be soft and moist, but it came out way over-dried.  Ha gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) are supposed to have thin dumpling skins but these came out way too thick and chewy.  Baked pork buns should never be burnt on the bottom, which of course happened here.  They even managed to make me not enjoy my egg tart as much as it was clear these were store bought frozen instead of made in-house or bought at a bakery due to the lack of a flaky pastry shell.  Dead Time: As my father says, the number one killer of any dim sum experience is not getting food out in a continuous manner.  It just destroys the flow of the meal.  There was one point where we had finished eating what we ordered in the first go-around of carts in about 10 minutes and nothing else came out of kitchen for an additional 10 minutes after that.  20 minutes to make more dim sum?  Absolutely no pacing of bringing out food?  Come on, Dragon Court, I know you're better than that.  PURGATORY  Atmosphere: The ambience is always in purgatory for places like these.  If you don't mind a big screen TV turned up during all dining hours for the kids to watch, then you will have no problem with this place in terms of atmosphere.  Certainly don't expect traditional Western cuisine service.  OVERALL  This most recent Christmas experience was certainly one-star worthy.  I had never left a Christmas dim sum lunch in Charlotte less than fully satisfied until that meal.  The only reason Dragon Court gets one more star is because I KNOW it can do better than what we got.  I've had better in the very same restaurant.  Consider this review the first two strikes though.
2	gH2IkC1reYK63jrIs3GGg	The staff was so friendly I hate only giving it 2 stars, but... The food was lackluster.  It was freshly cooked, but lacked flavor. The beef tips over rice had no sauce so it was dry. The phili cheese steak was just okay. You could taste more egg than cheese in the macaroni and cheese. On a high note, the onion rings were great. It looks like many reviews were for breakfast, maybe their breakfast is better.
4	lQlCIYKq3hKKnbrDhq7Tg	Hickory River is decorated in "Generic Cowboy Chic", however the food makes up for it.  Fantastic, fantastic barbecue.  Delicious pulled pork, Polish sausage, and beef.  SO GOOD.  If you aren't ashamed at your caloric intake--then you should go ahead and also have a macaroni and cheese side.  DELICIOSO.  I grinned and was emphatically delighted by such a tastylicious meal.  However, it was a bit tempered by the awkward furnishing. :)
4	HEfXkHUsY3WctCpobgxrQ	We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling, and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie, some really kickin' alt rock music, and one of the friendliest crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book.
4	z1u4W2Q8jW9scmn21bcuw	I'm not a fan of most chain pizza delivery spots. Because of that, I typically steer away from pizza delivery because I can't think of a good local spot that delivers in my area. But recently, I couldn't find it in me to leave my house and nothing in my refrigerator looked appealing, so I resorted to the quick and easy call to a pizza parlor. I did a Yelp search and found Chizona's which is practically down the street from me. I can't count the number of times I've driven by this little divey pizza shop and always wondered if it was good. Well, now I'm happy to finally share my report with the yelp world: it's more than good. It's delicious!   The delivery process was pretty seamless. I called and ordered my pizza, paid over the phone and it was delivered to my doorstep in less than the 45 minute time frame they gave me. The delivery guy was clean cut and friendly which is important to me when I open my door up to a delivery person.   So let's now move on to the food. The pizza was better than decent! It's cut into squares, with gooey cheese and nicely cooked bread. It's a couple notches above par but not quite gourmet level. It's pretty much ideal for a fatty pizza night. I ordered a side Cesar salad with it, but I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was more like Cesar salad with a side of salad.   After my experience and the quality of food, I will definitely become a regular of Chizona's and next time I will be sure to visit the restaurant itself and try the Chicago dog!
2	4S24kkkqHwxBruc2sScg	Nothing special and way over-priced.  There was nothing wrong with China Grill but there was nothing right about it either. For the quality of food, I found it quite over-priced. For example, we have a quite small pepper-encrusted ahi plate for $42. The night before we ate at Delmonico and for the exact same price I had three times the fish and more importantly, it was significantly better.  The service was pretty poor at China Grill also. We got there right when in open and despite only have four tables seated and at least three waiters plus busboys, the service was annoyingly slow.
4	59XZ16DgaF37GKX9uP2LmQ	It's Outback!  Can't resist the brown bread.  It's a regular choice for me when I feel like going out to eat.  Overall, the staff is okay, however the last time I went, I had an amazing server named Rob (?) that we only had to ask for ketchup for our cheese fries, which isn't something they normally serve their cheese fries with, so I can't be mad at them.  My boyfriend ordered the Porterhouse, but since it's a first come-first serve and we showed up at about 8:30-9:00, it was very tough.  My boyfriend sent it back and the manager came out to address our concerns.  He just ordered a different steak, and the rest of the night went great.    I know it's a "franchise" and a lot of people don't really rate it very well but I love Outback for what it is.  Definitely prefer it to Applebees or Chili's or something like that.
2	wWQ1Vflg9CbXws7xCKDkw	My husband and I saw that this place had a salad bar, so we decided to try it out. Once we we seated our waiter came and took our drink order, and brought them to us. We sat there for about 5 mins while he was cleaning two other tables, the place was not busy and we had our menus closed just waiting for him to take our order.. Very annoying.  Finally I asked the hostess as she walked by who our waiter was we were ready to order. It was the same guy who took our drink order and taking his time cleaning tables instead of taking care of his customers. He took our orders and I asked for the check and boxes right away as I could tell he would be slow. He told us we could not get boxes cause we got the salad bar, I clarified that we were not using the boxes for the salad, he said those were the rules. Our food came quickly and it was all good, though he never asked. When we were finishing eating he asked if we could please hurry and sign so he could go home. We will never go back. Unfourtunatley the service is always awful in the sun city area.
2	9B71S20xhV9Jrj8ynWiYxg	I originally went through the drive thru, but saw that there were coupon deals if I sownloaded the BK app.  I drove around and came in while I waited for it to finish installing in my phone, and then I had to register on the App... (annoyed, but whatever!)  "Felipe" was kind enough to help my husband and I find a deal for two Whopper meals, which was not in the app.  But after, I paid I realized that he did NOT upsell us anything, ask which sides we wanted, or even offer desserts.  I actually hate that at fast food places, but I know its their job to do, so I still expect it.  We got stale fries, and had to pay seperately for an order of Satisfries because he said that there would have been a difference in price on our other order and since the transaction was completed he could just make the substitution.  Wasn't he supposed to ask us about that before??    I could go on, but my husband is just ready to get out of here, but saved yourself DO NOT try the 4 cheese whopper!!!  Tasted like canned cheese from a ball park snack shack!!
2	hEzP4N6CxTO6EMWCRf9jHA	We went here after watching Guy Fieri's show on the Food Network and came specifically for the stromboli.  When we got there, there was 1 waitress managing the whole restaurant...after waiting about 10 minutes (after being seated), we were given menus and a  different waitress who goes by the nickname "Hot Rod" took our orders.  1 small stromboli and 1 antipasto salad please.  2 waters.  Not that difficult, right?  Not only did she get our order wrong, but she FORGOT TO PUT IT IN.  We waited about 45 minutes and when we asked about our order the other waitress checked on it and said, "I'm SO sorry...we'll get that right out."  Hot Rod walks by 5 minutes later and asks, "Did I take your order?  Where are y'all from?"  I'm thinking...didn't we have this conversation AN HOUR AGO?  We were given saltines and croutons about 50 minutes after being seated...we were so hungry we chomped on packets of saltines to whet our appetites.  How sad is that?  If it weren't for the incompetent wait staff, I'd go back a second time when I'm in Vegas.  The stromboli was delicious (even though she brought out the wrong size) and the salad was nothing to boast about, though the portion was large.
4	ZyrbXa4iNOuJf59D5f01Kw	Stopped by for lunch,,, 1st lunch at this place and i have to say ,, The Teriyaki Shroomer was delicious !!!   A tad greasy at the begining, but awesome flavor,,, def a goto lunch spot ,,,,   Thanks again to the staff there,, !!! great job..
2	hHLb0HGs3pn7G2bars49Sw	Wando's is...alright.  There is usually at least some people there, even on a weeknight, which is good if you happen to have the luxury of making it out on a monday or sunday night.  The drinks aren't spectacular-I don't think the fishbowl is all that spectacular.  The bar itself is pretty nicely laid out-it is three levels with a little bit of a different atmosphere on each level.  The reason why I've never been a big fan of Wando's is the crowd.  The people are extremely uninteresting.  You have your typical 24 year old dudes going out with a group of guys, thinking they are the coolest thing to ever happen to this city/bar, trying to get as hammered as possible-and you've got your 20 year old sorority/sorority-type girls who can't seem to help but falling in love with their every words as well.  You also have the madison grads who come back to relive the days of their youth - who really haven't found anything better to do since.  If I could meet cooler people at this bar, I would definitely like it alot more.  As it is-if you are a madison student, you need to come here when you turn 21 to get the fabled "fishbowl," but after that there are plenty of other better choices in Madison if you want a fun night.
4	HZqOgegsa9W7Z2HDVHE81g	I love the croutons here, it's strange to be obsessed with such a minor part of a salad, but these have the best consistency!  I could tell that they weren't the pre-packaged kind; these are made from bread crumbs in the kitchen.  I can honestly just grab a plate of croutons and ranch dressing and go to town.  That's quite enough info on the croutons, but damn you will understand when you eat them.  The veggie burger here is pretty tasty too, it isn't one of those frozen Morningstar burgers; it is pretty plump and wholesome.  I have always had good service from these lively folks and I need to go back and eat more croutons.  I am salivating right now.
2	qjo0McohtUBhGM0U5sAw	Sure, it looks a little more swank than your usual strip mall takeout place. It's so glossy it shines. But the portions are smaller than other similar restaurants, and the prices are higher. I also find the rice and fried items to be somewhat overcooked and dry. Their service is also slooow. Very, very blah.
4	NZGdsZnoOOYaqzwbUbaA	Why the hate? I see a lot of bad reviews on here and do not understand why. The place is no 5 star eatery by any means. But its good mexican food if in the area, again not great like some old fashion joints make it but it's at least a few steps above Filiberto's. Staff is friendly, place is never too packed. I reccomend the carne asda burrito with cheese sour cream and hot sauce only. Even the bean and cheese burrito is pretty good with a large chicken taco. Give this place a chance but don't go in expecting to be blown away.
4	Kuil7QY6edkIS5LtTrQ7fA	If you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu, you'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are huge, usually amounting to atleast two or three meals for yours truly, so taking that into consideration the prices aren't bad.   Appetizers are all tasty, and their versatility on the rest of menu is really quite impressive. My favorite two things on the menu are the fish tacos and the orange chicken. They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes.   It's very corporate, and the rumor on the grapevine is that although it's pretty good money, working there is no fun.
2	vS4dToAnNqmcI42qaHJ7KQ	I was looking forward to my first visit to Aquavina but came away disappointed.   I'm quite easy to please food wise so this experience was a surprise to me.  This restaurant is relatively pricey so perhaps my expectations were high based on what I perceived would be value for my dollar.  We dined on a surprisingly quiet Friday night. Even so, the service was adequate - nothing more, nothing less.  Not very friendly and welcoming, just adequate.  As for the food.  We started with the blue crab fondue served with french baguette toasts, which was absolutely fabulous.  I'd definitely recommend this dish but don't eat too much or you'll have no room left for the entrees to come.     Entrees were ribeye with roquefort cheese sauce, and my companion ordered the petit filet mignon.  Sides are ordered separately; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin. The portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me.  My ribeye arrived on a big plate with a large portion of roquefort smeared across the top, looking quite lonely without something (anything) to make it look appealing.  Yes, I know the sides are served separately so that limits how the dish might be displayed, but more could have been done to appeal to the eye.    All in all, the food was adequate (except the delicious fondue!).  But I expected a much better experience for the price.  I don't mind spending money to go out and have a delicious meal and lovely experience.  But I do expect just that - a delicious meal and a lovely experience.
4	7rQkS64HLdqorosqOPfNbA	The general manager, Chris Hefner, reached out to me after the Darden Restaurants social media contact made him aware of my review and experience at his restaurant.  I received a personal call and an apology.  On top of that Chris invited me to give the restaurant a second try, compliments of him.  I decided that after writing such a harsh, but accurate, review I should give Longhorn Steakhouse another try.  I went there and it was night and day.  I ordered the same steak again: the Outlaw Ribeye.  This time I was more conservative and went medium rare instead of rare - I love rare steak but un-melted beef fat coats the mouth and isn't toothsome.   It was delicious.  Marbling was great, there was almost no connective tissue, and what little there was happened to be so slight you could eat it without considerable trouble.  The bone was much smaller - and there were very few chunks of fat (as opposed to marbled) on this steak.  I took pictures!  My wife ordered the ribeye.  She thought it was fine but a bit thin, one bite of my Outlaw Ribeye and she was jealous.  After I initially wrote this review I called the manager and he said you can request a thicker steak and you will be accommodated.  For $5 more I can't recommend you go directly to the Outlaw Ribeye - it is thicker and bigger, even though there is a bone there is 18oz vs 11oz.  I have a picture with a fork in front of each of the steaks to try and give you perspective on the relative thickness.  There are some cons to the evening: our appetizer (shrimp and lobster dip) arrived before out complimentary bread (the bread arrived with our entrees).  We were half-done eating it when our salads arrived.  We had just gotten to our salads after finishing off the appetizer (ran out of chips before dip) when our steaks arrived.  I like fast service but our courses came out too close together, but not so close together as to have all three courses out at once.  I ordered the mashed potatoes and asked if I could get those loaded.  I received the standard mashed potatoes, when I got the attention of our waitress she quickly brought out more mashed potatoes on a separate plate and these were loaded.  There is no additional charge to get your mashed potatoes loaded, and we were allowed to keep both sets of mashed potatoes.  Ordering the potatoes this way was the recommendation of our waitress: I always like it when waitstaff know the food on the menu from experience.  These were only minor inconveniences.  The Outlaw Ribeye shined so bright because of its excellent taste and preparation that overall we had a wonderful time.
2	I7bcmddRLek8tjolS9XlA	So my waitress I went there for her great service was no longer at the location. New waitress was good. She got the order right but apparently cooks don't know appetizers should come out sooner than 1 minute before regular food comes out.   The appetizer was so skimpy compared to the visit before.  Food was good otherwise.  Doubt ill be going to this location much more.
4	CEOlplnYYt9cfJYbRq08Q	I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P
2	8uZ9WimPV2UEutKvBCs4qA	so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the "Se hablo espanol" working the mic kept ringing them up as "ketchup/no mustard" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a "caramel apple sundae" the muchacha even repeated it back as "caramel apple sundae" then rang it up as a "hot fudge sundae" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the "new system")
4	nuZZwzpU01IiU9vBXu6UEA	Fat Jack's is a barbecue place. It is known for its barbecue. Last Friday night, I did not go for the barbecue. I went for a fish fry. No, that is not really true. I went for the Cajun Potato soup, but more on that later.  Do not get me wrong about why I was at Fat Jack's. I love all types of barbecue. But this is Wisconsin and it was Friday night. Most of the Wisconsin population will go out for fish on Friday night, not all, but most do. We were with friends and the vote was for fish. Fat Jack's was close and we had not been there for some time. And our friends were never there, so we pulled into Fat Jack's.  We all ordered the Friday Night Fish Fry. One thing I like about their Fish Fry is you can get their steak fries or their beans or Red Rice and Beans as a side. The four of us tried them all and all the sides were all good. The fish was done well with not too much batter, a trait I like in a Fish Fry. Their coleslaw is very good, but I would like more with my fish. Overall, Fat Jack's has a very good Wisconsin Friday Night Fish Fry.  Now really why I was at Fat Jack's and that was for their Cajun Potato soup. It is just marvelous. I could just stop for the soup. It is spicy, but not overbearing. There are chunks of potato and the soup is thick, but not too thick. It has the color of toast that is not too dark. The taste is just great. Order a bowl and you will want more. The Cajun Potato soup is definitely five star.
2	Y4TSnIvAe374edyEO4sdxA	I was soooo excited to hear about a German Restaurant in Arizona. After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food.  While the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back. Unfortunately, only a couple of small portions were close to being spectacular which I am not sure make it worth the time, effort, and money to return again.
2	I7j8wfcUtTymugWRSfGvWw	I usually go for margaritas and it's great. Ate lunch there on Sunday afternoon, and I was VERY surprised. The food was lacking in flavor and spice...rice was soggy and I could taste the flour in the beans.  All the adults were done eating before they brought out the nachos my 4yr old niece ordered. I had bites from my sister's plate and hers was equally as bad. Overall, the food just wasn't good. Sorry Oaxaca.   They do get points for the tortillas and the margaritas.
2	yJNzAPtSJw5zzvwe4gPhAg	After reading some of the reviews here on yelp, we wanted to give this a try. We went here for a lunch buffet on a weekday, had to wait few minutes while the table was made ready. Were somewhat disappointed (probably due to higher expectations). There were hardly any choice in the appetizer selection and very limited options for vegetarian palate. The saving grace was the naan which was continuously served at the table, fresh and warm. The overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing.
4	LRSPbowBxN28IdpLBo7jGA	I agree with some of the other reviewers. The food is great, but seems a bit over priced. Combo plates range between 7-10 bucks! For a corner "dive" with no waiter service, that seems a bit much.   The burros are delish! Something about the quality of the large tortillas they use. For starters, they're authentic. Not big, white, overly floury ones like you buy in the grocery. Folks must love 'em b/c they sell them in a package! The salsa bar is stocked w/ 3 different house made salsas, pico de gallo, and jalapenos w/ marinated carrots and onions. Not all salsas are made alike! I love theirs!   Enjoy!
2	ql1F2oWbjqJ4iw0qYoQVpw	We were recently in Henderson staying at the Green Valley Ranch Resort.  We decided to go to dinner outside of the hotel and did a Yelp search.  We found the Tuscany Grill with 4 STARS!  This restaurant was easy to find. When we walked in the door, we were not greeted. After standing to the side, our presence was finally acknowledged and we were seated quickly.  The decor is a little dated but that doesn't bother us, it is really just about the food!  Our table cloth was dirty and stained they might do well to use the butcher block paper many other italian restaurants use (just a suggestion).  This is authentic Italian.  There were many different pasta dishes to choose from.  After we placed our order, we were brought some fantastic bread followed by a salad drowned in dressing that was not impressive.  The entrees arrived shortly after the salads and they were ok. The food was kind of bland, not enough garlic and nothing out of the ordinary.  It wasn't bad but I have had much better...
2	2p2ltUmOQ4AYEuUq45AbQ	This review will be rather short compared to my others as I have not eaten at Six Penn. In fact, I've only visited once. Once was enough.  My one and only visit was on a Sunday after a super delicious brunch at Meat & Potatoes (dear Meat & Potatoes: I love you. You put almost all other restaurants to shame). I was looking for a different spot for drinks and decided I wanted to check out Six Penn, despite my boyfriend's aversion to the place. I insisted on rooftop seating because damn it, I love rooftop seating. It was hot, but being from Florida I'm used to it. Plus, we got to sit under a neat cabana and there was a great breeze, which kept us fairly comfortable.   Here's where it all went downhill: our server comes by we ordered our drinks. I went with a mojito. I effing love mojitos, one of my favorite summer drinks. I enjoyed them quite a bit in Florida, which makes sense. I was excited to have one here. On a rooftop! I haven't enjoyed this scene in months! I'm all pumped to get my drink ... here comes the server ... I'm taking a sip ... Aah, wtf is this?? They did not just make my mojito with lime sours ... another sip ... yeah, they did.  -_-  P.S. They got two stars for the cool rooftop seating. And because maybe I'll come back and try the food, avoid the mojito.
4	pLnD4svA7jRfhcJkXa8SUA	Overrated, yes. Fun, yes. Something different in a very Midwestern town, yes.  For that reason alone I give it 4 stars.  Take a look at the options while in Middleton, there isn't much.  This is a great place to get drunk and eat a cheeseburger.  That's about it.  However if that is what you want to do, come here.  They have an outdoor patio that is nice in the evening and on days that aren't too humid.  The place is loud and great for families.  The place is not good for an intimate setting, for that go to Lousianne's.  Back to the thing about the drinks, the drink list is enourmous.  They have frozen drinks, on the rocks drinks, beer, liquor, you name they have it.    For those not from the midwest, it is a nice oasis.  I'll leave it at that.
2	LrmfEv9T6ogRJZIDg7AINg	So I had planned on going somewhere else for my birthday, but ended up at the Essen Haus.  I'm only writing about this to warn ye, Yelpers, that they clearly are pretty flaky about reservations so reserve with caution.  One big "woo" to the Essen Haus for taking reservations... even last minute ones.  I arrive with my party of 15, and find 4 angry separate groups of people at the hostess stand.  In total there are three younger women-hostessess who look like they are near tears, and two men-manager-looking types who appear in charge are being gruff and yelling at customers and their co-workers alike.  I finally let them know that I had arrived and we were sat about 40 minutes after our reservation time. (One angry customer had been there for an hour and a half.)   Ugh. Thankfully I appetizer-ed up my guests beforehand.    Our service was lovely and attentive.  I am a fan of the Optimator Beer -- in fact I have had lovely drinking and polka dancing experiences during times previous.  The food was hellishly horrible.  The cod fish fry was stringy, tough, and inedible.   The potato side dish, be it fries, pancakes, or baked, were cold.    The beer and the polka are the only saving graces of this establishment.  Consume both heavily.
4	IEdIbXTqAMdFP8ePHrYV0w	Went for breakfast this morning and I am STILL full!! :-) Plenty of food for the price and they have AWESOME old school candy!  There were a million and 42 people there today and we were seated in good time. The service is always good...even if they refill my coffee just after I got it the way I like it with 16 sugars and 6 creamers!!   Good service will make or break it for me and these folks are on top of their game.   And I only had to kick one little old man outta one of the rocking chairs so I could have a turn! :-)
2	0KLqV6dNwSx7bu6M8xB5QA	Blah, blah, and more blaaaah. I thought there food left much to be desired. I did like the shabby, but cute atmosphere. Our waitress forgot about us and we sat for about 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to go ask for our check.  I got the shrimp fajitas. I always order this at mexican restaurants and it's never so so. It's always really bad or really good -- here, it was really bad. My boyfriend liked his food, but didn't looove it. The salsa was bland, but hot and I've had better chips at chain restaurants. I didn't get to tried the fried ice cream because our waitress kept us waiting too long and we would've been late for a movie. As a side note, True Grit was quite good.
2	6HI3FlCRVDQXSE0B4UAPw	The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink.
4	H6sZkD7ungCECsGpORobw	Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.
4	aQrzMC5zGXhiLOJd9l4xXQ	I am giving the Margarita's 4 stars. The food on the other hand gets 2. A pitcher of marg with a tequila upgrade (Hornitos) cost &28.00. It is the best marg I have found in Phoenix and it is cheap in comparison. The happy hour is great, they have free food that is actually better than entree you might order. The patio is usually full of people having a good time. If you want a marg and a superb outdoor seating arrangement this is your spot. If you want food food with that marg try Los Dos Molino's.
4	j01IrAml7fGI4CORTMqpQ	I actually love the Waterfront Grill. I have never been there during bar hours, so it might not be a good later in the evening, but I usually go around 5-7 for dinner and the food has always been excellent. I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap, but sometimes I go with the fish tacos. Both are excellent and the service is great (because usually my and my friend are the only ones in there - I often wonders how it stays open). The cookie desert is awesome! It is like the Piezooki and Oregano's. Just as good.
4	KmQkQNh3NiJEmTbQeXw6g	If the food weren't so good, this Chipotle would represent my idea of one of the nine circles of Hell.  Enter on the wrong weekday evening during peak dinner hours, and you will feel like you're stuck in the middle of a daycare center.  Little kids run around as if they're in a McDonald's Play Place, but since there is no play area, they're just running around the restaurant.  If you're picking up food at this time, do yourself a huge favor and order it online to-go.  The 27 minute line (I'm not exaggerating; I timed it on my cellphone) is to be expected at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, but the crammed crowd and noise was pretty hard to bare.  Parking is also a regular pain at this shopping center.  I am not a kid hater.  I also understand that these issues are not entirely Chipotle's fault (which is why the place still gets four stars).  It's the parents job to keep their kids in line and it would be a PR nightmare for any company to try to do something about it.  But if you perfer to be in an environment without children running around like it's recess, then you may want to give another location a try.  There's quite a few other Chipotles just a couple of miles away.  The saving grace is my love for Chipotle's food.  It's the one fast-food option my girlfriend and I regularly agree on when we're too lazy to cook and not in the mood to dine out.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  The extra charge for stuff like guacamole is annoying.  But Chipotle delivers great food at a good price, so I'm more than willing to put up with the headaches to get my delicious burrito.
2	la4jkYE00g9cs4YkHoCw	WHERE: Located inside the Fashion Show Mall food court.  WHEN: 10am-9pm, Monday-Saturday I believe, and 10am-8pm on Sundays.  WHAT: My mom and I went to do a little shopping, and decided we were hungry.  We weren't THAT hungry so we chose to share a 2-chicken entree.  Spicy Chicken: This was my mom's choice because she likes adding that spicy zing to her chicken.  It was spicier than I thought it would be, so those who do not like spice, I advise not to choose spicy chicken. Haha.  Lemon Chicken: I absolutely love their lemon chicken. It is just the perfect consistency, the perfect flavor, but not the perfect amount (as in I could have eaten more of it, haha).  I did get to try the samples of Bourbon Chicken they were giving out, which was real good too. From my experience, the food was good, but the customer service, not so.  When we walked up to the stand, the two workers were talking to each other as if we weren't ordering. They'd ask what else we needed, but would continue on with their conversation, which I thought was a bit rude.  So, the 2 stars I gave this place is solely for the food. No bueno!  I hope I get better service the next time I crave their Lemon Chicken =/
4	a2RhQmR6Uchde6cpVzv5GA	This is the place to be! They have great food and excellent service! It has a cozy ambience and their staff is very accommodating and friendly. Their food is very much affordable and it will surely delight your taste buds!
4	HEPZiOFZyIWvS0EKojJxEg	I went to this place for dinner this past week with my family.  I ordered the sausage rigatoni and my wife ordered the seafood angel hair pasta.  We also had the mussels in rustic roma sauce which was amazing!  The experience was great and the service was also very good.  I would be returning as I actually enjoyed this place vs. other Italian places I've been to.  I would recommend it to others.
4	wlP8vRdd18ycj3tM8RUNBg	I love Saba's! They have a great selection for vegetarians and the best tabouli I have ever had.  Their fatoush is great, also but be prepared to wreak for days.  The only thing I wish is that they would bring back their afternoon happy hour.  I loved going in there and ordering about 6 appetizers and sharing with friends. Maybe for the summer???
4	pKx6W2dN6xCFA8ZIesOQ	We ate there several weeks back so the details are a bit thin, but I do recall that the service was good and we enjoyed the burger, club sandwich, and ham and cheese our group had.  Its exactly what you'd expect for a good supper club.
4	dITWtNNQDcIH8Uh20mp5uQ	I'm kind of astonished that this spot has gotten such bad reviews on here! I've had nothing but good experiences at Good Ol' Days. The food is a little pricey for diner-style stuff, and the decor is a little cheesy...but the food is good, and I've always had great service. In fact, I've had memorably great service there. I had a coupon that needed me to spend a certain amount before the server should have honored it, and when I was just shy of the amount, she kindly "overlooked" the technicality (wink wink, nudge nudge).   The plates are huge, too...which compensates for the prices. It's a little more expensive than other Charlotte diners, but the food is consistently better. I've had breakfast things at Good Ol' Days, which has always been big and hearty and yummy, and I've also had their Veggie sandwich a few times. I like it that they give you a choice in sides...so if you're not in the mood to be naughty with fries, you can get fruit or something else.   It's not an earth-shatteringly wonderful dining experience, but I've never had a bad moment there.
2	hY29eE4ItFIvXsAZ8lKgsQ	Wow I am really disappointed. Food was very bland and tasteless. I have three kids and they all ordered from the kids menu. The two "funny face" pancakes were awful. The design on them was pitiful and it was caked with so much whip cream I wasn't sure there was a pancake under it. My daughters Mac and cheese was chewy and gummy. Apparently the drink isn't included with a kids meal so each drink my small children drank was $1.30 a piece! Talk about nickel and diming. I had good memories as a kid but as an adult ihop was a huge let down.
2	fKlKjr2dddrJX42bA0iOw	Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, just regular coffee with cream. I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch.   Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down.
4	9tisgSXhb0q7fI7WlFMlOA	My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!
2	GS0VZWw6nG3dUWdDl91hLg	We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!
2	tynlOVi031WOue5HjHfoQA	You can't put mushrooms on top of the cheese. Your joking right. That the manager said you can't,  well i have done it before. People need to answer the phone much better rather than saying uh uh with every word you speak. Pizza was good, but not how i wanted it. Mushroom on top of the cheese is it too much to ask for?!!!!
4	e5krxSQhfVC6LHJRLLs6g	Havana Cafe has long been a family favorite.  I developed a taste for Cuban food during trips to Florida and Puerto Rico.  Sadly our government will not allow me to visit Cuba.  This is by no means the best Cuban restaurant on the planet but this is Phoenix where there are not a lot of choices.  For appetizers the Tostones are always a hit and the Maduros Fritos are good as well.  The black bean soup is well worth it.  My favorite entrees are Boliche Mechado and Picadillo.  For lunch (or dinner if you are so inclined) the Cuban sandwich, while not the equal of those from the late lamented Chary's Place, are worth the trip.  We prefer the Camelback location, but used to live out in the burbs near the Greenway restaurant and found it fun and convenient, although a little more casual.  The plastic chairs on the indoor patio on Greenway are a little uncomfortable.
2	aimQBiWijTNFoWoTV71Lpw	Roaming the streets, we struck out on the first three places we tried to visit for dinner. Establishments we found on Yelp were all closed for good. A sign caught my eye, with lights shining through the windows, Napoli Pizza! My co-workers go to the one by work all the time and rave about it. This one had to be good too, right?  We walked inside, and started looking at the menu. Deciding on what we wanted, we started to order. The cashier took my order easily, yet when my wife asked what was on her pizza, the lady had to look at the menu, then ask someone else. This may have been because she was new, who knows. We won't knock that too much.  There were a couple staff members just sitting by the counter while their compatriots were busy with customers. There were two tables already eating, as well as a few phone orders that were coming in while we were there. It did not look crazy busy though, just a nice steady flow of business.  We paid, received our drinks, sat down and continued our conversation from earlier.  10-15 minutes later, my pizza came out. Not a strange occurrence,  as between the pizza and little stand, the staff member's hands were quite full.  I was halfway through a large pizza before another staff member came near us, she made the effort for customer service to offhandedly ask how everything was. She was lucky to have asked without fully looking at our table, as the rage in my wife's eyes would have burned a searing memory into the girl's soul, and my wife replied, "know where my pizza is?" or something along those lines. Of course, the immediate answer was, "oh it should be coming out in just a few minutes. This was already a good ten+ minutes since I had my food.  It was almost 45 minutes (total) before they got her pizza out!!!1! They forgot to make one of the two pizzas on our order. As I said, they were steady busy, but busier screwing around (appeared that way anyhow) than making sure orders went out right.  The pizza tasted alright, maybe it would have been better if the bitter taste of rage did not creep into our minds.   We may give another Napoli a chance again, but this one is on our avoid list.
2	BZFkb6KOKRbJGQIX9CcA	Was searching for a new restaurant and decided to try this place out. Not my best decision.   They have a pretty limited menu. I ended up ordering a small Oahu bowl. It's supposed to be chicken breast with their teriyaki sauce. I substituted the rice that it normally comes with for vegetables.   The bowl I got was vegetables with cubed pieces of check on top. Unfortunately, it was absolutely drenched with sauce. Like swimming in sauce. I was even given an extra container container of sauce in case I wanted to put more. Maybe they forgot that there was no rice to absorb some of the sauce, but it was just way too much.   Also, if the sauce was super good, I probably wouldn't have minded, but the sauce was average, at best, and wasn't really unique. I know there's only so many ways to prepare teriyaki sauce, but this felt like it was a recipe pulled off the internet instead of someone's unique creation.   The staff was friendly though (hence the 2 stars), but I doubt I will go back there.
4	Oj0MbZUVf7s11DaPaXX3g	My husband and children love Temari. Danny & Saki (Sushi chefs) really make you feel welcome. It's family owned and full of regulars. The portions are very generous and the prices are great! We have been going for 4 years and tried other places and always end up coming back here. Great neighborhood sushi bar. Minimal seating, can call ahead to check availability. No reservations can be made. Try the Tuna Poke #7, Playboy roll, Spicy Salmon Skin Hand roll. Yum.
2	uKiQRxQAaQRWkq8XyfUrQ	went here with a group from work and it was okay. the kobe sliders could have been better. i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty.  one really bad thing was the beer...the house beer i wanted was not available for what it felt like 30 mins as they were changing the tap. that was silly...i had to settle for another beer.
4	tWlj5MJSRieLjJNQgZD2A	Waffle Fries!!!! Nice rustic log cabin atmosphere and great outdoor porch. My first time here was the Badger/Arizona game last Saturday night and we had a blast with friends.   I'd definitely go back.
4	WiUgFrix5GgwWu2XAhaHkw	Tonight, I had a chance to show a brutha some culture.  When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one. At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs. We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity. Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night. As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one. He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb! As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention. Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!
4	O25pcx3HVBNvdmtHJKFiw	This place rocks. I love my NY style pizza and these guys get it done right over here. There's a reason why this place has outlasted all the other shops that were once on this corner and it's because of good pizza and prices. They also have a good lunch special so check them out sometime.
2	IR0h7N5wYkbA6e0pTUONxQ	Wow, this place seriously reminds me of Chotchkie's from the movie Office Space. I expected to see Jennifer Aniston with her 15 pieces of flair.  The menu is forever long and takes an eternity to read. Every sandwich has some cute little name. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich which was fair at best. The fries were seriously good though. Otherwise, lackluster food... with flair.  Went there on a Monday for lunch on our way home from vacation. This place was pretty busy with local soccer moms, strollers, high chairs, etc. The prices were on the high side for what you get.  I'm sure there are better food alternatives both in the mall and among the out parcels around here. I will not go back.
4	PUIZXpVUsqqNr0g944Gog	Hardee's in Madison is kind of a tradition for my family whenever we drive through town.  We do not have a Hardee's where we live so it is kind of a treat for us.  Simply put, the food is better than Mc Donalds and the deals are comparable.  The service is not quite as quick but your food is fresher when you get it.
2	4sdlb2joE8mHPTpiYNFkQ	Having just returned from London and missing it, we decided to give Tyber Creek Pub a try.  Turns out, it's an Irish pub, but it fully reminded me of the English pubs we ducked into while in London.  As we soon discovered, it was a bit too much like a London pub.  It took us a few tries to realize that there is no real waiter service in London pubs.  You order from the bar and then someone brings your food out to your table, if you're lucky enough to find one.  Tyber Creek wasn't much different.  After waiting a little while, we discovered that we had to order our food from a little window and it was brought out to us.  Like London pubs, the menu was VERY limited and the food was just average, and the place was a little dingy with an obvious bar/musty smell.  If you're in the mood for something extra casual and just feel like standing around drinking, I guess it could be fun.  Me?  After working so much, I like to relax, sit down, and be served some delicious food in a fun and/or relaxing, clean atmosphere.  I can't find all that at Tyber Creek.
4	K4dW72jG3Od7PoRWQ8wdA	Great food and service! They will bring your food to your table if you dine in and the staff is very friendly especially the manager.  Be sure to try the half chicken meal and Mac and sweet potatoes.  Their buy one and get the second half off is an amazing deal.
4	v4jw2p9EdIIU5EyNUR7eJA	China Inn seems to have improved since I last reviewed. We used Grub Hub to order, which is a pretty good bet if you want it fast without getting hung up on.   They have also expanded their menu--sesame tofu, General Tso's tofu, etc. We ordered the Bean Curd with garlic and it was fresh and flavorful, lots of fresh veggies. It was not hot as advertised, but more subtly sweet.    I am pretty pleased with their progress. They even offer edamame and I hope to try the cold sesame noodles soon.
2	cRfMD4RON6GKZdkpqYm4nA	I'm not sure exactly where out DQ's are out here in the Bay.  But it was a late night, and it was hot, I've already eaten dinner, wanted something sweet.  I'm not a real dessert fan...I'd rather eat FOOD. I was gonna get a blizzard or something, but opted for a cherry 'rush' think slushie....something wasn't quite right....wasn't icey enough for me, maybe because they cut the machine off, considering they were closing in 10min. but so what....  but it sure wasn't nothing that my Effen black cherry vodka couldn't fix!!!! a good nite it was :)
2	i3zApRiaFFzbllaDZjEAsA	Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.  Pizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.
4	IpppdRmjD9HbA1TZflNQ	My NYE resolution was to stay away from fried foods. I tried, I really tried. That was until someone popped the question "What do you want from Sonic?"  It was a co-winkie-dink or maybe a sign from fate because I was looking at a Sonic coupon flyer (the ones you receive in the mail) and I was wondering what the burrito with the Frito's tasted like. Sign or no sign I was going to stick to my resolution. I responded, "Nothing, but thank you for asking."  As Fate would have it, I received my utmost fave fried junk food in the WWW! A corndog. I scarfed that puppy down, chewed on the crunchy batter that is stuck to the stick in no time flat.  I *heart* Sonic's corn dogs!  PS - 2pm - 4pm it's happy hour! Drinks half off! Woo Hoo for the Cherry Lime-aide.  4 stars because they have great customer service!
2	MvM7jDxfMVFuPSdijjHCg	Not really impressed with this place. Food isn't anything to write home about or to rave to out of town visitors about. I would say you are better off going to Los Gringos Locos in AJ if you are trying to eat in this area.
4	187Anj5LReLVrKfKCnBo9Q	This dominos is hit or miss--usually hit.  The deals are usually good, delivery is usually quick and the people are usually very friendly.  A few times, I've had the driver get lost on the way to my condo (which is pretty easy to find) and been really bad at listening to my directions as I try to help them over the phone.  Other than a few issues with delivery people my experiences have been pretty good.  Prices are good!
2	44AACsoW27UWKSvsFkkujA	Going out on a birthday date, I wanted to give my date a good first time sushi eating experience. Though was left pretty dispointed and a somewhat hefty bill that was beyond what the food was worth. Because this was on a Monday night, it hardly had more than 7 people inside so parking was a breeze.  Inside the layout is pretty akward, and the high tables dont make it easy to be close to your date, the wide tvs were a nice touch and a huge selection at the bar. Though the atmosphere was far from welcoming, we ordered the calimari for the appetizer and two rolls (shrimp and the dragon) The calimari was very small in portion but i didnt mind cause it was extremely tough and bland. Our order sat on the counter for 20 minutes before the waitress finally took the time to stop gossiping with another co worker. The rolls were again bland. My date and I eventually decided to just leave and order from the nearby panada express which sadly was FAR better and cheap.
2	BE3CFI3cFbuZdp7hEP48OQ	Not a great Subway. It almost never has another customer, for reasons that are pretty clear. The staff is sullen and disinterested. They skimp on the ingredients (especially the vegetables -- ask for more to get the stink eye). Keep on going to the Subway on University and Country Club for a better experience.
2	dRzjMXrl4V4Crt7fz5A	Myself, my husband and our son went on a Thursday nite and we were one of three tables there (at 7:00p) and it is as stale and boring as last time we went (years ago.) They got the steak and I got a sandwich (nothing else even sounded good).  My husband liked the green chili Mac n cheese the most and the toasted bread of my club sandwich was so dry it cut not only my palate but my mouth as well.  I could not eat it!  Steaks were smaller than before and the sides were just ok.  My onion rings were over fried, dry and tasteless. My husbands first beer on draft was Bud and $1.50 and the re-fill(?) was billed as a Coors and $2.50?? He swears it was a Bud!! Probably will never go again since there are many better choices to eat in that area. I did like their raspberry tea though.
4	ZW6yW2PUObRjfhKzLhQaRQ	The food at IHOP is always good, but the large variety of menu options makes this a great place to go with large groups of people. It's a popular place, so expect a small wait on Saturday mornings. But the atmosphere, despite the large amounts of people during the busy times, is that of a friendly neighborhood. :)
4	8Et06TB6qU40WGc3OQr2Q	Cozy place with good fried food and super cheap booze.  I expected some attitude from the locals when stopping in here before a party nearby and got none--partly because we were the only folks there but also the bartender was nice as could be.  Perhaps some day I'll go back and point out the inconsistent apostrophe position in their signage and get punched in the face.
4	9eW7hkZqujeKmrXgQAhWHQ	Uhm, can you say hot pastrami and sauerkraut sandwich?  Nice.  This place has a pretty good selection of sandwiches, and they all looked good (it definitely took me a long time to figure out what I wanted).  It's a few bucks more than Sticklers, but for all the extra choices, I'd say it's worth it -- another good place for lunch if you work downtown and all you ever eat are sandwiches.
2	9qolIuInF0CiC7GrAsOhlA	Wait staff is nice and atmosphere is great but the food was not as good as everyone raves about.  We went with very large party  of 14 people who all ordered something different.  No one was raving about their food.  Yes, they do serve large portions and if you split with someone they get you with a split charge and they don't even split the meal for you.  I had my 94 year old grandmother with me as well as 2 children and they would not give her a childs meal.  One of the kids ordered off of the adult menu too.  Breakfast is the cheapest meal to prepare but this place charges $12-$18 for breakfast.  I have to say I will not return to this place again.
2	NxF3jJFjjSxdYOiGJ9avww	went here yesterday for a late breakfast-at-lunch-time, first time and as always based on previous reviews ... so here is my two cents. I was glad there was no wait, which actually surprised me. Clean, cute country decor. I liked the water pitchers on every table. The lemon inside was a nice touch, but have to say that to a ice-water-and-lemon-freak to me, there was too little ice and too little lemon. But I don't like overwhelming people with special requests so I didn't say anything. Although I'm sure it wouldn't have been a problem - everyone was very friendly. The menu was fun to read with lots of options.  Notably, side item substitutions are easy and standard. Ok, on to the food. My husband had an 3 egg omelet, which while it was good, was smaller than we expected and have had elsewhere. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with turkey, which was also just ok - not great. The smoked turkey was incredibly over-salty - I left it on the side. What was wonderful were the pancakes, which gave my ratings the two stars. Unlike anywhere else I've been, you can specify if you want the extra ingredients mixed in or just on top. I did ask without knowing and it paid off! They were truly scrumptious, light, fluffy and delicious. Next time I go, it might be alone but for those pancakes it would be worth it! Also, they offer a card which you can get stamps on with purchase of an entree and some days are double stamps. After 6 stamps you get a free entree. This is awesome! I will be back soon.
2	UKsvGPIo1VnfYjwt5KTDg	Shame on me for going to a chain Italian joint, but we were in the area and soup salad and breadsticks sounded good.  I have not been to an Olive Garden for maybe 7 or so years, and WOW have they gone downhill.    Food is ok, not good.   Service was poor at best.  Waited for drinks, waited for food, waited for check much much longer than we should have.    Learned my lesson and will not be going back (to this location anyway.)
4	JoxY6P2uBcFA3DikRLnWw	A good Subway.  The service here is fantastic, and don't let the long lines deter you.  The lines move quickly.  Tastes like any other Subway (and I've been to a bunch).  You can get in and out quickly at any time of the day.  I go here often for lunch, and have never had a bad experience.
2	VRBAR7a9j0dQK105soi4Rw	The food was tasty, for sure.  The seating was comfortable.  The service, however, left a lot to be desired.  Our waiter, who I believe was the owner, was far to overbearing and was borderline offensive.  Maybe I offended him by asking for hummus, but surely he's used to us dumb Americans not knowing the difference between Greek and Mediterranean.  Anyway, he proceeded to make a comparison of the word "hummus" to the word "homos" in an explanation of why he didn't serve it.  And then he said "homos - okay, that's a little greek," and shrugged.  Whether it was a light hearted joke or a slam doesn't matter to me, because he doesn't know me well enough to joke with me like that.  He made us uncomfortable from his first greeting and we won't be going back.
2	W9YDTxs9bx3fHkqz43fo4w	I needed a quick bite before a meeting and settled here by default. At first I thought the long line was trouble, but it moved along quickly as the staff knows what they're doing with the lunch crowd. Once I got my food, though, any relief went out the window. I know it's a simple sandwich/salad lunch spot but man, this was bad. I couldn't even finish my chicken "gumbo." That's saying something for me. I love gumbo. The turkey sandwich filled me up, at least.
4	pSKJ6ii0pjGXZGmhPbS5w	On the surface Big Bowl is your typical family owned local Chinese place but it's my favorite. You'll find the standard fast-Chinese-food fare on the menu, plus a lot of extras. Their Boba Tea is great, and they offer ramen and tofu choices as well. The portions are big and the service is super friendly. If you can, save yourself time and go in to order, rather than relying on delivery. They're quick either way, but the owners are so happy to see you, it makes your meal taste so much better!  Compared to other local places like House of Egg Roll, Big Bowl has bigger portions, comparable prices, and lots of extras.
4	2mCBp1e0Abw9jtbnHMbgDQ	Soho Bistro is great Chinese food at a great price. I used to get take-out from here every couple of weeks when I worked uptown. I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!  My favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.  It can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.  Another great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.  The prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho.
4	FaxcMoLlZ1pevKyWaQLRQ	The Valley of the Sun has it's prevalance of *Bertos taco joints--Filebertos, Humbertos, Rolibertos, etc. Way out in FH, the open late (til 3 am on weekends) and thought it's slipped over the years, there is no better deal in FH. Generally good to go with the Shrimp Burrito (even better enchilada style if you can handle that). Most of the rest of the menu is good, thought I was disappointed to find ham rather than chorizo  on a breakfast burrito.
2	RaglVa1UxfZP53qTkMlqQ	I ate here for lunch today...am I missing something from all the rave reviews...  I had the Chicken Lo Mein, the quality of the chicken and lo mein noodles is cheap, the hot & sour soup was okay but nothing grand, fried rice was plain, and the egg rolls weren't spectacular.  My dining companions had general's chicken, and mongolian beef...and they didn't seem to like their meal ither.  Over all it was a 1 star, but the 2nd star for the price and the soup.
4	KMZyG4SGqm3BNr9xTwk5w	Great sports bar feel.  Lots of TVs.  If you are looking for a menu of perfect bar food, this is the place.  From Burgers to Pizza and chicken fingers.  And all the fried appetizer favorites.  With the great sports bar feel on one side, they have a family friendly dining room also.  The owners are hands on and greet everyone.  And if watching the game gets boring, they offer off-track betting.
2	ACJ5OP9u4VnYk9UVFGg7A	Bought 2 tacos,1 soft 1 hard. It was Ok, The price is right thats for sure. $1.06 for two tacos. its kinda like taco bell but the meat seems a little more suspicious.i wouldn't come back here unless i was broke and hungry or very intoxicated. taco bell is a better choice
2	lRH2P7rPMYZuon3usN7kQ	This location was one of the worst experiences I've had at McDonalds in a while. The location is older and you can tell the lot needs to be repaved. The drive thru was extremely slow. Add to it that the location is really inconvenient, and this made for a poor experience
2	gRCte6rFEymEZ2koGFUuQ	I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.  The staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again.
2	oYANxEF4XEvP1BnkGjFcQ	REDO!  I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.    My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.    My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.  So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:  Coca Cola Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice  Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.  My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.  Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.    I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.
2	rIHFsRdlWrqpPVIPD7jVog	Maybe I am missing what the big draw to Joe's is but I feel like C-U and Campustown have better bars around town. Being a grad student, I think the appeal is usually lost. The only plus is that they have my favorite cider (Strongbow) on tap. The service is okay and I am glad that they at least have their own beer. Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's.
4	ht12fkeaG0hGYsD8Cl4VYg	This was the first time I actually ate at McAlisters and I'm not sure why because I really enjoyed it. I got the pick two with half the Savannah Chopped Salad & half the Spud Max.. Both were delicious and together very filling. The salad was fresh, crisp, & flavorful and the potato was hot, cooked prefect, & loaded. It's a great luck spot & I will be back to try some other things on the menu. The cashier was very friendly & offered me suggests one being the salad I ordered. The manager named Angel was in the front greeting customers as she was helping her staff & answering calls. It's always great seeing a productive and helpful manager. The ladies in the lobby were very friendly while cleaning the tables, asking if we would like refills, and taking up our trays. Overall this is a great clean location with a great staff.
2	ypKuno0j5yDzI9wFksqWA	Had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in Tempe. It just wasn't anything to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor in the Kung Po Shrimp (though the shrimp itself was pretty good), and the Hunan beef left a weird filmy taste on my tongue. No dish was less than $10 either- not worth it at all. It definitely didn't make me want to go back for the dine-in experience.
2	3Dhgedy2phXRDsoxBaqZw	Not bad... better than panda but not by much. Their "fried" rice that comes with the lunch special is hardly fried. Tastes like they poured soy sauce over white rice stirred it and called it good. The bbq pork chow mein wasn't horrible.
4	b90RoWypptEogVBzttueKg	Best option for Indian food in the Valley...had the Biryani which was delicious, and came with a ton of meat for a decent price...not to mention some excellent sauces. I hear the buffet is the way-to-go, but have yet to try it.
2	aPmCXArt34jFSIHLvq3OXA	Went here for restaurant week last year and definitely will not return.  Our waiter was snobby and seemed like he didn't want to wait on us but only did so because he had to. We got the prime rib sandwich and it just did not live up to our expectations in any way. The meat was better on its own and was tough and hard to eat. I won't be recommending this place as I feel it is overpriced and overrated for the quality of food and service.
2	34KPaYEtd8cJ5Xd9ihiXA	While my friend Rand H. enjoyed his meal here, I was not impressed.  There are no Filibertos in Northern California.  When I moved to Arizona and saw them all over I thought I might want to try them.  Almost everyone I know said "noooooo, don't do it!".  But I did not listen.  And I do like to think for myself.  Not everyone has the same taste so I gave it go. The taco shell was a bit stale, the meat tasted over cooked and greasy.  There was only one good thing about the burrito, the tortilla was fresh.  Overall I doubt I will go back but at least I can say I tried it.
4	j2I7Iia6Jn9ycBRz4HT0og	I just want to mention that we came back on a Sunday afternoon at around 8:30.  We ordered burgers and cheese curds.  They tasted a lot like burgers and cheese curds.  I also don't think the prices are that great on further reflection.  6 dollars for a stinkin cheeseburger?  That's not great...  3 dollars for a pabst?    But the place was kid free this time.  That's nice.    I would give higher ratings, but some drunk regular yelled at us for ordering from the menu instead of the "board."  Unpleasant.
2	GTOKKUspNdeVsLFW9wBng	I went in with very low expectations.  Knowing the other reviews, one would ask why I decided to come to Tom's Diner.  The answer, they have hot roast beef sandwiches and my friend really wanted a good one badly.  Not a lot of people order this entree so there was the possibility that it would be good.  That being said, we entered into the contrived, 1950's ambiance and made our way to one of the booths on the side metal wall.  It did take a bit for our waitress to finally notice us, but she brought the menus as soon as she stopped talking to the other servers and cooks in the rear.  We ordered our cokes and as she left to get the drinks we looked over the menus, intent on having our order ready by the time she came back with our drinks.  When she arrived we placed our order for the following:  Italian Wedding Soup Hot roast beef with fries Buffalo Chicken strips {hot} Large gyro with no lettuce and sauce on the side.  The last two items were both entrees and I ordered both for myself since I figured one of them would be good and one of them might not be so good.  I love both gyros and buffalo chicken strips and I tend to be very forgiving of issues in their preparation because of how much I love them.    The service so far had been very slow.  The arrival of the soup did nothing to reverse my thought on this issue.  The Italian Wedding Soup was not the worst I had ever tried, but it definitely wasn't the best.  It lacked flavor that you expect in an Italian Wedding -- one could get the same flavor from a packet of chicken broth.  My chicken strips arrived to the table and I immediately went for them.    The strips smelled good and looked good -- not too wet, not too dry.  I tried some of the blue cheese -- not so good, I would stay away from this dressing.  I took a bit of a chicken strip and it wasn't bad; it was made from dry, white meat and it wasn't hot.  Maybe Pittsburgh hot, but it was between mild and medium (closer to mild) at best for the rest for me -- remember, it takes a serrano pepper for me to feel a tingle. I wasn't displeased with the strips, but I had definitely had better.    The gyro and the hot roast beef sandwich arrived.  I was happy to have what appeared to be some good looking food.  The issue is that all of the food had looked good so far, while the actual flavor had been underwhelming.  As is my norm, I tried the separate parts first to see what kind of flavor each had.  Trying the gyro sauce, I can honestly say that it wasn't traditional.  The sauce was just ranch.  I really don't care for ranch.  I tried some of the meat and the pita; the meat was under-seasoned and the pita was hard on the outside and chewy on the inside (not good chewy, either).    I moved on to the open-faced roast beef sandwich.  It didn't taste bad, but like the wedding soup it also didn't taste good.  I went back to my gyro and finished it with ranch strategically placed.  Throughout the entire ordeal of tasting the food, my cup went dry.  And it stayed dry -- for a long time.  I eventually had to ask one of the other servers in the restaurant since my server was ignoring my flailing arms in the rear of the restaurant.    As bad as the gyro was, I can honestly say it wasn't the worst that I had ever tried -- Stoupsy's in Miami holds that special place in my heart.  Overall it was a lackluster experience that I really don't want to repeat.  I might return if someone really wants to go.  If I do go back, I would just get the buffalo chicken strips appetizer.
4	VzAJ4wNuMIEWAohCY1HDw	One of my oldest and dearest friends is in town visiting his family and called me at 2:30am asking if I wanted to meet up for a cup of coffee & conversation. I suggested this Waffle House. As always, the coffee was hot, delicious & fresh. We shared a breakfast wrap, eggs and waffles. Server was awesome and the food arrived quickly -- food was yuumilious. I can always count on Waffle House to be there for me when I'm in need of comfort foods and sharing times with good friends. Thanks, Waffle House!
4	yKtXcu3ZGvEJVPLQYyivDw	I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, but I am now a fan. There is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count.   The place looked nice. It was clean and really cool looking. The food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly. I will be going back to try their pizza and other food.   We had a burger, which was really good, and we had the lobster slider. French fries were good to.
4	OZR2QREDq2XwjtD1eVIzNA	I enjoy going here although it is far from authentic Mexican cuisine. You gotta get the mushroom brown sauce it's killer. I enjoy combo number eight with the brown sauce added. Stay away from all of the chicken dishes they are bland and dry.
2	vnTb01RGKgcnjoFKcI3Crw	Like most Robertos this place was very dirty, and they tried to rip me off $10 in change. The food is quick and reasonable, which is why it gets two whole stars. But the food is half rate and its not an amazing atmosphere. Let's just say you should wait until your drunk to visit this place!
2	OqSKJsdf5rGFK8leIKeb5w	Was here last night, dont know if its just me but usually when you walk into a sushi/thai place you get a welcome from some one in a corner or from behind the sushi bar, but not here. No one came to seat us and there was no sign so we just grabbed a seat. Everything else like server etc was ok. In regards to the food itself, we didnt like it at all..Thai foods known for its authentic flavor and spices.. This place want good. Honestly theirs better tasting thai food in Vegas....
4	ZT2FZqK4H9hIQR81xvEw	This place is only good for it's beer. Their food is unimaginative and boring. Their hand crafted beer is where it's at.   Brian Helton, their brewmaster, knows his stuff. He has some beer medals to prove it. The Roadrunner Porter, Raptor Red and Stout are some of the best beers of their style out there. Brian's seasonal brews are top notch as well.  The wait staff is wish-washy on service. Bad nights are common, with slow service.  I was a regular there for 4 years, so I had semi special treatment.  Also, if you are in the service industry, this is the place for you. After 10pm, show your paystub or food handlers card, and get $2.25 pints.   All in all, Great place to throw back some pints, and grab a snack. I wouldn't go there for just dinner.
4	cvzcNTEtcf3097GkUVoqg	I gotta say, it was decent. The atmosphere was reminiscent of my childhood hangouts. The pizza was descent.  You may be thinking, "Descent? Fours stars for 'decent'?"  Well, let me explain.   17 years ago, I was ripped from the pizza haven that was my first home (after the womb, but just as comfortable), Long Island, NY. The reasons are unclear to me still. I was a vulnerable nine year old uprooted and moved to the cruel and often cold (metaphorically, not literally) Sonoran Desert, I had no way to cope with my new surroundings. Oreos just did not fill the void in my empty pit of a stomach, which I was quickly trying to fill with something familiar.  That something familiar was a good, thin and crunchy crust, extra sauce, light on the cheese, pie. Pizza pie.  No one could provide for me. I was desolate. Pizza places came and went. A sauce here, a sauce there.   Eventually I learned to cope on my own without the crutch that was the perfect slice. I live for my semi annual trips back to the pizza- womb that is Greenwich Village, but when I am feeling just a little nostalgic, just a little emotional... a slice from Buono's will suffice.   And that is why I give 4 stars.
4	89B3CA5ptaIVGG6JMHfGtA	I made the mistake of stopping by  on and ordering a pizza there.  It took like 30 minutes(which is to be expected).  I ordered a Sausage and Pepperoni pizza  That being said, I was generally impressed by the pizza I got  I'm probably going to go back a second time
4	vRBgcuhd4LgYfsx4UtOJQ	Yeah, it's kind of a dive bar.  Fun environment, lots of tvs, decent eats, good drink prices and a jukebox or live music depending on the night.  Who says you can't love a dive bar?  I do.  If I still lived in Tukee I'd likely be there WAY too often.
4	AKXiLhSdgZgYKIm2X8Mrgg	I've lived near this Jack in the Box for about 4 years now and I will have to say that the employees here are the most courteous employees I have met.  In this amount if time I have only had maybe 2 or 3 times were they have messed up my order and even then they were very eager to help rectify the problem.
2	RRbMLFu3Kpxfk16iitT72Q	Not sure if I came on the wrong day, but my experience wasn't as pleasant compared to the other reviewers. I'll make this quick and painless. My pancakes came out cold. I sent them back, and received a fresh stack. There was a shortage on coffee, so my sister had to wait for more to be brewed. I ordered ice coffee, but couldn't get a refill because they ran out. The server was friendly, but overwhelmed. The taste of the food was on par with all other Ihops that I have dined.
4	d15pGrnYKkpSd8wYSDYHw	I had lunch at Monterrey on a Saturday.  The place wasn't too busy and I was seated right away.  The salsa and chips appeared quickly.  They also had a second dip, which was ranch, mayo and seasonings.  It was different and good.  I ordered the mole poblano which came with beans and rice.  My food came out in a reasonable amount of time and there was a lot of it.  The chicken grilled and was very tender with a nice smokey flavor.  The rice and beans were pretty standard.  I haven't had mole much, but this was pretty good.  It complimented the grilled chicken well.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend Monterrey to others and will be back myself.
2	DEAAvA0Sxd3cxvKHlP5w1Q	Went here for lunch and opened the place up at 11AM. It is a very casual spot, with very decent prices. Started off with the traditional chips and salsa. Chips were ordinary and the salsa was a bit watery for my taste. I had the Gollo burro. Very good. I don't know of too many places that serve this style, but I'm into it. The restaurant is located in the corner of a strip mall next to a fry's supermarket and behind the Jack-in-the-box. Inside, it's actually surprisingly spacious, and we had plenty of room in the booths. I'd go back, but there are way too many spots I have ranked higher that it may be a while. Decent, but not outstanding. Maybe I'm picky...
2	2pO81Z3rVbsCvnJcq4VVnw	This is the closest Pizza Hut to where I live. We've ordered here a few times. One time everything was perfect. The second time, our breadsticks were not the ones we ordered and paid extra for. We called and got a credit for a future order. The third time, the pizza was lukewarm and we didn't bother to call the store. The last time we ordered, our pizza was 10 minutes late, lukewarm (at best) and the breadsticks were not right. Keep in mind, I live about 1 mile away. I called the store and they gave a full credit, however there shouldn't be this many mistakes time and time again.
2	MTmldfPUjGEbqTP7549Q	Aw man, this place is all under new management and stuff.  The actual space looks way better since they remodeled, but the menu has jumped in price, but fallen in quality and quantity, and for some reason, the dirty chai was not as good as I remember it being.  Also, they stopped making their own muffins.  Now they have those huge, come-in-a-pack-of-25 ones from Costco, and overcharge for them.
2	w7Mi87XYouqWMt9CCTATA	This place makes no sense.....you walk in and there are servers, but there is also pick up window, also a register where you can order food. Do I sit down or order at the counter? I ordered at the counter, $10.00 for a bagel sandwich and fries seemed a bit high price. There are no lunch specials or combos. I ordered the roast beef on a jalape\u00f1o bagel ( They call this a jalape\u00f1o bagel.... Are you kidding me?) food was meh. There is also a bar in back where you can order drinks. At a bagel shop? This place is just going in way too many directions for me.  I don't recommend this place at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of one simply cause the food wasn't all that bad.
2	q1mF4x4WlfPzhD6P8CCmA	Meh. This place doesn't suck, but it's not very good. The only time you should really go is if it's your birthday so you can have free beer.  Their menu is incredibly boring and extremely overpriced for the quality of ingredients that they use. On my most recent visit, our table got an order of Nachos to share. With chicken, it cost $12.50. It was nothing more than a plate of tortilla chips covered in Day-Glo orange cheese, jalapeno slices, and gray (eww) dried out chicken pieces. I also had a burger as my entree, and the beef tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a microwave--almost metallic. My dining partner had a salad that she seemed to enjoy, but it's hard to mess up a simple green salad. Sadly, I've been here more often than I'd like to admit because they host Team Trivia on Tuesday nights. My boyfriend and I decided to start going somewhere else for trivia when we recently won and got a $40 gift certificate and weren't excited to use it because it meant we'd have to try to consume more of their crappy food. We spent it mostly on booze instead.
2	9qQPmFeuJT1soYu4Cg	Ok, where to begin. The windows were filthy, you could not see out them. The service was ok until the point we ordered a burger for my daughter, medium rare. Now, we know exactly what beef temps are I was a prior chef. It comes out rare almost raw and the waiter has the balls to say just so you are aware next time you order a burger out, this is medium rare and not medium. My wife was livid and looked at me I looked at her smiled and let it go. He then proceeds to tell us they ran out of roast beef but they have pot roast they can use. I had to asked several times for my drink to be refilled. This was by far the worst place we have eaten in Phoenix on our vacation, it was not by our choice, family was meeting there and I did check out yelp prior to. The men's bathroom had a urinal from high school with pee all over the floor, smelled, I mean keep the bathroom clean at least.....never again..
2	BHjAorGpZERValqFCL5dw	I was very hopeful when I first tried this place. Upon entry, I noticed that this place is not very hygienic. OK, so let's try the food. I ordered crispy calamari and I got a burnt squid! You can actually smell the burnt food when they put the plate on the table. Their orange chicken is sooo sweet like they marinated in sugar and cooked in sugar and orange juice. The barbeque chicken is dry. The only good food in our order was the fried fish but then it is the most expensive in the menu so it better be good. The serving portions are ok. I will not go back here again.
4	I1SGjQQgBnfv1QblwCYSQ	Jordan's is the first restaurant I ever ate at- I was only 4 months old and I had rice.  Ever since then, this restaurant has been my guilty pleasure.  My favorite thing on the menu is the sour cream cheese enchiladas- they are heavenly.  Nowhere else makes enchiladas that good!  The food is definitely NOT heart healthy, but it's great for mental health.  I am a big fan of the shredded beef tacos, the crispy bean tostadas, and the yummy chimis.  I would stay away from the fajitas and the salads, though.  I've taken people here, and they don't like the paste-like hot sauce in lieu of salsa, but I'm absolutely addicted.  I always get some to go!  Mrs. Siegel (7th grade Reading Teacher)
4	f67hHyZjt2chvcFMwUTA	Do you know pizza?  Or is pizza an acquaintance to you?   Is pizza a long-term relationship, or is it the Betty that you picked up at Dos Gringos on a Friday afternoon?  If you are truly a student of pizza, you know this:  it's all about the water stupid.  It really shouldn't be a secret why za in NY and C-town is so good.  Hence, apply this rationale and you know the secret to NYPD.  Great za in Phoenix, AZ???  You bet!  Pizza starts with the crust.  Without great crust, you can't have great za.  But...if you make your crust with the exact mineral content of water from Yonkers, NY....you have a great crust!  Top it off with a spicy (not sweet) sauce, and moz that is of good quality and melt, and abracadabra....there it is.  Way to go NYPD...pride in za making....and real ovens too!  Conveyor belt pizza is crapola, meant for California.  I give it my 2nd highest 'sausage and pepperoni' rating, from the NY Pizza Guy.
4	D5BqLuMRJQlSKe5mdV6A	Came here with a large group after a day of tubing on the Salt. The bartender did a great job of accommodating any request we had and the happy hour prices were great!  For dinner I had the Camarones Verdes, a delicious shrimp and poblano chile dish that was not only pleasing to the tongue but also to the eye. Every part of the dish was perfect - the green rice was beautifully plated and deliciously spiced with the poblanos. Every piece of shrimp was cooked just right and so flavorful.  We were admittedly a large and rowdy crowd but were treated nicely and our service was great. Thankfully there was another large group (baby shower??) in the same room as us so we weren't the only loud ones in the place. Our young and obviously new server told me it was the first time he'd ever served such a large party and I can say he was GREAT! He honored all requests and kept his wits and sense of humor about the whole thing and our crazy group!  Los Gringos Locos was a welcome spot for us after a long day in the sun and a place I'd be happy to come back and visit.
2	LB6qPZYwJsctmEcsVZvcQ	Came here for lunch hoping for some decent food and a place to watch the World Cup matches since they had TV's. The hostess seated us at the bar which was fine but I'm not sure if they forgot about people still wanting to order food at the bar as it took us nearly an hour to get our food!  Luckily the bartender tried to salvage the situation and offered our group free drinks but it went downhill afterwards with sub-par food for the price. We all tried something different and portions were small and the food was far too simple for what we were expecting (but at that point we were starving and would've eaten anything). I guess we should've known better to go to a restaurant inside a mall!
2	ZdTpxXTuUw58h8ieoNwUzA	I like the couch area and the pub atmosphere but I didn't appreciate the huge additional "hold" amount that the establishment added onto my debit card.  We're talking at least $30!   This hits a special nerve with me because on another occasion in a different location I used an account that was practically empty and this caused me to overdraw on that account and get charged numerous overage fees.  I think this practice is complete crap and the restaurant should warn the individual since this kind of thing can end up costing a person a pretty penny.  Luckily I had money in my account this time, but imagine my surprise to see an extra $40 tacked onto my bill when I looked at my debit account online.  When I called I was told to check back in a week and if it's still there to contact them then.  Not cool.
4	BkP6IPsd6sikXPoqMQcfA	This is the best Irish pub in the city; while Claddagh is a corporate chain (that isn't quite authentic), and Piper's Pub is a wonderful pub... of the British Isles, Mullaney's is Irish, and a great place to grab some food and drink.  Tons of travelling entertainers and bands, fantastic eats, and friendly, good staff.
2	yklXsoM5X3SI7lpOZvRGQ	This is not the same salads n such that I went to as recent as one month ago. They have raised their prices and changed their menu and a big way. I can understand raising the prices but what they did to the menu I think was a bad idea. They took my favorite sandwich off, got rid of sprouts completely, and the biggest problem is that you no longer get to choose two side items but only one. This place no longer stands out to me. There are too many other sandwich shops that I can go to. The decor is not good, I've been going to this place for many years and it never changes. At the end of my dining experience I tried to redeem my 10% discount for checking in on yelp but they said that that coupon shouldn't be on there. They did go ahead and give me the 10% discount though so that was nice. That will be my last time at salads n such because really they offer nothing different than any other place and now their prices are higher. Just not worth it.
2	dvy3wcOxQy4E01uq4gxkQ	I was so excited to eat at Barringtons for my birthday dinner. I'd heard and read so many rave reviews, I was sure it would be amazing. It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist.   Other than the food lacking that "fine dining" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful. It's not "small/intimate" it's "small/claustrophobic" and oppressively loud! The bar was perpetually full to overflowing into the tiny room and the tables are so tiny there's barely room for the plate and beverage. I'm only 5'2" and 110lbs and I felt like I was sitting at a child's width table at adult height. It felt more like a chain restaurant's ambiance than a place you go for a special occasion that's for sure!   On the whole, a major disappointment. Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.  ADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly "suburban," and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!
4	ioKvb6oMoTeHNOIaoiA	This place has some pretty tasty lunch specials... pick a meal and get salad, cinnamony won-ton chips and rice for $7 (plus drink and tip).  The veggie stir-fyr is really yummy.\r \r It can get pretty crowded around lunchtime so go early, but the service is fast, so once you are seated you won't need to wait long for your food.
4	bIgxgtMcrUM3ZehY1Vw	They are getting a 4 star because of great service.  That is not to say that their food was bad, it was a solid 3 star, but normal what you would expect from a old fashion diner like this.  I had sliders, they also served breakfast all day which looked good.  Everyone was happy, but the stand out tonight was the service of this place.  They take care of everything and really are helpful.
2	b8O9KseIPNRTvx6UDmA	Jillian's is where your office goes to have a big event on the cheap w/ alcohol, some fun and some games (e.g. pool, expensive video games, air hockey).   Atmosphere - Warehouse-ish, dark, woody, open, big, Concord Mill-ish, dated.  Did I say big yet?   Service - Friendly, confused, helpful.  The staff here is very friendly and helpful (gave me a tip on coming in early to watch the fight on the cheap).  They are confused, as two told me the pool table area was open while three told me it was reserved.  I guess it was open reserved?  This kind of stunk, as pool was the reason we went here.  Food - Like Chad said, "you aren't really going for the food, are you?"  This place is all about appetizers and booze, but appetizers do not make a meal.  So I chose the booze.  The mixed drink @ $5.75 was not bad, star added!!    Overall - Jillian's is best if your company invites you, you are with a group of 10 + or if there is some special sporting event being televised.  Other than that, this is not the best game in town.
2	It4hSXn3KR2eJE8EUy9rdw	I am not really sure why people keep going back to Yoshi's!  I ate it once.  ONCE.  It was right across the street from work (the Indian School & Central location) and everyone went there everyday.  So, I figured I would try it.  Now, I ordered chicken, but I'm really not sure what meat it was OR what part of the chicken it was from.  It was really string-fatty-grizzly.  Teriaki sauce was good and the rice was ok, if a bit *too* sticky for my liking.
4	BC1O8Zu3KdW2Yk3U0W3Jg	Cuban food is not very plentiful in Phoenix, but Havana Cafe does a very good job of making it accessible, tasty, and fun.  If you're not sure what Cuban food is, think of a Spanish and Mexican hybrid.  The seafood paella is delicious and a stand out, but everything I've tried on the menu is at least above average.  The food is always consistent and the staff and atmosphere usually have a friendly vibe.  Check it out!
4	avoY9BAOjj77dTcqHnFNA	I've been going here at least twice a month for the past six/seven years.  JT is a hoot.  They have the best wings in the Valley.  Great jukebox.  The new cafe tables are nice, but hard when you have a big group.  Love this place.
2	lXffRAcJ89jZ9sZxnZOcw	The food is overpriced for what they give you- one chicken breast and a spear of broccoli was $22.50. Talk about making a come up!! Not to mention it wasn't seasoned very well.    The interior of the restaurant looks very dated.   The only positive was that we were pressed for time and our waiter was able to accommodate.   Not worth it. I would rather wait for a table next door at Meat and Potatoes than return here even if they are the only place with open tables which was the case tonight.
4	ZHIF7ExAHbBJL5BRrrI38Q	The food is amazing. I love the club sandwich. My husband and I go here for the food and the atmosphere. It is quite homey, I dont like coffee but this would be a perfect place to read the paper and sip a cup of Joe. The cookies are the best if they are cooked right. I find that they do not cook them all the way sometimes. Most of the time I have to get something other than the chocolate chip just because I do not like eating dough.
4	RK7sweLVxF0OvdOe28hiw	I asked some folks coming out of the cafe...how is the breakfast here. They explained that they've tried all the places in town and now always come here. The complimented the food...and then raved about the staff - "Good people."  My experience...matches their description.   Fast, friendly service. The food was simple...and good. The decor is worn western. I love local, quirky, no frills places like this - especially when the people are so nice.
2	PKCRktXyrffXt40WCxYtA	My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like it'd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back.
4	zaGZsJTnQMSXepntO6Vsxg	I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges. Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.  The service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.  But what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!
4	V5gQMJ0NUZj0TQqG7YwMZw	I am a total fan of their drinks....and even a bigger fan of being able to get large drinks for 99 cents before noon and they are half price every day between 2-4pm.   Their slushes are my favorite (lemon-berry especially) but occasionally I have to get a cherry lime...for ol' times sake... This is one of the few places that can make me a pineapple malt when I am in need.  You can stop in at 9am and get breakfast or their burgers...they offer their full menu all day.  Their food is ok.  Often I get a craving for some tater tots or their french toast sticks.  More often than not I order one of their kids packs with a slush and go on my merry way....
2	cdQQwNrfsp5GAUZE5KsFNA	Wow. What horrible service. Took us 10 minutes to order our food and they weren't busy. There were like 5 tables full and 5 waitresses available. The food came pretty quickly after but after we got our food the waitress never came to check back with us. Maybe she would have realized I never touched my food. I've never ordered a chicken Caesar wrap at a restaurant and have it have onions on it and I hate onions. The broccoli cheddar soup looked like it came out of a can. My fiance ordered the fajita skillet and it was decent but the hashbrown we're soggy. Because of the service we will never come back.
2	kc8vgd0lhF3Awgj7gh9VOA	Not much to really say here.  The food was very overpriced and the eatery had kind of a Luby's Cafeteria atmosphere to it.  I can't think of one food item that really stuck out as either bad or good - it was just all pretty bad overall.  I haven't been back on subsequent trips to Vegas.
2	s0V6HYuH6ti5qLyYOHabPw	I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.
4	ZrEhUqeGWll4MhiyyFXiwQ	This is an ok place to hang out.  They have great tv's, pretty good food and off track betting that I have tried a couple times.  This is a Browns bar and While a Lions fan I do root for the Browns.  It has a much more local feel to it.  The staff has very limited turn over and I went there about 5 times in November but when I went back about a month later the bartender asked if I wanted a Blue Moon which is my favorite.  That is pretty neat.
2	PkcvQFKfc42Gq7OhoyDyfw	Definitely not the best first impression I would have liked to have from a sushi restaurant, as when me and my girlfriend walked in we were welcomed with the smell of frying oil (that wasn't really fresh either).   We opted for the AYCE,  priced at 24.99 at dinner (which would be reasonable, but more on that later). Unfortunately, a good number of the rolls we ordered were underwhelming to say the least. The avocado roll (which is one of my personal favorites when done correctly), looked more like a roll of rice with a tiny green vein of avocado running down the middle. The Aladdin roll, although sounding good on the menu, was drenched in a VERY garlicky ponzu sauce which just dominated the whole dish. I was also looking forward to the Jalepeno Popper roll, which was spicy tuna and fresh jalepeno fried tempura style. Quite possibly one of the blandest things I have ever eaten, sadly. Also, service was a tad on the slow side (granted one lady was working, the place had no more than 6 people in it at the time we were there).  Negatives out of the way, there were some tasty rolls to come our way. The Red Rock was particularly good (although not a traditional roll, more like a sushi "lasagna" with layers of rice and spicy tuna with tuna and avocado on top). Also, the Lion King roll was by far the highlight of the night, and one roll I would gladly order again.  Overall, I have to give this place a thumbs down for underwhelming sushi. As for the "all you can eat". They should really consider renaming it "all you can eat in 2 hours", because that rule is plastered at the top of the menu (I've been to quite a few restaurants that have an AYCE option. FIRST time I have ever seen that.). Kinda makes that 24.99 price tag a little heftier in my eyes.
4	CtxqLHFB80H64X62pN0Bw	The food is good and its CHEAP.  I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.  $4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded.   Service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.  They also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.  Try the shakes, they're great.
2	DPehlUcx4JpjdgzmxyGjig	Outrageously overpriced. I can only imagine that some of my fellow reviewers were tanked on wine when they wrote their glowing reviews, because the food is downright lousy.   My girlfriend and I had the soup of the day (chicken rice and curry, which was fine), and a decent salad. But then the tapas started. First, green beans, which were in a delicious sauce but were severely undercooked. Then, the flatbread, which is an awful way to waste $17. It was a chewy, flavorless affair that left us salivating for a $2 frozen pizza back at home. Then the Hangar Steak, which was also undercooked, lukewarm, and utterly bland.  It came paired with an unappetizing and -- brace yourself -- undercooked risotto!   Everything needed pepper, yet none was forthcoming.  It seemed the wait staff was too busy obliging other tables' requests to uncork another bottle of wine.   With drinks and tip, we taught ourselves a $95 lesson: don't eat here again.
2	yoccjG8Gvnqkg5UesWOrtg	There are worse chains and worse fast food joints than Panera.  But I'm not a big fan.  This is a particularly large franchise.  Fairly busy, and has an unfriendly atmosphere.  The can't give a s&%! attitude of the staff contributes to this problem.  They seem pretty unhappy, suggesting either that it's a poor work environment, or they hire or train badly.    They botched my order, acted like this was my problem, and more or less threw the bag at me when it came up the 2nd time.  I'm giving them 2 stars rather than 1 because the reincarnation of my order actually tasted alright, though I had to rush to eat it because it was so late in arriving.  Bottom line - if you have mediocre food to start with, good service is pretty much mandatory.  This joint needs to get its act together.
4	NUzCfu6QQiyf7WbTtzssOQ	I hadn't been to a Panda Express in a while and was craving some chow mein.   I decided on a bowl so as to not get enough food for multiple meals, lol.  There were a lot of different entree items that I hadn't seen before & I decided to try the Firecracker Chicken Breast. I was warned up front that it was really spicy, which made me want it even more :D  I have to say, it is very tasty and it does have a little kick. Definitely my new favorite!  When in doubt the staff encourages you ask for a taste :)  Location is clean, staff is friendly, lots of parking available.
2	pZ9i3TGLEj3CFkaV6xm4oA	Their prices are getting out of control.  FOR SALAD?  Dudes, your dinner prices are getting exorbitant.  At these rates, the "premium" items like the proteins should be included with the meal.   Sorry Sweet Tomatoes, you just priced yourself out of the ballpark.  Back to SouperSald.  Just crazy lately!!!
4	LkroNeeUgN6beryGkZIpQ	Stan and his kids are really friendly, and The Doughboy is a great brown-bag sandwich.  This place is part of my Central/Camelback routine, right between getting my haircut at Central Barbershop and heading over to All About Books & Comics or AJ's.    Price:  Good Atmosphere: Okay, don't really go there for the place Service: Great Food: Great  Only problem, they run out of Yoo-Hoo's half the time.
4	2my1ksTBEgNU64kWzlxdQ	Im giving WB 4 stars, simply for the 'Full' factor.  Its Whataburger, cmon people.  Everyone knows by now, that fast food NEVER looks like the advertisements.  That's why I was not surprised when I got my Sweet N Spicy double the other day.  You couldn't even see the bacon on onions, unless yopu took off the top bun.  BUT the flavors were there.  And its a big chunk of burger. It takes quite a bit to fill me up, and a Whataburger double does the trick.  The fries were decent, as well.  I had avoided this place for awhile, as it never seemed busy, and that worried me. But it was all for not. Next I will be trying the breakfast on a bun sandwhiches.
4	xVZ24JdW7TDrGvJUB5FpQ	The biscuits. Seriously!  That's why I come. The rest of the food is pretty good too but nothing beats the biscuits. As far as the rest of the food,  tried something new and got the lobster artichoke dip. It was really good however the chips were extremely salty. I got the caesar side salad. Good but a little heavy on the dressing. Then came the ultimate feast. I wasn't really hungry at this point but leftover seafood isn't great. The shrimp, lobster and crab were great. I didn't try the rice and I only ate a couple of fries which were also very salty. As far as the service it was pretty good. Took a little long to be greeted and get our waters but it wasn't horrible.
4	s6ufCPlpsTEXFHnAah9ZlA	Food is great but the restaurant is pretty dirty in the seating area. Peeling wallpaper dirty baseboards food on floor etc. Staff is nice. Men's room is pretty bad, dirty grout broken tiles dirty floor smells like urine. I am visiting Mesa so maybe that is the standard here but it could be improved a lot. Dirty restrooms seem like it may be an indicator of other problems. But food is great. Update: came back again the next day. Salsa bar us awesome. Highly recommended. I hope they can clean up a bit.
2	dHtI9zahZU8Xs1Bgr94ICA	The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.    The first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.  The menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.
2	uLdORKLZCKv0G85d6eYlcw	I found a 2/1 coupon in the print edition of the RJ.  We dined at the Tropicana location approximately 4 years ago, but this was our first time at this location.  It took awhile for anyone to wait on us after being seated, but we eventually were served industrial taco chips and two bottled salsas.  Our cheese enchiladas were accompanied by the usual refried beans, dried out Spanish rice and iceberg lettuce salad.  The enchiladas were tasty, but everything else was very mediocre.
4	oIVTn43CqrSWrr6ugllD8g	So my wife and I stumbled upon this place. We followed the advice of some dude yelling to us from across the street. I must say, it quickly became our Saturday morning tradition. I recommend the "Sancho" omelet. Take the ordinary "Pancho" omelet and add chorizo instead of ground beef. "For when Pancho isn't giving you enough chorizo, its time for Sancho"
4	2s2uFd4GUR6VfhQq9eoFDA	This is an interesting little Mediterranean restaurants / market. The decor is very simple. The market takes up about 2/3rds of the space the remainder for the restaurant. It is rarely very busy so getting a table at lunch is easy. I used to get the Chicken Shawarma but since the buffet was put in I just stick with that. All the meats are halal if that is important to you.   The lunch buffet on Friday and Saturdays is a must, the chicken has some kind of spice that just rocks. I always eat way to much of the chicken. Everyone I have brought here just raves about it.  The buffet is simple with hummus, chopped salad, lamb (I don't eat lamb), chicken, rice, and a couple of other dishes that get rotated. They will also bring hot pita bread upon request.   The only down comment is that the service is kind of slow with drink refills. On numerous occasions I have had to get up and go to the counter to get a refill of water. No fresh brewed iced tea, booo! There is always one guy (the same guy) waiting tables. The food makes up for this.
2	m7C8bkyMhgcrcTOlwD0LBQ	I was so excited to go get my cheesecake factory fix for the year and then I remembered why I only go once every 14 months, if that.  :( server was super awkward and not very personable...but I really liked their small plates menu, great way to try a few things, keep on budget and not stuff your face before it's time for a piece of their cheesecake.
4	WHnRSMRJQ42TQMJhkmwWQ	It was my birthday a couple weeks ago, so I figured, what better way to celebrate than with some NY pizza!  Granted, the place was a little out-of-date, sorely in need of a soapy scrubbing and the guy who took my order could have been polite enough to HANG UP THE CELLPHONE while he took my order.  Honestly, I didn't know when he was talking to me or the phone.  Other than that, he was friendly enough, the pizza didn't take long (I stood & waited while it baked), and the order-taker guy helped out an elderly gentleman to order more food for less money (how sweet, right?).  I had my favorite combo: mushroom & onion.  it was greasy, cheesy & just perfect!  The crust was crisp, the pie was hot.  The only thing I could complain about was I did have a couple of onionskin pieces on the pizza.    Overall, tasty slices & I'd be pleased to enjoy another pizza, but I might order beforehand.
4	FUbNH3fZRItbTYEW7HJQ	What is the proper name for a olive farm anyway? I am sure it is not a garden, it can't be a vineyard, orchard or patch so what could it be? I guess this is why there are no olive dishes on the menu at the olive garden.  Like any other chain the food is predictable and sometimes uninspired. However there are several dishes here that are well executed and the sheer volume of food helps this chain break the 3 star chain curse  I went here with my family for dinner as they are afraid to try anything new. I started my meal with the included minestrone soup, which is vegetarian. It is good once I add half a shaker of pepper to it.  For my main dish I went with the Manicotti formaggio. The ricotta is what really makes this dish special here, it is firm, dry and flavourful compared to the watery creamy found at most places. The dish comes with three large flat pieces covered in a chunky tomato sauce and topped with melted mozzarella. Of coruse there also was the obligatory over salted bread sticks.   This particular location is due for a renovation, I really hope the new chairs are similar as they are one of the few comfortable chairs to be found at a restaurant.
2	hlLoS1Hdw4NKpG5PYA7Buw	To set the record straight, the service here was great.  The food...not so much.  Started off with some chips and salsa...pretty standard.  Had two different types of salsas...one hot and one mild.  Had two carnitas tacos, which came with rices and beans.  The rice and beans were good...beans were pretty rich.  The carnitas were pretty dry, but the worst part was the tacos were topped with this even more dry cabbage, onion, cilantro mixture.  I had to add a lot of salsa to make the tacos interesting.  I also tried the shrimp burro...aka a big shrimp burrito.  This actually wasnt that bad...pretty simple with some nice grilled shrimp and fajita-esque veggies.  The last thing I tried was the beef enchiladas.  The beef seemed to be machaca and it was tender.  The problem with the dish was that the enchilada sauce was extremely rich...it tasted like a mixture between velveeta cheese and hormel chili, which is one of my favorite tailgating foods...not my favorite enchilada topping.    With the number of mexican restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix...there is no need for me to come back here.
4	hLYUErqvAoFS0RaIqDSRoA	My favorite thing on the menu is the Margherita Pizza. It is a delicious, deep dish masterpiece. Their white pizza is also very good. Stick to the pizza here--the only other thing I had on their menu was a burger and it was not so good.  The bar is pretty cool - friendly bartender.  They are also very quick to deliver, usually within 20-30 minutes.
2	lhSBTj4Ft0v2CDEI0KV94A	This is a sorority ran facility. I was uncomfortable the majority of the time I was there. Lots of pool tables is nice. The clientele is all male and I'm not surprised with the staff they have. I will not go back to this Baileys/Fox and the Hound.
4	Bb1lXxb62d83rBLA2QtxHQ	I always have a good experience at this location. Even when it's packed at lunch time they get you in and out as quickly as possible.   Service is always good. Everyone that works there seems to be happy and that they like their jobs. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty. There is even a small but, clean seating area if you want to dine in.   My only complaint is how the parking lot is set up. There are two different entrances but, only one exit that is next to the drivethru line. If the drivethru is backed up then you have to either wait or go out of one of the entrances which can cause an accident.
4	mLrNBwaj9OoGZIJPwRdwGg	I enjoyed this place, but wasn't completely wowed.  I was told that it's Portuguese, but I'm not seeing what's so Portuguese about it.  Certainly a good Continental restaurant, by any means.    I liked the atmosphere, and the service was good.  And the food was good too.  But for the price, I didn't think the food was THAT great.  I'll come again, but it won't be because I'm the one suggesting it.
2	PESwYZiKAC7y88cCKOB6g	Food was fair, but drinks are overpriced for the type of restaurant it is, and service has been very disappointing at times. Once I waited 20 minutes before my waiter acknowledged me and my drink order was taken.   You might just do better going to Outback Steakhouse almost next door. Or, better yet, Fajitas a few blocks north.
2	2CtdkSJwLYInS1jdshlrsQ	Not impressed with service and food was decent.  it's a good place for sharing during lunch, though.  don't order a dish for yourself!!  i hate places where you have to ask for refills even on WATER!  we were a party of 2 and a party of 4 sat down 10 min after us, they got their lunch b4 us.  WTF!  the smoked salmon with capers and cream cheese with toast is YUMMY great for breakfast or a light lunch.
2	aYCHeyznJhK1V1cYARgXQ	Was psyched to hear they have a gluten-free menu. Although there are only 2 flavors-Pei Wei Spicy & the sweet & sour. That's good for my SO since he likes sweet & sour. I'm not a s&s fan so I'm stuck with just rice- would have liked the spicy but it's made with chicken broth so not vegetarian friendly which explains why they only list meat options on their gluten-free menu. If they would switch to veggie broth then we would get takeout weekly. But I can't get satisfied with just rice so they lost my biz. Staff is friendly but some really have no clue about the gf menu - for take out they gave packets of regular soy sauce when they have gf tamari. 2 stars because they made an attempt, and with a few tweaks could be a 4 or even 5 star.
2	FIQyE4zlaQF6iCQXkDnBw	The wings are good and there are plenty of sauces to choose from. And they come out crispy! Wednesday is wing day so you'll get a pretty good discount. The food comes out pretty quickly and the prices are reasonable.  The place itself, isn't anything fancy or nice. Just a seat and a table. Don't expect any atmosphere, which is no big deal.  What I don't like about Wiggies is the lack of ventilation. YOU WILL SMELL LIKE WINGS! If that doesn't bother you, you'll be fine. But unfortunately, I only go there if I know I don't have to be anywhere important. I avoid this place for lunch because I simply don't like smelling like a grease pit in my work clothes. I'd rather go after work or on my day off.
4	omp02QCOtKQmKELsd7Aw	I can't say it's going to swoop you into the streets of Shanghai but the $4.99 lunch specials here are blatant American highway robbery. For soup, rice, a choice of SOMETHING, cream cheese wontons, sit-down service and check-splitting, I commend this establishment for keeping its head above water. I shall return.
4	FfpF1moLoVPiDoNliWIGgw	Grabbed lunch here on a Tuesday and it was packed! The lunch specials are great--you get so much food and for a good price. I ordered the calabash shrimp and was overwhelmed with how many you got (a whole plate filled!!).   I'm eager to come back and try breakfast as there seemed to be a breakfast special for $5 or so before 1130.
4	ycOWpNomFS4pjUIrzUHmKQ	This place has been here forever. Though, it has undergone a serious facelift over the past three or four months. The food is equally good, if not slgihtly better, and there is even talk of making it a bar at night. Booze and fried wontons? Yes, please!  The layout actually might lend itself successfully to a bar. You have the little takeout counter that opens up into an outdoor section that leads into another room. It hasn't happened yet, but it could be like a little Devil's Martini waiting to happen. Keep your eyes out for it!
2	G1OuWoNRrO7Sk7oYh7A	Went to this place on glowing reviews from a native, however, after the hype I was pretty disappointed.  The service was really great, but I wanted a tasty pizza, and this pizza was not tasty.  Maybe I am spoiled coming from the East Coast(great pizza), and then living in Chicago(mecca of pizza).  The crust was so blah and the sauce had no flavor.
4	oAWKQYcf9jnvIHSsw3yMQ	Great food. Has a local feel, not quite dive-y but pleasantly local. Not unexpected based on the location. Went for the Bell's tap take-over for Mad-Craft-Beer-Week. Wife and I had the fish, right tastee.
2	JwkhHbOijEX27BpkvjGcXg	Service was great but the prices and food quality couldn't save this place for me.  The food was okay but it's breakfast not rocket science so I want expecting to drop 20.00 on breakfast for one. I had coffee with a waffle, eggs and sausage and added a side of potatoes.
4	oNpXBI6YiDbUU3fNFzpg	I went here last night with the BF and his parents, and overall it was a good experience. I had made a reservation for 7, but we got there at 6:30, so we had to wait. Luckily, it was happy hour! We got two margaritas (some specialty margarita with agave nectar and deliciousness), a miller lite, and a blue moon. All of that for 17$....pretty good deal. They sat us a bit before 7, so that was nice (especially because the wait time was 60-70 minutes without reservations). Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I had the delmonico steak and it was delicious! Spicy and perfectly cooked.... It came with southwest au gratin potatoes that were just ok.... The BF and his dad got prime rib, which was good (but not nearly as good as mine). His dad really likes this place because they will give you real horseradish if you request it (not just the sauce). His mom also enjoys this place despite the fact that she is a vegetarian. They are very accommodating, and she got a salad and a potato and was happy with that. Oh, and I had a 10$ off coupon they sent me for my birthday through their e mail club...so definitely sign up for that.   Despite the fact that this place is a chain, I would come back here...they have quality food.
4	6QBAWaKwhfMdl6Z6qZqN5g	Really great Mexican food. Some of the best in Charlotte along with Las Margaritas. The prices are great and the service is too. One of the benefits of coming here is the ability to host groups and get them fed in a good amount of time. Splitting a check is never difficult as it can be at some restaurants. The food is pretty good, but the last visit here left me with a very very greasy quesadilla. But, for the price, you can hardly argue with it.
4	J9fDjwbvJE1irryhxAFvWA	My husband and I went to Morton's couple months ago. We just came back from our anniversary trip. It was late at night, we were tired and starving after a long flight. We decided to top our anniversary with a visit to Morton's.  We both got steaks (I took the fillet mignon). They were really, really good. The sides were so-so. We skipped desert and got coffee instead.  The ambiance was very relaxing, subdued and quite intimate. It helped there were only 3 other tables being served that late at night. I was very pleased with the service. Attentive, knowledgeable and witty.  As expected the tab was pricey, around $100 (dinner for 2, two rounds of drinks and coffee) but was worth it as an anniversary gift. I wouldn't go there for a regular dinner.
4	A0BE8wd9kBXWRMBkMrXZQ	There is better pizza to be had, and there are places with better beer selections. There is no place in Champaign-Urbana with a better beer selection that also serves pizza, though, and the pizza is not half bad, if you like your crust cracker-thin and crisp. I like the smoked salmon.   I was very sad on my recent visit home to find that Bell's no longer distributes in Illinois. That is tragic. You can still get Lindeman's on draft though; I'm not sure you can even get that at the Blind Pig.   I can't wait to go home again now that C-U is smoke-free. I will be able to enjoy this place at times other than 2 PM when there are actually other humans there.
4	GEwYJoKh0uRvMHDmNZTVsQ	Great atmo for a mon. Bartender is nice and they have all the bar games. Ping pong, darts (all their darts are broken, bring your own if ya can), shuffle board, golden tee and pac man!  Great neighborhood bar.
2	OGZXgo9V2VsqQ6nxnKmE1A	I stopped in here by myself this past Saturday at around 6:30 in the evening.  I had been here once before but it had been a number of years prior.  Man was this place packed!  I had trouble finding a parking spot and upon entering the restaurant there were no open tables and about 10 people waiting for their orders.  Since I was due elsewhere later in the evening I decided to order four cuts of pepperoni to go.  After that I sat down on a chair to wait.  It was at this point that I heard one of the employees telling another that they should tell everyone it would be about a 30 minute wait.  Thankfully it only ended up being a 15 minute wait before I was out the door and into my car.  So how did the pizza taste?  Sorry Beto's and the South Hills but I just don't get cold cheese and toppings on top of a baked crust.  This is now two times that I have tried it and this time I was prepared for it and more than willing to give it a better chance.  However it just does not work for me.  The positives for the pizza are that the crust is super crispy, almost cracker like, which I really liked.  I don't know that I have had another pizza crust that was this crispy before.  There was also a ridiculous amount of cheese on my four slices which I consider to be a good thing.  As to the negatives of the pizza, the main one is the cold toppings.  To me it doesn't really feel right and I am not a fan of it.  This also causes a secondary issue of the pizza being extremely messy to eat.  Since the cheese hasn't melted together and also hasn't melted the toppings on, it goes everywhere.  The bottom line for me is that I probably will not be back again in the future.  While I know that many people love it, it really doesn't do it for me.
4	w5YgXnrFajlz7KsVfnc9A	This restaurant is in a bit of a transition. Downstairs is a cafeteria style experience that has been the standard for the restaurant. Recently the restaurant received a liquor license and started full service upstairs. Our server was very friendly and described all of the proposed changes including closing up the upstairs, but making the roofing retractable so that it could be opened on nice days.   The views from upstairs were great - despite not much in the surrounding area to look at other than ran down buildings. At least the mountains provided a good view. The linens on the table and full service made it a wonderful experience. The food was good too - we started with the freshly made guacamole. It was just as good as Cafe Laredo, but half the price. I went with a margarita for $8, which really I could skip. I ordered frozen, but didn't get it and in general it was just kind of average. The chips were very good and the salsa very good. I ordered the beef taco with carne asada - which was surprisingly really spicy. I finished with dessert - the churros and the newly introduced sundae - neither were really impressive.   While the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the server was a bit slow. I am sure that will improve as they get more experience with the full service. The entree and the app was exceptional - skip the drink and dessert and it would be perfect. Overall it was just over $50, but subtract the $8 drink, the price for the churro and sundae and it would be a good meal at a good price.   While the bar isn't very high, this is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. I will be back frequently.
2	DEwE8FZvTMeoivm1apr8Q	Ever had a fish sandwich? I have. Have they ever put a slab of cheese on it? Once, and that was here. I am never, ever ordering a fish sandwich here. The wings here are absolutely terrible and gave me diarrhea. Everything else is pretty good. Rib tips are smoked very well. Brisket is good. The wings and fish sandwich took 2 stars away.
4	EpIrcxA7rw22HNZ3bpsJxw	This is my favorite wing place.  The owners are really nice and they are very accomodating if you have any special instructions for your wings.  Lots of flavor combinations.  This is a place where you want to place your order to go.   I suggest the Red Tang flavor.  Yum !!  They are also now doing Pizza although I've never tried it.  http://tlcwingsandgrill.com/
4	NCqyskDPXcRuWi461q49Yg	I've been to about 5 different BJs and this is by far my favorite. The food is the same as at most other BJs, although this one has honey breadsticks that I haven't seen anywhere else. What distinguishes this BJs is the brewer. In addition to the usual BJs brews, this brewer concocts new original brews all the time, found only here, and brewed on premises. One time I had a BJs Belgian style Grand Cru here that rocked my world. The only problem is that it's super crowded and there is usually a wait. Plus it's at the Chandler mall, so it's...mall-ish.
4	7dvBi3jnXfhXV0z7FvkHA	The Village Green is a Wisconsin bar with Packer memorabilia, formica tables and mismatched chairs, and better than average food.  It wasn't the best burger I've ever had and the fries and mushrooms were frozen.  The corned beef sandwich was fresh but not fantastic.   But it was adequate and I'd return if I had a hankering for WI bar food.   I felt like I'd been here before the minute I walked in - the menu and atmosphere were indistinguishable from other taverns I'd been to.  Their tap beer selection was good and its obvious they do a lot of business.  If this is what you are looking for, they do it well!
2	aKhYAM01hzlEZlPWYKhFg	Stayed inside the Hilton which is connected to the property. Came out for Breakfast three monrings, and waiters have a grouchy face the whole time. No Greeting, nothing, granted it's buffet, but a smile is nice. One morning, my husband and I got up to get some sugar for coffee, and noticed that the table had been cleared and another guests stuff was sitting on our table. Told the guy that and his answer was, "go ahead and sit at the table next to it" no apologies or nothing.  The potatoes at the breakfast were constantly running out. Why not making bigger batches? the coffee station was out of stirring sticks one day.   The bf was so-so.
2	GUeYf9G1MoBxcM22C3MwOA	I've gone here a few times to see bands. It's alright. The bar is fairly large, and they have volleyball outside. I've never been impressed with the barstaff. Not exactly running up to greet you and get your order, and the mixed drinks are always a bit off. I've never had any of the food, but I've heard it's decent. I will go here again if there's a band I want to see(because it's only a few blocks from home), but you'll never hear me say "Whadya say we go to the Tavern for a night of fun?!?!"
4	fMhc4aSpJ2jq7Wbl2UPBQ	I tried Tom's for the first time today in my qwest for tasty barbecue close to home.  I had a brisket sandwich with fries.  The brisket was tender and smokey.  I just happen to not be a fan of sweet BBQ sauce and Tom's sauce almost bowled me over with the smell and flavor of cinnamon or nutmeg in the sauce.  The only other sauce option appeared to be hot.  I would have scored this place better if there was another sauce option.  Other than that the establishment was clean and the staff friendly.  I would definitely recommend this to people who enjoy the sweet BBQ sauce.
2	kQVcOZ9UJb8zIIk6kLN0g	I have seen better and I can't say that I've seen worse. This is a very small McD's with only a few tables inside and a couple outside. Watching the crew for a bit, they seemed to be taking quite a while to get orders together and get people out the door. I wouldn't recommend this one if you're in a rush.  It has the usual stuff of McDonald's - a Coke fountain, ice tea urns and napkin dispensers but ketchup only in packets. Credit card machines have the touchless sensors if your card supports that.  On the plus side, the dining room is open 24 hours and they have three power outlets next to bolted-down tables and chairs. The wifi works well and the parking lot is well lit. There is a TV but it wasn't on when I was here.
4	Aaj0Vq6UphFR1WVJ9nqX8g	I like this place for take-out or casual dining. I've had the Kung Pao Chicken, Honey Spicy Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Pepper Steak, Chicken with Vegetables, Chicken Lo-Mein, Hot and Sour Soup, and egg rolls and liked it all. Recommended!
4	Wp3Wp0PVi2kqcYlh4SKww	This is the place to get a great slice of sicilian pizza.   My co-workers and I agree that this is one of the best sicilian slices in the city. Crispy and airy crust make the enormous slices not too heavy and they hold a lot of toppings really well. Plus their sauce and topping choices really round out this pizza. Their regular NY style slices are decent, but I would definitely go for the sicilian.   The hoagies are all pretty good too, as a good Italian place should do. Not the most veg-friendly place. Other than the toppings on the pizza, they serve a side salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce, and they put deli ham on the salad, which in my opinion is completely unnecessary. Seems like they are just serving to the over meaty and under-vegged Pittsburgh eaters (who whould be confronted with more good veggie dishes more often). But their homemade Italian dressing is great.   Service is great here. It's family run and the Grandmother and Mother waitress, always with a smile and friendly banter. Seems like Papa and son are in the kitchen serving up the food. Plus there is outside seating which is often available even on crowded days in the square.   Looks can be deceiving, because I don't think I would have ever checked this place out by just looking at it from the outside, or inside for that matter. A good recommendation from a friend got me here, so hopefully it works for you too.
2	OtCgqHOtqfHe7Rsvm8RA	Am I the only hater on here?  The store seemed really messy to me and my ultimo burrito (or whatever the called it) was soggy.  Pretty sure I could feed the burrito to my 5 month old daughter and her pediatrician would not have objected.  That's how soggy it is.  It's also possible that a combination of Cafe Rio in combination with the plethora of authentic Mexican Food in this city has spoiled me in regards to Mexican food.  The salsa was really chunky too.  I know some people enjoy the consistency of a good pico de gallo but that is really not my thing.  Bottom line is I did not enjoy my lunch here.  I thought it was over priced for the quality of what I got.  It's the southwest man...THE SOUTHWEST.  You can get to Mexico in 6 hours...you can do better than Baja Fresh.
2	4VI6yeOEGpMm1c3nEupmdA	Went here with my people and it was just okay. I've never really been an On The Border fan and I seem to forget that until I go again and decide I don't really like the food (again). This time I tried some enchiladas (my favorite) but they put this weird white sauce on it and it was not yummy. Chips and salsa were good but that's about it.
4	3lrIz2J5wznlasBTUNtaQ	This may be too harsh, but I think Umi is the only Pittsburgh restaurant that can rival other restaurants of the same culinary category in major U.S. cities. Perhaps not too surprisingly, it is reminiscent of Morimoto of Philadelphia (Umi's Executive Chef, Mr. Shu, is said to have apprenticed under the famed Iron Chef).  The menu is not cheap. Since I only go when I'm in the mood to splurge, I've only ever ordered the omakasi (tasting menu). Actually, in the market of tasting menus, a set that is still under $100 is arguably a bargain.   Mr. Shu uses fresh and high quality ingredients, and he prepares the dishes with a light sophisticated touch. Of the multiple courses, my favorites are the tuna tartar and the kobe steak.  If I have to point to a weakness, it is that Mr. Shu's range is relatively narrow.  A bit more variety could really bring the meal to a whole new level.
2	qb0W0lhR75tErKEQbiZ7A	To try someplace new, we visited the Akropolis Cafe one day for lunch.  We sat ourselves at a table in a rather blah setting.  Nobody came by and then...nobody came by.  We looked around and noticed that there was one other table of people and someone standing for takeout.  Both sets were waiting for their food.  Angrily.  And apparently only one person working?  He was doing the cooking.  It soon became evident that it was a family owned business...and only one family member showed up for work that day.  As the woman waiting for her takeout became vocal, we decided to duck out and go somewhere else.  I only get an hour for lunch...and I didn't want to spend it sitting at a table with no service watching a fight break out.    So, sad to say, my review is based only on the service I experienced and observed during a visit one day for lunch to Akropolis Cafe.  I have not yet been back, and based on that experience during what should have been a slow period of the day, most likely won't give them a second chance.  I'd hate to see what happens when they actually might have a full restaurant!
2	JnlStuRegfO3fTYTk1BJZA	Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.
2	TQ6UruBoDSqXZan0X8IfA	My husband and I visited this location and we were disappointed as the food was not as tasty as it had been years ago. It was truly over priced and greasy. We heard that Red Lobster's had down graded in its quality but never would have believe it until we experienced it for ourselves. And we were not satisfied customers.  Oh well for us...we will not be going back for the greasy over price food.
2	eQYsAPM1nEqyehkvbXPFIQ	I don't dine in at this place, I either take out or get delivery. The word for this place is SLOW, and the pizzas are usually late and cold. You can usually count on a full hour for delivery. I prefer Pizza Hut's food to Dominos or Papa John's but those other places run circles around this one for service and time. Would love to see these folks kick it into high gear because I'd eat there a lot if they would improve their delivery time.
4	4FXcJC2H08RzY6Z7PmYfA	I usually avoid chain restaurants, but Rock Bottom is pretty consistently good everywhere I go. I was in Phoenix for a week and the Arrowhead location was a short walk from my hotel, so I ended up hanging out there a few times. The staff was friendly, and the food and brews were tasty. It was nice to have a go-to place when I was too tired or too lazy to look for something else, but even when I went out to other places, I didn't feel the service was as good as I got at Rock Bottom. One guy in particular, Jason, remembered my name on my second visit, which made me feel right at home.
2	IH5bM7BReORNBxRvrsValg	Brought the family to Tom's last weekend, and was disappointed.  On the positive side, the prices were excellent, much better than the canonical breakfast spots in the strip.  However, the food was heavy, greasy, and made from mediocre ingredients.  I didn't care for the spinach  / feta omelet, the kids' pancakes were heavy, and the home fries were greasy.  True, the place felt 50s, but kind of worn out.   We won't go again.
2	Ls1nG6SY16DrW4sfB4cw	Pretty tasty, but for some reason they have the most squishy beans in the world. It's like... a muddy paste of beans, nothing like what the beans could have been. The shells were broken on my tacos, so I normally stick with Chalupas at this location. I'm a little ashamed just to admit to you guys that I go here. Vegetarian fast food options are limited. :(
4	cZIIG2P48ZQ8ZibGAUr1g	One of the better Panda locations around town.  The atmosphere is nice due to its location within the shopping plaza and all the things that are easy to walk to before / after eating.  The staff was friendly and offered samples of anything we were interested in trying before choosing what we wanted to eat.    I ordered my regular two item plate with orange chicken and a chicken egg roll with rice. He tried the new sesame chicken and the orange chicken with rice.  The rice always seems to be off at these locations, just a touch undercooked everytime, but I always want it to be good so I order it.  No lessons ever learned.  Ha!  The place was very clean and everything was well stocked as far as condiments and the like.   Overall: A It's fast food Chinese, so I know what I'm getting myself into - but as far as the locations go, this one is definitely a good one to hit up when you have that craving.
2	O5P2cz1RMO40MKo91l3FA	Let me just say that the Parmesan Chicken Sub from Pizza Extreme is AMAZING!!! I love that thing, and have gotten it there off and on for years.  I just am giving this a 2 star rating because the last two times in a row I've been to the Fish Hatchery location, I've gotten terrible customer service (though in fairness, it's always from the same person).  The Raymond Rd location I've had exceptional service from, and the food is all the same (yummy!)
2	SEPu5OhK2EeYawa6z4AW2g	I've been to this Denny's more than once, but it's never more than a 2 star place.   The most recent time, there was only one server, and about 6 tables to serve with large groups. It took us 20 minutes to get us drinks. Now I am not blaming the server because I know how harsh that is, and you can tell the server had an attitude because of the shortage of help.   This corporation makes enough money to employ more workers. Denny's should be ashamed and If I was that waiter I would have walked out, because that is too much strain for one person!  Only reason Denny's is a good choice is because the prices of food is good.
4	oMG1Y3Bf8GDnDinKZ8sag	Ate here today with the family.  We were sat promptly and had to wait a little for a server.  The manager noticed this quickly and got on it and resolved the issue before we had to ask.  Our server Steph was great and attended to us with professionalism.  We have not been to this Red Robin in years and plan to continue to come back when in the neighbor hood.  Overall impressed.  Had the BLTA croissant for the first time.  Could use a little more avocado but I enjoyed it.  I recommend this restaurant.
4	1Bjcb1hiwlj7Qbp2Gl92w	I refuse to eat sushi in southwestern PA because I am disappointed every single time. Little Tokyo on the other hand has won over my heart. Their sushi may not be the best I have ever had but it is definitely has my invisible stamp of approval. The place is a decent size with average decor and nice staff. I would have given this place three stars based on food, service and decor alone but the one chef did something so amazing for me that I added on an extra star. I requested a roll that wasn't on the menu and it took a lot persuading (our waitress) to bring the idea to the chef. Our waitress explained to the chef would I asked for and she said that he will try his best. All I have wanted since moving to this area is a delicious avocado and inari roll. And that is exactly what I got. I no longer worry about sushi in this area.
2	fZO52LQU2WfjqLto0JdPqg	Trust me, you're much better off eating at Panda Express.  Went here because some Yelpers said it was a decent Chinese place on the strip. Repeat, the strip.  First off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.  We were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.  Like I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.  Two stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.  Another fine review by S.G. Whoop, whoop, whoop!
2	p9fknC0okIBsNwxFXFtUZw	Ok ... Good tasting meatballs, average salad ... nice to have 5 veggie mix in the rice along with some scrambled eggs but way too much black pepper IMO ... was it worth 10 bucks for a special with a cup of hot tea? ... a bit high
2	9AvHomTB45ModA3dT8vwQ	I have a huge love for two things, ramen and lasagna. Tonight was a lasagna night.  After browsing around yelp for about 30minutes I ended at cafe Verdi.   The online ordering had some issues, so I ended up calling the restaurant to order. Phone gets picked up and she informs me that the wait was going to be 1 hour 15mins due to there only being one driver. Since I prefer ordering in advance I was fine with it. Very polite, took my order, made it quick and before hanging up once again informed me with the wait time. So very satisfied with her service.   I ended up waiting about 1 hour and 45 minutes. By the time the order was here, I was starving, looking forward to my food. However very nuke and though the bowl looked huge half of it was sauce, with very little noodles. As hungry as I was, and the what I had to go through, and there not being much food to it I still managed to not finishing it which the bread and sauce went to the dogs plate.  However quite satisfied with tiramisu. Highly doubt it was made in the restaurant, but I will give credit for it satisfying my sweet tooth. If it weren't for that and my mimosa I had with my meal, I would have had to cooked something up for myself.   This time I had gotten delivery but it's not that I was dissatisfied with the entire meal so I will be going in as dine-in and give it another try.
4	hFY8UxWkiASdSpctOzvg	I used to eat at the lone Baja Fresh in Raleigh, NC before it closed, so I was excited to finally be able to eat some of their fish tacos once again.  They were as good as I remembered them being too! I got a grilled and a crispy fish taco.  Both were good, but the grilled was probably the better of the two.  The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor, but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it.  The service was friendly and the food came out quickly.
4	8yiqYe8IpPIAqC6LaYuBA	Good: The food is almost always great, and the other times it's good. I've never had a plate that I said, "meh" to yet. When I call for delivery they always answer the phone within seconds. All of the staff I've had the pleasure to talk to are friendly enough for it being so busy. Their website is easy enough to navigate and to put an order together before calling.  Bad: It can be a little pricey if you are ordering for more than two people. If the prices were down just a little bit I'd give them 5 stars.  Other Thoughts: The driver for their deliveries is the man! He's always very friendly and indulges me when I want to chit-chat with him.
2	2jTwYG6BGkc4cAQv1PQVwQ	Love Papa Johns Pizza but kinda sucks when the delivery time is over an hour and half. But it's cool, I'll just go pick up the pizza, right?? NOPE! Can't pick up the pizza, delivery only... It's 10:40pm by the way. Ridiculous. Dominoes it is! Not cool Papa. Lost my business.
4	Bet3zlEwA9ykSwTNt6JA	This place was very good for the excellent price.  I especially loved the beef noodle soup which had a dark rich broth and lots of noodles and meat. I was in a soup mood on this chilly evening and I had three small bowls of it.  The chicken with star noodles was also good.  I had two bowls of it.  I only had a taste of the potato-leek and was too full to appreciate it.    The salads were fresh and tasty but I was running out of room so I couldn't finish them.  There was only one piece of pizza left, which I ate.  It had good flavor, though was more like frozen pizza than pizza parlor type. The Caesar salad was gone when we first went thru so I didn't taste it.  My daughter went back for some and liked it.   She said the ice cream was real good at the end.  I only had room for a tiny piece of sweet honeydew melon and small portion of strawberries, both good.    The dinner was $5.79 for me and $6.79 for her and we both felt like it was a bargain.  While it was buffet, the girl walking around kept checking with all the customers see if they needed anything.    There wasn't anybody at the cash register when we walked in even tho we waited a couple of minutes so we went ahead and went thru the line.  I'm sure we could have left without paying as nobody seemed to realize we hadn't paid, except that's not my style, so we tracked somebody down to pay when we were finished.   They had already closed out the cash registers since it was closing time and couldn't take my credit card so I paid cash and received a handwritten receipt.  But the manager and helper we chatted with at the end were so nice it balanced off the negative.  Oh, and I especially looked carefully at the trays and dishes after reading an earlier review but everything was very clean.  So was the table we sat at, though we did change tables as the first booth we sat at was very small and left us no "growing room."  The other booth was spacious and fine.  Next time I'm in a soup mood, this is my place to go!
2	iQ97wPXsDOh58bXUCpCW3w	The service is decent, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. You can get a better burger, with exactly what you want on it, for a little less money at Fuddruckers a half mile west of here. You won't have a server to bring your burger and have to apply your own toppings, but that's a better setup in my opinion plus there is nobody to tip!
2	B6s6QwPdCcnXIrddRfDPg	We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time... We placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training...  Hubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)... 5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...  Our daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...  OK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (  But the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P It bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...  I know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am.  Any of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me.
4	UnReZgxPY36ec7xdMVTmhg	The thin crust pizza's were good, would liked to have more veggies on the vegetarian though. The buffalo chicken wings didn't come with any celery, but at least they were cooked well. A little pricey though. Friendly and clean atmosphere. The server was very attentive. Will go back again.
4	4VLLWokzfqEf5touWUbhqw	We have been staying very near to this place for the past 5 months... How many times we thought of trying this one out.. Finally we did :) .. Food was pretty good.. Chicken parm was awesome ( highly recommended )... However there were very few servers around and the service was'nt great either.. Food was pretty good though.. I am a fan of this place :)
4	4j59WSXB4RvvgjwlpjzTnA	The people working were really nice and our food was good but could have been more evenly distributed, one side of the sandwich was really loaded with everything then the other side was just bread? But was still a good half sandwich.
4	6RNQJpEXFN7tU7T0RSmqTQ	Everything is wiped down very nice.  Staff behaves very well in the back kitchen, by keeping their back kitchen conversations to a low level without any inappropriate words/conversations that one might pick up in every other.  Plenty of selections. Everything was well made. the produce looked fresh, and everything actually looked like the freggin picture. lol
4	Pfu3Tom9n9AunQ2D9ytpPw	My journey for delicious Mexican food has finally ended here at Chevy's.  The  food definitely remind me of the great authentic food back in Houston, Texas. Even though it is quite a distance from where I am currently live, I will definitely make the drive to satisfy my cravings for Mexican food.  Our last visit at this place, there were 4 couples ahead of us, just waiting and waiting.  Seems like two of the couples waited for quite a while so they gave up and left.  After 5 minutes though, we got a table.  Looked like they were shortage of staff.  But o well, one man's loss is another man's gain.  I got to eat the DELICIOUS Mexican food that I have been craving for!!!  Dinner for 2 1.) Chicken Corn Chowder-a very well balanced soup where one can taste both chicken and corn.  Those two flavors work so well together...OMG!!!  2.) Mixed Grill Plate-Beef Fajitas, Shrimp, and Chicken, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, refried beans, rice, and tortillas.  Oh wait, the best thing is the...TAMALITO :)       -TAMALITO-The most delicious thing ever.  Go to Chevy's you must try this awesome corn flour treat.  I ordered another one of this sweet corn tamalito for desser.  It is savory and kinda sweet. Quite honestly, i could have a bowl of these babies and call it dinner!!!!  This was more than enough for 2.  We pretty much stuffed ourselves so none will go to waste!  3.) mango lemonade-yummy yummy yum yum yummy.  I always order this drink.  Food and Service: 4 Stars.
2	vDlilEC1nxawtJqO174pOA	came here for dinner as part of my friend's bachelor party weekend a couple of weeks ago.  it took a little bit, but we got a sweet private table (enclosed by draperies) looking into the casino.  i knew going in to not expect very good "chinese" food.  i expected something like pf chang's.  so what did we get?  amazingly, nothing as good as pf chang's.  we ordered about 2 appetizers and 7 or 8 main courses, and for the life of me, i can't even remember what the heck we ate.  when i don't remember anything about the food, you gotta believe that this place is just ho-hum.  nothing truly bad about the food, but absolutely nothing memorable either.  so why no 3 stars?  service was incredibly sub-par.  okay, not just sub-par, it was just plain bad.  for a high end place, i'd have expected far superior service, but alas, it was not the case.  all in all, i would never venture here again of my own accord.
4	uMqDd6EWD7Uh1FqqpYMcPg	This is a great concept with a great view of the field.  We didn't sit here for the game, but instead went in to watch batting practice.  On top of that we just had beers.  Apparently, they sell tickets for the games at the restaurant and clear out the seats a little before game time.
2	MKOOx3TufyRL6oc0C1UA	This is not a gourmet restaurant, but it has a gourmet menu.  The cuts were tough and just weren't prepared well.  The steak was very inconsistent, as if it were not tenderized properly.  The pasta's were just boring.  The more I think about the place, the more upset I get because it was such a let down.  I thought going in, this would be Phoenix's salvation.  It did not rise above the rest, but slipped into mediocrity along with the rest of the Valley's overpriced fare.
4	zNVi1S3Nx6mm9EqsrA40A	It's a little out of the way for me, but it's always worth the drive. I always end up eating at Taco Bell, but I never know why I don't go to Dell Taco more often. The steak tacos are delicious and the crinkle fries are yummy, throw in a churro and you've got a great meal. Wish it was closer, but I'm never sorry I made the drive.
4	QkINoH3TRDdW93vhD1QrXw	I have been going to Arthur's for years, since I worked at South Park.  The food has always been consistently good.  One of the best grilled cheese around, with bacon and tomato.  I was not disappointed today, with the grilled cheese.  Another good option is the hot turkey grinder.
2	TYDklfRg8r7Pa6wvADMvg	Well just your average pub but, the food was decent and I like that they have more than one type of frie there. The service was sooo slow though. I am unsure why they have such bad and lost help, they must be hiring friends and family because this town has a lot of unemployed people that can do a lot better.
2	uPgaq0rV9nIXhzeZy1w0NA	Definitely not the cleanest Denny's I've ever eaten at.  Rather than being greeted when I walk in like I experience at most Denny's I was pretty much ignored for 5 minutes.  We were finally shown to a table and ignored again for awhile.   Ignored again for awhile until they remembered to ask us if we'd like something to drink.  Are you getting the picture? Very slow service here?   The food and service was very below average for Denny's .
2	QuupjOmEXFPu4V79QneWsA	I came Here for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place, I was .... Starters food is nothing outta the ordinary,,one funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON! And no not turkey bacon... So clearly lil off there...  Other then that we order common breakfast .. Which was ok... I had the western omelette with turkey sausage ... The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge ... Lil less On that lil more on the egg,,.. Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton ... Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation ...
2	8dX4GhQCAsOmVTCNw3KwDg	For fast food I like KFC in general (grilled chicken). This location for some time now seems to hire the most inept of retards. I'm not sure why it takes twice as long to be served here and why the orders almost always seem to be missing an item. I've ventured inside a time or two and it must be the dirtiest KFC in Arizona. Dammit I want a real KFC near my house!
2	O7oRTCTpzFhFidNRrfYlyA	As Quiznos has slid closer and closer to irrelevancy, the range of quality of the food from store to store has never varied more. This is one of the worst - they don't cook the chicken the same way, and the only lettuce they keep in stock is iceberg. Due to the lack of food options in Ahwatukee, however, I'm the closest thing this place has to a regular (it's always empty). Sigh.
2	zMcYaqPwY05vWkad9hXwvA	We "were" very excited to see Anzio's had relocated to the corner of McDowell and Power, next to D'Vine. Thought we'd give it a try being it had been a while. Service was pretty decent (however, TOO many bussers hanging around in the dining room doing nothing).  I ordered the Anzio's Cosmo. I was pretty good. Got a basket with 4 slices of bread (slices of bread? Really? Breadsmith is right next door! How about some rolls, or focaccia, or artisan cheese bread) to hold us over while we waited for dinner. Hubbie got the spaghetti and meatballs with marinana. Meatballs didn't taste like they were made on site. He liked the marinara though. I ordered the Pasta Mediterranean. The dish was weak and lacked flavor. It had lots of cherry tomatoes, olives (which were supposedly kalamata but didn't taste like it) and I found a small chunk of artichoke. It needed some garlic and/or capers. Something to give it a kick! It was edible, but not memorable (except that I'll remember not to order it if I return).  Decided to split a dessert and ordered the tiramisu ~ VERY good!  Best part of the meal.  I hope the new owner/owners at Anzio's read these reviews and make improvements because I'd really like to see them succeed. Unfortunately, it will be a while before I return.
2	SaUv88oy7QBHmu2X6pXwQg	So we have friends who love this place and decided to check it out.  Check in was quick. The girl who took our order was in training and from what I saw she was pretty new. Hubby tried to order the chicken stir-fry without veggies and we should've known then the food wasn't going to be very good.  The cashier told us it all comes together and cannot be separated so he got the grilled chicken breast and a side of rice.  It was ok. I ordered the flounder and shrimp platter with a fresh fruit cup and vegetable soup.  The shrimp was pretty good.  LOVED the hushpuppies.  Everything else was definitely not good.  The fruit was old and actually rotten looking.  Returned it and got the steamed veggies but they tasted gross and the soup tasted like it was out of a cheap can..not even a Campbell's can.  Needless to say we will not be back anytime soon.
4	vv60GLiHobl9Bu7aR9mWw	Went for lunch after reading the reviews on here.  I wasn't as amazed as most people I guess but the food was pretty good.  I started out with a Montana Margarita which was a margarita with huckleberries in it and huckleberry flavoring.  It was very good and very strong which I was happy about.  The chips and salsa came and the hot salsa was pretty good.  I ordered the crab and shrimp enchiladas and people weren't kidding about the portion size.  I barely got 2/3's of it down before I felt my stomach stretching in pain.  I was very happy that the rice and beans were actually edible not just there for taking up space.  Most places I have been to lately the rice and beans were just not edible.  The location was very nice and clean inside and had a tv with football on in the bar area.  The outdoor seating area looked very nice and the menu was full of stuff I wanted to come back for.  Especially the banana nut flan.
4	Cv8HpymUnqKZd6WpHp2Q	Inexpensive pizza!   There are other pizza places in town that serve up better pizza but not for the price. They almost always have a great special going. they are one of the only places in town that actually slice meatballs for your "meatball" pizza. Too often when i order a meatball pie it is just ground beef. It's rare that I get it delivered since they are so close to me. Pizza is ready in less than 15 minutes and still hot when you get it home.   Call them for your Friday night pizza! I do.
4	9cyCE2MvCJXrsGzGUpwpwQ	It was hard for me to rate this place. I am not really a good judge of this style of food. However service, entertainment, prices are great. The food was good but a sauces were just a bit to heavy and salty for my taste. I would rate it better than OK but I am not really a fan.
2	FdezIgJ32La8nlRNwx1fA	"Meh.  I've experience better."   I find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the "like" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on "virgin" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh.
4	0m1YXNQpZWT6noxMze9S2Q	I wish there was actually a Hardee's in the Chicago city limits, but I survive because of the many other Chicago eateries.   Hardee's is one of the places I go to when I head down south from Chicago. The meals are big, but I always like having some leftover for another meal. This Hardee's always has nice staff well whenever I have been there.
2	oECVNDWoI3sGhcEw5OZ9Q	My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning.
4	HvlgQWoZWXa0ourZsX3daA	Pretty decent food here, reminded me of Chipotle a little. Too many onions and green peppers in the burrito I ordered, but I liked the freshness of everything, as well as the outdoor seating. They need more umbrellas or shade, as there was not enough seating outside for other customers that also didn't want to eat in direct sunlight.
4	JP9r6kBfyPcdxQ6eERcg	Brunch!  OK, first, we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes.  As a daughter of Irish stock, I thought I was pretty much over any potato-creation.  Wrong.  These were baked to perfection (crispy skin, soft middles) and impeccably seasoned.  I ate every last morsel.  Seriously, I love when things look so simple (they are just cut-up potatoes!) are so unreasonably delicious.  Secondly, just about any option could be made vegetarian.  Bonus points for that, Maria!  Portions were enormous... but we all cleaned our plates... so yeah, it was all very good (or we are all brunch-piggies, your pick).  Our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well.  I treated my two friends (yeah, I'm a high roller) without cringing at the check.
4	R6abEYE0cPeS9nxd9hdAw	I went for Happy Hour in the bar and was very pleased.  There is a great selection of drinks and food all for very reasonable prices.  I enjoyed orange slice martinis and shared several appetizers with friends.  The food portions were large and all very tasty.  The lounge has a great  cozy atmosphere with just the right amount of lighting.  Our service was very good and they were attentive to our needs.  Just make sure you get there early because it does get crowded especially in the hot summer months when it's too warm to sit outside even with the misters.
4	lq4CwTS6XeV5gd6ffnldA	My family and I love this place - fantastic sushi at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is a little funky - but in a wierd way it works. We love their volcano roll - which a special but is quite frequently on the board.  A lot of people don't know about it because it's tucked away into a corner (next to Chompie's) - but for that reason it makes it seem more like a hidden gem. It's never over crowded (I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table) and the service is always great.
2	EPd6ZnAY0ilvHg39yKyFA	What is different about this Subway?  1. Very small space, forget finding a table at lunch time. Lines out out the door.  2. I think they have new owners or managers, and that may not be a good thing. They used to be generous with toppings and sauces (not overly generous, but in line with other Subways). Now they are VERY stingy... very little sauce, small amounts of all toppings, etc. Seriously, I think my "sandwich artist" was counting black olives.  3. Stingy with the meat. I typically get the sweet onion chicken, and they now make darn sure when portioning the chicken they don't allow one small piece to stock out of the already small scoop. My last sub did not have more than 6 medium-small sized pieces of chicken. I think the other subs with pre-portioned meat are fine.  I like subway, but look for different location (about 3 mi. south).
4	X44jWXSFFFtXJM6sA47rA	Great casual Mexican restaurant. Large dining rooms, and nice comfortable  tables too.  The service was brisk, the food was above average (which means a lot here in Arizona), and the low prices were a bonus. I had the Tostada and Taco and was thoroughly satisfied. The chips and Salsa were good too - though the salsa could have used a little more heat.  I have not tried any other restaurants in Wikenburg yet, but I will definitely try this one again.
4	sCGKoouAfzQ4fx0m0DL5A	Recently, I came here for a conference.  The hosting organization did a superb job by selecting this awesome hotel!  This hotel is conveniently located in the midst of restaurants, stores, and whatnots.  There's an awesome pond in the back with even more restaurants.  The hotel itself is spacious with ample space for exhibits, registration, and socialization.  The rooms for workshops were impressive, allowing a large number of participants to attend.    The room was nice and decent.  Nothing fancy.  The beds were a little too soft for my liking.  Throughout the night, I just could not sleep.  Tossed and turned.  Folded pillows in half.    The staff were friendly and helpful.    I'll be back next summer as another hosting organization will have a conference there!
2	gB7PN6F28G7uON0JEICQ	I call this pizza "dining on a budget" pizza. Meaning when you are broke and close to payday...and you have nothing to eat..   It doesn't compare to dominos or pizza hut or even papa johns...but if you are hungry...you will eat almost anything.  Its always packed for the special $5 Hot and Ready Pizza...but this wouldn't be my first choice for pizza.
4	r91qcKWUuZLT8xadLAm5g	After receiving multiple recommendations for this place, I decided to give it a shot. But upon reading the recent negative reviews, I became nervous. They all had the common theme of: "used to be great, went downhill, too expensive, try Jimmy Wan's." In spite of all that, I called ahead about 20 minutes prior to arrival on a Saturday night to get a table for 6, including two high chairs. We were seated promptly. The place wasn't packed but it was far from dead. Our drink orders were taken and fulfilled and refilled lickety split. We were somewhat indecisive about our entrees, but our appetizers got put in and brought out in a very well-timed fashion.   Between the four adults, we ordered two egg rolls, crab rangoon (6) and a vegetable roll. All were very good. The sushi was so good that we ordered another to share. In spite of ordering it last second, it still came out before our hot entrees, which were general tso's chicken and sesame beef. I rate both of these high. Chicken was crispy, not overly sweet or greasy with just a touch of spiciness. Sesame new was new to me but i had a bite and liked it  Prices were $13-$17 for the entrees. Some of the chef's specials could get pricey, but there are big ticket items at every sit down restaurant.   As for the service, it was courteous, prompt and, best of all, patient when it came to wrangling our hyperactive baby. The server was conscientious about keeping plates and other implements away from our grabby baby and didn't give us dirty looks for the puffs that littered the floor beneath his high chair (note: we tried to pick up as many as we could before we left). I think at our somewhat unfocused pace, we ended up being there for over an hour and we never felt rushed. Nor did we need to flag anyone down for service.  My only regret is that I didn't try something more adventurous. On my way to the bathroom, I noticed a hot pot, some dumpling soup, some kind of dish that sizzled like crazy as they brought it out and some sort of sweet, sort of rice wine-y smell that made me wish I had taken advantage of their liquor license.I also got a good glimpse at their sushi bar, which looked quite nice with all of the fresh fish on display.   At any rate, I would most definitely come back here. It deserves its $$ rating here, but it's no more expensive than going to China Palace in Shadyside (one of my favorites).
4	TxJG48OKBfZfCDdPEUbcvw	Love it!  A local bar/restaurant with lots of character. You know the kind - lots of interesting knick knacks on the walls, shelves, ceiling. Distinctive local western decor. Not fancy by any stretch of the imagination meaning you will not have to spend a lot of money for food.  Speaking of food, the green chili is  about as good as it gets. I would return again and again just for the green chili.  Menu has variety ranging from Mexican food (fabulous!) to American (Burgers, steak, seafood - Cod).  Complimentary chips and salsa - excellent . You'll find tourists and locals eating side-by-side (95% local, 5% tourists :-). A large bar area with a few TV's and a dozen or so bar stools and 5-6 dinner tables and a back room just for dining with a mix of tables and booths. Fine for families.
2	lErdXB1giMIdwl8pofdhQ	Ok, now i have to say I am a big Arby's fan.  Love this place normally just not this particular location.  The drive thru line is long.  Staff isn't exactly friendly and for some odd reason the food just tastes bland.   I tried to get through the drive thru in the short amount of time I had for lunch and it was funny to watch the Del Taco next doors line move faster with more people in it than this Arby's.
2	X7WuTOJolyPJjojixZSZw	What can I say... if I were Don and owned this place, I would likely be a little crabby too.  Shouldn't have been too surprised though considering this is a bar in a strip-mall, but I had high hopes since it's across from fancy-schmancy Val Vista Lakes.  I like dive bars, don't get me wrong, but this place was just kind of weird.  We walked in and it felt like a big empty room... which it really was actually.  I'm not sure if it's a dance floor at night perhaps?  But it was just a strange feeling and layout.   The place was dead, I could count the number of people in there on 1 hand (granted it was like 5pm on a Thursday, but hello... happy hour anyone?) and it was also super quiet and awkward (hello, MUSIC anyone?).  We had one drink and left.  Not the worst dive bar I've been to, but certainly not even close to being the best.
2	ndLJgrpDl2E7DDBZYY6Cdw	Ugh. How frustrating is it to have to repeat yourself several times to get them to understand what you're ordering? ...And then they still don't get it right? This has happened to me 2 of 2 trips there (and I won't be back). My advice: train some active listening skills.
2	c9MrNagwCAvPCVp4u41w	For the same amount of coin, I'd take some ghetto Chinese over a bowl at Samurai Sam's.  This is obviously healthier than Chinese, there's no doubt. The Sumo Bowl ($10!) I ordered had better quality meats and vegetables than you'd find at a Chinese take out. Tasty, however, it was not.  The ingredients were not seasoned enough for my tastes, and I did all I could to add some flavor. I added some soy sauce, Japanese red pepper and salt & pepper. Adding these after cooking proved pointless and I kind of suffered through the meal instead of enjoying it.   Perhaps there's some sauce that I forgot to ask for, which will render the Sumo Bowl less healthy in exchange for deliciousness?
2	l0d8OEdZuImKwmXlXwMtw	My third time getting take-out from there and getting screwed on the guac I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager and was offered a free appetizer next time I came in. Nonsense... what incentive is that... to spend more money someplace that has already screwed me 3 times. The food s good... but there is better out there in this town that delivers and gets their orders correct every time. Thought I'd give them another chance and they BLEW it. How hard can it be to put a side of guac in a bag when you're not even busy? C'mon!?!
4	Sf4l9tG6J9gGN5H5tz9DHg	I've been to other Chipotles and was surprised when this location wouldn't let me get rice on my salad.    I don't get it - everything is the same price so it seems like you should be able to get all options with your salad.    Every other Chipotle lets me get rice on my salad.
2	InoMVkiv4hRT33QNcVpmhg	Don't bother.   We were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place, with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).  They boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh, and the grocery store wine was way over priced.  Boo!
2	J9dKNnWrt7fCHF0dds7BQ	A poor version of Cheesecake Factory (and I don't like Cheesecake Factory - big menu with lots of stuff from all persuasions, none of it rendered well - this place is similar but rendered even less well.)  Don't waste your time.
2	f0iMiDFcJeb7crrSgIlg	The food was great. But the service was bad. We had to wait 30 min for our food. And when we got it, Guadalupe behind the counter wanted to charge 25 cents per sauce packet. After telling her we waited a long time for our food and we shouldn't have to pay for condiments, the manager told her just give it to them. This place was really slow and filled with waiting customers.  A 30 min wait for an 8 piece meal is not cool.
2	rzAwzMc2sxXkon2SI7PCg	I've yet to have a truly bad experience here, but the food takes an Eternity, the staff seem to hate working there and frequently forget to come back to the table. we live right by this denny's, and yet when we do our denny's get-togethers (unlimited pancakes are one of the few pluses.) We would much rather drive the extra few miles to the one on country club and southern.
4	6cEPSracaNdofDdBK77tzA	For a movie place, the food is pretty good, even for vegetarians! They even mix a decent drink. Now, if I could only remember what I had and liked...   Ironically, it's the popcorn that we're always tempted to order but never end up too fond of.
4	ovw4MxpVnF4fm6SdcwQOdQ	We decided to give the restaurant many more shots after the last horrible experience and each one has been better then the last. We just sit at the bar now and the service is great. The Saturday night bartender is awesome and the food is many steps above that first experience.
2	6GVJbBm0eLtz93wCnArsw	Maybe I went at a bad time or on a bad night, but I couldn't wait to ditch the place for something more enticing. The crowd was too old, the music wasn't getting any reaction (meaning no dancing), and I can't believe this place is members only... I would never pay. If you like a stiff, older crowd then check it out :)
2	3amqN8DZOBvhcLXDOsUXHw	I have had good pizza here in the past so I thought I would try their pasta. I ordered pasta with meat sauce. First of all, the server never said there was a $1.00 extra charge for the meat sauce nor did she say there was a .50 cent additional charge for blue cheese on the salad. I questioned the bill but she said the prices were correct. No receipt for me to look at. I got the order to go and when I got home and opened the pasts, there was a layer of sauce on top and underneath was a layer of ground meat sprinkled over the past. The meat wasn't mixed into the sauce and was very bland hamburger meat. Anytime I have ordered meat sauce, the meat is cooked in the sauce. In my opinion, this wasn't meat sauce. After I got home, I looked on the menu and there I found the meat sauce and blue cheese were extra. Fine print and never told up front about the extra charge. Never going again. There are better places in the valley for pasta with REAL meat sauce, not bland hamburger crumbles over pasta with marinara sauce on top.
4	ayRSJTebZFq4rfBPjVCp7A	i really like this place. i go here maybe once a week, i really like their sandwiches. as its the only thing ive had from here, ill stick to them.  its fast, no wait, and i get my food with a smile. considering i only paid ten bucks, i like the joint.
4	1MOdKR7Bxqyef1PTNogQA	Every great once in a while I'll have a craving for a triple burger from Wendy's. This hasn't resulted in a heart attack yet, so I'll try and keep this craving to once or twice a year. But, I have to say, this is the best fast food burger out there, and although I wouldn't want you to make a habit of eating like this, I do recommend it... Once or twice a year!
2	QCj9HWf6Kijx1yZ7C5JcVA	Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  It was OK. Not spectacular. We had the chicken chow mein lunch special. Prices are good.  I found it odd that this particular lunch special comes with a side of egg foo yung.  I'd prefer almost anything but that - considering the egg foo yung wasn't at all like others I've had. But an egg roll, chicken wing or finger or boneless ribs make much better side items. And the amount of rice you get was pitiful!  One small scoop the size of an ice cream scoop.  Rice is the filler - there should have been more of it.  The chow Mein tasted ok - it wasn't bad or anything.  We've just had better.
2	sdXkh7erYUnwdfkIk610eQ	The first time or two that I came here I thought it was great. But in the past year or more, I haven't had one good experience.  The food has only been of moderate quality, yet the prices are that of a higher level restaurant. And the service has been horrendous. The last time I was there, our server, after barely attending to us when we were his only table, up and left near the end of our meal. We watched him walk right out the door and drive away without saying anything to us. After about 10 minutes, I grabbed my coat and was ready to walk out. Then the manager finally came over with our bill. It wasn't until after I paid and we were leaving did she tell us that she sent him to their other location.  To abandon your tables without even explaining anything to them is absurd. For management to condone it is even worse. Maybe they don't understand that they need customers to stay in business.  Whatever the case, I won't be wasting my time or money here again.
2	TeeupWWNm3BfDe6uxoR2A	I've gone to Max's twice. They have decent draft specials, but not much else. The bartenders seemed bored, no real energy in the place. I suppose if you like to gamble or like sports it would be ok. They have lots of flat screen tv and gambling type machines, etc.. Not much of a crowd though. Bleh atmosphere. More of a local place to meet 1 friend for a beer once, than a hangout kinda place for a regular meetup.
2	wqvQhzEAar0Lvqbgzxf5w	The food is good at this place, but for drive-through orders, I have been shorted on my order about 30-40% of the time.  If you go there, double-check your order regardless of how long it takes.  It'll be correct on the screen, but wrong in the bag, and usually missing something.  On a positive note, when I indicated I had a problem on their online survey, i got immediate and meaningful response from management.  However, the problem just occurred again today.  Management has more work to do.
4	8qD0ZdFfXORDus3V6HeEQ	I went to Legends Bar & Grill with my family, which included my 4 yr. old grandson. Everyone really liked their meal but the food took a long time to come out. That really is my only complaint. Otherwise we all thought the flavor, quantity and presentation of our lunch was really good and we especially appreciated our waitress. She was attentive and so sweet - she brought my grandson 5 candied cherries from the bar instead of the 1 that we asked for (no, we didn't let him eat them all - just 2). We all felt full and happy when we left!
2	WwJ0vH89ie6y8lCCvudkg	This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.
2	dnDhFq60I0p6vJ1sHPN8Q	Ok... i'm not getting the hype.  The problem I had was that with everything good, came something bad.   - Menu: huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food.  The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table. -Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions. -Portions:  We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza!  The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week).  On the other hand, we also got the "zany zitti" which was... well pathetic.  Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have???  The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box. -Flavors: Not bad, but not special.  not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting.  All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night.
4	LBc54CT7jghJbGSVPwxDCA	the food was well prepared, the service was nice. Pros. Location, food flavors, servers.  Cons. THe service was a little slow.  SInce the original reivew of this place I have returned and found that I like this place more each time I do. The Food has stayed the same, well prepared, tastey. The service is slow, however I have since learned that this place does something special, they employ the challenged anad give them an opportunity that others may not. The staff is always VERY friendly. I will continue to return there.
4	EM9Rt1MynluXOE4FouqAw	Yes, it's a chain.  Is it top of the line?  No.  But the quality has greatly improved over the years and the service as well.  They handle groups well.  This place is always on the list for my office to have lunch.  I recommend it.
4	f7f8nyXbfqrhm4N1jfuQ	Love the breakfast sandwiches, they are large, filling and delicious.  The chicken salad sandwich is also great and my dogs love the doggie bagel treats.  The staff is friendly and the new set up gets you in and out much more quickly.  The only reason that I can't give them that 5th star is that they took away the call ahead ordering which used to be my Sunday routine.  When you are in a hurry the ability to call ahead and run in and get your breakfast was a lifesaver! But since they won't take phone orders anymore I have found myself going to other places that will.
2	BtCj4gfKejQuTboIyoWAg	This location is inside of Arrowhead mall in the food court & I'm only rating them based on my BREAKFAST visit.   I met a friend there for the previously mentioned breakfast, lol, & found myself in a heaping line. Turns out the mall opens early & there are 'walking clubs' that gather there. After all that walking they all get in line for coffee it seems, lol.   The coffee was just ehhh. Nothing special. No lattes. I was REALLY hoping to get their mandarin muffins, which happen to be a little piece of heaven, but the lady informed me they were all out... I can not begin to describe my disappointment as I sat at a cold jiggly table in the mall food court surrounded by people in jogging suites with a plain cup of coffee & a zucchini muffin (which wasn't bad, but wasn't great).   Ce la vie! Sometimes you get the mandarin muffin & sometimes the walking club eats them all :)
2	gGU595EIzbNQcU0aJwjnPQ	I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant.  It's much better on paper than in actuality.  It sounds nice to eat overlooking the Venetian canal, but like the entire hotel, it's really quite bothersome hearing the voices of countless tourists echoing off the high ceilings.  The service is somewhat slow, and the quality of the food simply doesn't justify the price.  I have had better Italian food at Bucca di Beppo!   Gnocchi with Lamb Ragout--tastes like glorified Chef Boyardee Calamari--cold, and pretty rubbery Cod appetizer over polenta--too salty, uninspired, and somewhat bland Salad with pears, blue cheese, arugula & pomegranite dressing--couldn't taste the pomegranite, just tasted a little oily.  Pears were kinda mushy too. I have been to Il Forniao, and this is markedly worse. The restaurant next door--Il Postrio-- is yards better (granted, it's also more expensive).
4	8anjre6ovMyMP04XzZ5E1w	Chinese delivery in south Phoenix, you betcha! Good food, ample portions, quick efficent delivery - my kind of place. I ordered the seasame chicken and potstickers, both were excellent and delivered while still piping hot.
2	Vci6P2fSBTwSiPf5DaEA	I used to spend a lot of time eating drive thru. We are talking 3 times a day, 7 days a week. During that three years, I ate here at least 4 times a week, between breakfast, lunch and dinner. About 10 months ago I stopped eating fast-food all together, including McDonald's. At that time, the level of service that this particular McDonald's provided was on a slow decline. It started when I made the shift from double quarter pounders to grilled chicken salads. frequently, hell almost every time, I would not get utensils in my bag. So, I started asking at the speaker and at each window for utensils. Every time, I would get down the road, be rummaging through my bag, only to find that again I had no fork. My troubles did not stop there. Twice I got a salad, only to find that I could not eat it because the chicken was under cooked. If you know anything about working at McDonald's like I do (I worked my first job for 4 years at a McDonald's in KY), then you know it is hard to under cook grilled chicken. It is almost something you have to do deliberately. None the less, I am patient, so I did not complain. Periodically towards the end of my fast-food stent, the service level was going in the you know whatter. They had hired some 'new recruits' who were obviously to young and cool to care about the customers that they serve. I got full flavor of the chips on their shoulders every time i drove through. I knew that I was coming to the end of my fast food stage, so I just let it go and stopped eating fast food. Now, three days ago my brothers (who i live with), wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I wound up getting it for them, though I was not getting any myself, cause I'm just that kinda guy. I go through drive thru, like always, and I can't believe it. Not only did I wait at the speaker for almost 3 minutes before anyone picked up, while there were no cars in front of me, but when I got around to pay, there was nobody at EITHER window. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally after another 4 minutes, someone came to the second window scolding me for not stopping at the first window (which for the record I did stop for about 2 minutes). They were obviously having a bad day, and for whatever reason decided to take it out on yours truly. But that is not all. I finally get the food, make the short 2 minute trip home, get in the house, give my brothers the food, start telling them the horror story of our once favorite burger joint, and they stop me. They stop me to tell me that the food was so cold that they could not eat it. We wound up having spaghetti because it was just not eatable. Fail. I waited, hoping that I would just get over it, like I always to, but my voice has to be heard. This is simply outrageous. To think that in 10 short months, a restaurant can go from a family favorite to the worst place in the area is just unsatisfactory. Fail
2	ERTuYq8w4iq0CkHqE1A1w	Dining here was a poor experience for me.  Everything at this MC was downsized compared to other branches I have visited in the past, from the tiny dining room, the menu that lacked a few notable dishes I loved, and even the mean size of the pie serving!  They also lacked the fresh and awesome salad bar of other MC locations that I told my husband about to convince him we should go there!  (totally ruining my credibility in restaurant choosing!)  Service was also sad - a unfriendly server who didn't take care of us at all.  I wish I could rewind the evening and make a different choice.
4	DvtgmZemb8KHkps1LQTvcA	Great steak.  I ordered the porterhouse cooked medium and it certainly did not disappoint.  The cesar salad was nothing special.  The lobster bisque was outstanding.  Service was about what I expected.  They go out of the way to meet your every need.  Personally, I don't really like that kind of over the top service, but I know this is how these places roll, so I can put up with it.
4	gJLdzcNkvW34WYN9Vo8rCA	The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options.
2	omDC4mSNV9nuHnR1oTV5RQ	only come here if you are very desperate for something that distantly resembles a philly cheesesteak.  my girlfriend lives in philly and trust me, when I go there.  I have two a day everyday until I leave.  geri's got nothin on the city of brotherly love.  They do have some good mozarella sticks tho.
4	2Zv68qB2D1sjU2i3eufIFA	Been here many times for lunch as I work really close by. Every time I am there, they always greet me by name and even remember my usual order. The food is always top shelf and well prepared. All food is made to order, which ensures me that I get my food steaming hot just the way I like it. I would pay more if they offered footlong subs, which sadly they don't. It would also be plus if they sold french fries. Overall great place to eat.
2	JGm5bOq7Et8EISPoBvyPrA	Update - I had to reduce it to 2 stars.  I would never voluntarily go here and that is a pretty good test for me.  I would return to most of my three star reviews.  I have had a mental debate whether to give this place two stars or three.  For fear of getting flamed, I bumped up my 2.5 to 3.  I guess the main thing is that I just don't get this place.  We went for the early bird service at 5pm because we had a big group and it was tough to find parking.  People were already flowing out the front door waiting for tables.  My in-laws think Tia's has the best food, but my inclination is that Mesa just needs some more restaurants.  The chips are good and the salsa is average.  I don't really like it when salsa tastes like enchilada sauce and this is borderline.  I have been here 3 or 4 times and the only time I thought my meal was good to very good was the time I ordered fish tacos even though I usually do not like fruit in my Mexican food.  Due to the fact that everyone seems to love the food, I keep trying new things but am usually sorely disappointed.  This time, I had average tortilla soup and an average mini shrimp quesadilla (which was served open faced, unlike most quesadillas and sweet).  I guess I will stick to the fish tacos or try Andrew's suggestion of carne asada next time the in-laws want to hit up Tia Rosas.
2	MHuxyaTxaWHH6jShHFflA	My husband went there for breakfast and had to go back 3 times because each time they got his order wrong. It's not hard to read the screen on an order. A few times I went there through the drive-thru the person could barely speak English, wow!!!!!!! I should have to speak another language other than English just to get my food order across and get it correct the first time.
4	qw0DmmecjOcySUwT4ukpuw	Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02. The skirmish began when the then named Bazookie was placed on the dinner table. The Bazookie as describe by the menu is "a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream." Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD.   I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???
4	KTJb8mxbVmIpn1rUUVwZA	Blue features mediterranean style food and offers some unique options that I've not had before. The menu is pricey. Beautiful decor with a nice bar and jazz band playing. The dining room is very nice and feels like it should be pricey.  We've had great service every time we've been. The wait staff is helpful, knows the menu very well and has had some solid recommendations. The downside to Blue is that the food doesn't necessarily live up to the surroundings and the prices. I had the kobe beef on one occasion, which was very pricey, and found it to be absolutely awful. I've tried other more unique dishes like their Lamb Tagine which is slow cooked from 5am in the morning until served. I expected lots of great flavors and it was simply okay. My friend enjoyed the wild boar very much. My wife was very happy with the salmon. So the place can be great, it just depends on if you hit the right entree. We'll keep it on the list and hopefully they'll be more consistent.
2	niaNODkquUqs4xE92IPlA	Hubby had the fish with pecans, and LOVED it. I, on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp Po Boy.  Big ole piece of bread, 8 shrimp set on the bread to try to cover space (it doesn't), smidge of lettuce (not necessarily a bad thing), and mushy disgusting tomatoes.  Take a bite, and all you taste is bread.  Never again.
2	KeiNuKyPZWbPDlu3JDMAg	Light on atmosphere, serious about service.  Michael's is a paradoxical mismatch of high and low end dining.    Let me give you the good news first:  Incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and attentive staff.  Large menu with lots of tasty choices.  Generous, well prepared portions and reasonable value.  Healthy options and some imaginatively indulgent ones (Crispy bacon wrapped liver anyone?)  Now the bad: Ambiance; we were the only one's in the non smoking section, which was hit with 2nd hand smoke wafting over from the lounge side.  Their was an office attached to our dining area, only separated by fabric hanging down from the ceiling so we heard lots of loud business phone calls.  The kitchen was also extremely loud, and even though we were sitting in the furthest possible point away from it, the banging and shouting emanating from it was distracting.  Last, there was a very bright fluorescent bulb affixed against a wall directly at the guest's eye level.  It was placed above a side table to help the staff write notes, but it was blinding to look directly at, which was unfortunate as it was uncovered and placed immediately in front of me.  Heavy on service and food, but light enough on overall atmosphere to still make for a sub-par experience.  If it was a casual pizza shop or deli I would expect the noise and look, but with $20-$30 entrees, Michael's creates higher expectations of a fine dining experience than they live up to.
4	IYYSFkNiLDjvRpNBIZTSg	Service is unusually good here.  My server continued to work even after spraining something in her leg - talk about above and beyond.  When she was eventually forced to discontinue, another person immediately stepped in her place.  Was this Mimis' staff or the Lakers in disguise?  Their "price fixed" deal makes it all the better.  $14 for salad, ravioli, sundae, and a soft drink.  Sweet!
4	nMjZnqzbh6nkkYA3ycVXEA	delicious bagels and cream cheese. this place always hits the spot. it does get crowded during certain hours, mostly on weekends. They have the best bagles and cream cheese. Around Halloween/Thanksgiving they have pumpkin bagels and pumpkin cream cheese and they are yummy! I also enjoy their veggie sandwich and roast beef sandwich.
2	kanIOnNu2aisx9sIocMuSg	5 stars for the amazing customer service up front. I come here all the time and have never had a bad experience. Unfortunately, I'm waiting for my wings (totally fine with the wait) and all I hear from the back is an outrageous amount of profanity coming from a worker. I hear racial slurs and f-bombs being dropped every other word. I'm sorry, but that is extremely unprofessional. Unfortunately, it's not everyone else's fault that works here that she's such a bad worker. They at least tried to calm her, but she still went on for quite some time. I hope she gets some kind of punishment because at least two families had children present.
4	7Ni3IZ0fcC1oUsaeyhIo7A	the only thing worth getting here is the blueberry pancakes. They have an amazing blueberry compote on top with whipped cream, and it is delicious!. Everything else on the menu is ok, but the blueberry pancakes are the best. I've only been here for breakfast, so I can't really say about lunch or dinner.
4	bml3qYNZ6amWqo7Sol4aqA	Torture, as defined by Webster is the act of deliberately inflicting pain, which is exactly what I did Saturday. With #19 molar in need of an immediate extraction, I came here anyway, throbbing tooth and all. Big mistake.   The pre-meal tortilla chips were difficult to resist, igniting nothing short of a masochistic dining event.  The menudo was white and bland as hell, but the tripe was perfectly cooked.  My wife's flauta's were crunchy enough to send me through the rafters with each torturous, but delicious bite.   The only thing I could wolf handily was her refried beans and some handmade flour tortillas which were too, too good.   I looked like Senator McCain after eating here, but it was worth it.
4	xKSJpDaCLsBnE4CZuhe28g	I have been going to this Pizza Hut for ten years, and am quite satisfied overall.  They are especially good at deliveries and the pizza is always hot and perfectly cooked.  I think they try to make up for not honoring coupons, and because they charge more than the competition, they have to be good to stay in business.  So if we really want a good pizza, this is our first choice.     We always enjoy the buffet and have never left disappointed.  They even make special requests if you tell them when you first get there.  Ironically, the buffet price is excellent compared to actually ordering a whole pizza, which makes no sense to me.    They do seem to have a lot of turnover in employees, and the experience with service can vary greatly, anywhere between awful and terrific.  But it seems like they always try to make the customer happy.    I highly recommend this Pizza Hut, and plan on going there for the next ten years.
2	p15J6nrpoyilsZ79Cp2MJw	Great service, but the big lobster is a gimmick. To expensive. To much pressure to enjoy your meal. Big lobsters are not always the best. Stick to the buffet in the hotels, much better deal. $300 for three was ridiculous, mother father and child.
4	FZjHGOmIZfVpLQ9IVe3jBw	All I gotta say is....  To-go Salad a la carte 4 buck and some change...get a container that's seriously big enough for enough salad to last me lunch and dinner. Good salad toppings and what not. I stick to the breadsticks...the rest of the breads a little dry.
4	Edq2tPp5ze601fmObXPpOA	This is my favorite taco shop.  It has all the same menu items you'd expect at the prices you'd expect.  There are a million taco stands in the Phoenix area, but this one stands out to me.   Why you ask? #1 -  Their carne asada is the best I've ever had.  I'm a Phoenix native, therefore I've had A LOT of carne asada from taco stands in my life.  Hands down... the best! #2 - I've never gotten sick from this place.  I can list off numerous taco shops where I have. #3 - Kinda goes along with #2, the ingredients all seem to be fresh.  If you get sour cream, it's not curdly.  The bacon in the breakfast burritos are crispy, not chewy.  The tortillas taste like they make them there. #4 - You can call ahead and order to pick up. #5 - They have pollo asada dishes. Their food reminds me of meals I've had in Rocky Point.  Very delicious and affordable.
4	927ILbxr4zKuNc8PHwp8w	I loved this spot! We had such great service on a lazy Sunday night during Spring Training. HIt up the karaoke and LOTS of booze. So much fun. Seems like a good local spot and next time I'm in Spring Training, I will be going back.
2	Cxb7kENcZCdnZlqBn1Q	It's Ihop so there's not a lot too say. The service was nice but not the quickest, seemed a bit too relaxed and bored:) The food was ok. It's never perfect. It's not very hot when it arrives at your table, the bacon is too crisp, plain coffee... but it was ok for a breakfast. We just wanted to eat something before we drive up to the Grand Canyon.
4	iE9A5tAhPPU1sOQDbmV5qw	I must say that this place has some fine pancakes and waffles.  I first came here one Mother's Day when the place was packed and the service was awful.  I tried it again and was extremely satisfied.  The chocolate pancakes were simply outstanding.  The French toast as well.  The place normally has a wait, but is worth the patience.  The seating is substandard at best.  Not enough tables during the peak weekend hours, but the staff seems to function, nonetheless.  I am not sure why so many people give subpar reviews to this place.  The breakfast food is amongst the finest in the Valley.
4	mizZSxYKIJfHoue0RYFXA	Gardenia has to be one of the best values in Charlotte: good home-cooking and a lot of it, for a great price. Their grilled pork chops are juicy and well seasoned, meatloaf like mom's, perfect fried fish and 2 people can eat well for under $20, tip included. Not too shabby!
4	mAdpFFkbW4tWifttdT5kQ	Ah, good 'ol standby Village Inn, where else could I, a quasi-nut case get great food at such a late hour?   The manager misses us when we are not there to envelope the place with our gloominess. The service is really great and the food is always good. This is a much better choice over Denny's because they are cheap and the food portions are better than Denny's. Good place to wander over to after coming out of Shirt's 'n' Things.  I recommend the pie. It's free on Wednesdays
4	KbKGzojJfb2wXBFH4ZHY3A	Good food, good atmosphere and their pizza & wing special is fantastic.   Great for a night out that isn't that pricy...love this place.  As snowbirds, we like to find places that serve good food with reasonable prices.   Fairly clean & good atmosphere & staff is friendly & are very helpful.
4	TpiDp3W2XyYuqScmA2Zew	This is a great shop to get a fast sandwich. I come here when I have very little time to get lunch and I can get my sandwich right away, even if there is a line.  The folks are professional and after a couple times of going there they remember my order.  They are efficient at getting through the line.
4	JvhURTtlu9Q8kbVElK8Rg	It's not fancy, but solid, basic Italian food at good prices and the servers were very nice.  The meatballs that people rave about were just "ok" to us.   If not for the BYOB policy on wine, I would've give it a 3 star rating, but we took a really good Pinot that would've cost a ton at restaurant prices.  Get there early or be ready to wait on a weekend.   Also bring cash - no credit cards!
4	fca1Gzv7lSRa3hRAs6RueA	Back of haters, but I love Pei Wei.   Since I don't eat sentient beings, and only consume plant food. Pei Wei was very accommodating. I ordered the Lettuce Wraps with Tofu instead of Chicken. What can I say? They were delish and nutrish, and no I am not ashamed to admit that I eat here. The people that dog this place are so clueless, I'm sorry. What do you expect? This is Americanized Asian food. If you want authentic Asian food, then don't eat here and  check yelp first. Don't dog businesses because you're expecting authentic. Seriously!  LOL....  Another plus is they have free wi-fi. I love it.  :)
4	3PjXBFOfH5LTQf6HdRcw	I love Red Robin's all you can eat fries -- too bad I can only consume the ones that come with my meal.  I have good memories of Red Robin -- my college days when we'd go to the Red Robin out in Daly City and split burgers and gorge on the fries. When I left San Francisco for Las Vegas the last meal with my friends from the Bay Area was at Red Robin.  I'm glad that no matter where I have been there has been a Red Robin to eat at. I get moments where I must have their bacon cheeseburger. I fiend for their fries.  My only universal complaint about Red Robin is that it is freaking LOUD in there. I mean the kind of loud that is so obnoxious that I feel I have to take some aspirin. But what I do see everytime are happy smiling faces from their customers. They must be doing something right!  Food can be a bit salty because they put their seasoning on *everything* (I half expected it to be in my ice tea, too) - and their seasoning contains MSG. So being the fussy girl that I am, I always ask that absolutely zero seasoning be put on my food. Yea, call me a killer of fun, but would you rather spend time with me eating and laughing or watching me be carted off in an ambulance to the nearest emergency room?  What I also love about Red Robin is their strawberry shake...I haven't had one in a long time, but I know that if I even have one drop, I won't be able to stop. I will want strawberry shakes until I die. So I try to take a sip off of friends' shakes...which usually turns into a brain ache slug that leaves them with more whipped cream than shake.  :D  Oops, my bad!  I really do love their chocolate malts, too. That is such a wonderful dessert.  I've found service at this particular Red Robin to be extremely attentive and friendly.  I always leave with a smile on my face and an ache in my gut (a good ache, not a bad one!).
2	uii0DIMOIufkAypEjDvbw	TGIF is always my last resort kind of place. The food is meh...you get what you order and its obviously cooked by someone who's not a cook. The drinks are standard giving this place nothing special. Food quality below average to average. The service is slow and inacurrate. It never seems like they care about you giving service quality poor. The price is average. Not much to say about the price because it's mostly cheep, but so is the food. Value below average to average.  Over all there's not much to say about TGIF. Definitely not worth going out of your way for or visiting when Phoenix has so much to offer. My advice to TGIF...do something big and unique and train your staff.
2	xfrgFgDhtOeLXpQIyOwXg	Ok if you are looking for a quick fix of sushi / sashimi, but nothing to go out of your way for. Pleasant staff but a little ho-hum , some strange patrons !  If you want a good sushi bar go to Yasu on E.Cactus .
2	qHgyMGcQZMvwvjoB64gjHA	Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.  Unfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.  My mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.    I like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.
4	cd3ERcMwWupU84sUluty9w	Good pizza, good drinks, good bar tenders.   We had a everything pizza and several drinks. All of them hit the spot.   The pizza is a thick crust with tons of toppings and light sauce cooked perfectly, served while hot still.   (calzones looked good too)
4	qftbHPIkb1G7XfPXiRLqtw	Two words: Chicken Mango. There is nothing like it in any Indian restaurant I've been to before or since.   Other than that dish, Peoples is pretty typical of small Indian restaurants. The buffet is alright, the portions are of average size and the service is reasonably good.
4	Qllg2BHfv26m3UQqdNTAhg	Went to dinner here last night.  I loved the Quartino option for the wine for only a few dollars more!  The Lobster ravioli wasn't the best, but the dish my bf got was awesome, I just don't remember what it was called, but it was also a ravioli of some sort.  The bread was yummy, hot and soft, just how I like it!  And the waiter was prompt and polite.  I can't say one bad thing about this place except for the rude customers at the bar who were raising hell over not being able to split the cost of a SOUP between two checks.  The fact that they were being so loud, we knew every detail about their situation was a little annoying considering we had to put our own conversation on hold because of the disturbance.   But that's neither here nor there... and has no reflection on my opinion of the restaraunt.  And I'm definitely a Fan. ;)
4	i7MoMN2WO0vMcthwhvrTQ	This is not a sushi joint so don't go expecting sushi though they do serve some.  Nagasaki Grill is about as close to a Japanese Ramen/Udon/Soba shop as you'll find in Arizona.  The owners are friendly and they even have the summer seasonal cold Saimin noodle dishes I like.    My favorite dish is the Champon, it's a huge bowl of rich broth w/ ramen like noodles, napa cabage, and pork belly slices. It reminds me of my dads cooking.
4	ggQcBC9Fo4pw3IqO7oPwRQ	I love the food here. The gyro meat is very tasty. I have brought many new people with me to dine and all have been impressed. I do wish they would give you more tzatziki sauce. Also the service can be quite slow at times.
4	EeIsy0V9fZpt9n6FvDbNhw	After a number of visits I am upgrading SoHo to 4 stars - it's upscale bar food in a nice setting and one of the best options in the area around PNC Park.  The menu is large so I doubt much is all that fresh but SoHo serves standard bar appetizers as well as decent sandwiches and average burgers, plus even some entrees which generally seeem to be quite good.  They also offer a whole bunch of sides with your sandwich & burger rather than just automatically getting fries - gotta love the tater tots and even the mashed sweet potatoes are pretty good.  If you're in the area for a game or any reason, SoHo is a nice upscale option for food or a drink - and there are plenty of TV's for watching sports.  It's a good place to hang out.
2	8jtWZQT1COQ3n7RRIjmWuw	Usually stop by for a vanilla coke. Got a burger today, was more than half way done and bit into a hair.  About 4 inches long and black or dark brown. I'm a red head, so it was not mine. Plus it was imbedded in the cheese.  ICK. I was so grossed out I tossed everything left and took off. :(
2	x8d4OZU3uH3pgxWDIQGog	It's a shame, I was really looking forward try this restaurant ... We walked in and place seemed crowded... They were clearly understaffed...  here is how it went ... waiter #1 came gave us 1 special for the night and then asked what we wanted, besides water, by the time we look up he was already gone .. WTF  ... minus one star right there, we asked another guy walking around if we could order, he said he said he doesn't take the orders but he can try to help us with drinks( minus another star), luckily another waitress overheard and decided to come help us .. which was nice, she was helpful and gave us 4 specials for that night (I think her name was Jennifer - plus one star) .. She was kinda on top of everything and super peppy which was good, she forgot our balsamic vinegar and one of my pizza's but I didn't mind much because she was so damn nice ... the food kinda sucked .. the bruschetta had too much mozzarella .. the last time I checked, it was just a Parmesan or a hard cheese ..  the pasta was kinda bland, and didn't have enough salt... the pizza was extremely cheesy...  (minus one star) Everything was a bit pricey ... with the prices I would have expected the food to be superb .. save your time and go to Lombordino's ... I really wanted to  like this place I really did, but I think they need to change things up
4	YuvafAAXnvE9vukdsYm6Q	Best friend and I went to Salazar Brothers for lunch today; it is one of our fav lunch time places. I haven't been in awhile and am glad we chose this place today. I ordered the #20 which was a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, now I'm not a huge fan on refried beans, but today the beans were great! The burrito was packed with meat, guacamole & Pico de Gallo, very flavorful and yummy! Best friend ordered 2 asada tacos & cheese quesadilla with jalapenos. If you're a fan of really hot sauce that scorches your tongue then they might leave you lacking in the heat, but their red hot sauce is favorable and not tomato saucy like some places it's just missing the heat.    Great food for lunch at a reasonable price!
4	7DRmGrH14KoFAoj28kd8g	This is a great lunch place.  You can get a healthy, great-tasting, fresh burrito bowl that totally fills you up.  And I love the salsa bar...if you get bored with one you can get a different one next time...or mix and match.
2	ckLs3RY2B0jfMrYdjr6Bgg	During my 5 nights stay at Ritz,  I went to  Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning.  I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards.  I had to wait a while for someone to wait on.  It was not even busy.  For the next 4 days, I just walked across the street to Starbucks.
2	iVFXdqmHyBr9MRvV4PjOnA	I grew up in Madison and Sai-Bai Thong was the only Thai restaurant I'd ever been to until college.  Because of that I thought I hated Thai food.    It wasn't Thai food's fault.  It was Sai-Bai Thong's fault.
2	QoO8GWLHFVjwzsAQSaOw	Below average Chinese food. Chow mein was very greasy., sweet and sour pork was honestly just yucky. Their Mongolian beef was decent, but it's 5% beef with the rest being greens.  Only been here once and not going back.
4	RXlHVpW6Jp6IIe8jrYDXw	To all those who would score down a McDonalds because they serve McDonalds food, let's be fair-you're the one who decided to eat there.   The food is consistent with what you'd expect, the drive-thru is pretty quick, and the customer facing staff is as friendly as you could ask minimum wage employees to be.   Cons: drive-thru pattern and driveway access only from the rear makes access more difficult than it needs to be, the PlayLand could also be protected better from the elements. I don't think there is any way an adult can make it to the top to clean it properly, either.
2	UotW7C6QlsSK0YFefr8nbg	Outback isn't...bad...but what's the point? For a chain it's not bad, though. I'll consider going if friends want to. And for the record, I agree with the previous reviewer that the Bloomin Onion is just disappointing on all levels.   Maybe the ultimate problem is I never want a cheap steak. An expensive steak can be delicious, but if you're not going to go balls out for an excellent cut of meat and preparation, there are so many more interesting things you can do with that same steak (I'll take a steak huarache at Taqueria Guadelajara or a kebab at Shish Cafe any night of the week for less money).  Sometimes you just want something familiar, though, and if you're considering going to Outback you know what to expect.   But I might cry a little.
4	rel9Y1GZlnyhGnCD1NWA0g	My food was a little burnt on the underside when I first got it, but they were extremely apologetic, took it back, and then brought me back a fresh dish. The second one was perfect. It was a wonderful dinner with my family, and I'd like to go back someday.
4	NjsQT9aHi5emJhgP7TzDUQ	I have tried all three crusts and the traditional is the best by far. Good sauce, nice thicker crust, bubbly and lite. Tried the steak wedgie and it was delicious! The only thing I would recommend is asking them to go light on the lettuce. Way too much for my taste, but it's a pizza crust wrapped around the meat and veggies, with no sauce. They also make delicious fresh cut fries. The large is more thank enough for 2 people. I can barely finish the small by myself.  Big portions , good prices, quick pick up and delivery.
4	VAG2m0jP5Ds6jiXAPsE4A	Pretty Pricey for Cheap Eats. I think my Chicken with a Sweet Tea was $9.50 or so...But the food was good and I went with my Friend who's Black and a cheerleader at UNCC. So, I got a lot of weird stares being the only semi-white guy there with the hottest girl in the restaurant.  haha good times
2	8b6LI7jOzQWZmme7FgSR2w	Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only.
4	KGL3c5UyXrGw3YOrTbl4Mw	Been here once and it was really good.  Tried the eggplant parm and it was fantastic.  Hoping to go back to try other menu items including the pizza.  Service was pleasant and friendly and food arrived quickly.
2	fRSCsaANrYswp6bejJAEQ	Ya know, I almost thought about giving Z-Tejas five stars just for having a separate, gluten-free menu, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because the service was way below what I expect when I eat out.  We, a party of five (including my parents, who were visiting from Scotland), were initially seated at a really cramped table when several booths were open. Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.  Our server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related "episode." Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...  The food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy).   Next time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler.
2	huhAmLGZdJF6pxeoM2vanA	I love Chipotle. I always order the same thing (carnitas burrito, extra rice, corn salsa, sour cream, etc) and I always expect the quality to be the same wherever I go. So, I find myself strapped for cash my last day in Vegas after taking some big losses at the blackjack tables, and lo and behold, the neon flashing sign catches my eye so I dash right in!  Wow, this place was HOT. No AC on whatsoever, and it did not make for a pleasant dining experience in 105 degree heat.  Let me say that eating a burrito with hot salsa is probably not the best thing to eat in these conditions, and that was one of the reasons I did not enjoy my burrito. The tortilla fell apart right in my hands, causing me to dump out my contents and making my own burrito bowl.  The rice was also mushy, and the meat was tasteless.   This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. If I find myself starving on the Strip again, I will probably not come here.
2	7YbHonoVjB6glLVFWv5og	A seafood place with questionable seafood.   With scenes of watery docks, and fish leaping from the sea surface painted on the wall, you expect a seafood-centered menu, and that's exactly what you'll find here.  I went with a Shrimp Ceviche tostada and the fish tacos.  While the chips and salsa were good, I can't say the same for the rest of my meal.  The smallish shrimp served on the Ceviche tostada was flavored well enough, but unfortunately none of them were deveined.  I'm an adventurous eater, but I'm not trying to eat the last meal of each shrimp, partially digested.  I sent it back, and the waitress was nice enough to remove it from my bill.  The fish tacos were sloppy, with big pieces of lettuce and a few scattered red onions.  While the fish itself was lightly fried well, there was little flavor and an odd texture to it.    The service was fine, but the product is lacking.  I can't see returning here with all the other options to explore in Las Vegas.
4	qYyxkkhX44KSQK91sYQADQ	Family style bean curd, FTW!  It's so freaking good here and is only $4.95 (or so) for a lunch special.  Order it extra spicy.  I wasn't too fond of the hot and sour soup.  They do give you a plate of Chinese chips and salsa (ha!), ala crunchy noodles and sweet and sour sauce.    Portion size is pretty decent.  The amount of rice they give in the lunch special is a little small but I have been here when they've asked me if I wanted more rice and given it to me.    The tofu was awesome.  Big cubes, stir fried with a spicy brown sauce and a variety of veggies.  Next time I'll give the Ma Po tofu a spin.  With a drink and tip, I got out of there dropping about $8 bucks which isn't bad for a lunch special.
2	KGtxsWeCwmjIdwZTOsn4A	To some this is a real AZ hangout.  To others it's nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with bad food.  There's a little bit of truth to both of those statements.  Bottom line... it's a decent place to take out-of-town guests to experience an old West atmosphere and eat fried chicken.  Order any other food at your own discretion!  Oh yeah, the beer is OK to drink as well.
2	MEu9LenIvIFbKFfOCXxEw	I've eaten here a couple times and can't say that I'm impressed much. It's standard American Chinese fare, pretty heavily over-sauced and not particularly unique in its flavors.  I was pleasantly surprised when I went there for lunch today and the service was very fast despite the large lunch crowd. Perhaps that's because I ordered the ol' standby General Tso's chicken, which they probably have pre-prepared in large quantities. Still, I've had better Chinese in Pittsburgh so I can't give this place high marks.
2	xVHVftpLmjbUG5qUceh2Q	Great concept though poorly executed, service was slow and borderline indifferent, fries served were old and when asked for fresh the response was not so service like. OK for a quick visit though next time I'll go to Red Robin.
4	wWJplEkVVoy32JCoMYhd5w	Well I must say this was the first time I had ever eaten at Schlotzsky's Deli although I have heard of it before.  I loved it.  There was wonderful taste to the food.  I ordered a pastrami on rye and I haven't had that well tasting of a sandwich in years.  I'm not one for sandwich's in general.  I have eaten at other fast food sandwich shops and find this by far better then any other place.  The price is a little more then most of the fast food sandwich shops but well worth it.  Flavor and quality of food alone.  This is not processed meat . I ate at this Schlotzsky and the one in Scottsdale where I had a wonderful salad filled with meat and cheese.  I highly recommend.
2	esKLefOatxfuo5J9EGKXQ	What can you say, its a McDonalds. The cliental at this location is sketchy at best. Can't drown out the pure awesomeness by watching the tele because some guy has his home computer set up in the corner & needs both outlets even though he brought his own extension cord with multiple plug-ins. Lots of not so clean people with some health or drug issues rolling around looking ever so pleasant while asking to bum this or that. Not really sure if I'll get or want back what they are asking for (besides the $$$) so I think its best to not entertain their needs.....Surprisingly, my order came out right but my employees didn't. Its like playing taste bud Russian roulette. Your sure happy when you didn't get the bullet! I did however, see a shirt on a guy inline that made my day so I posted it on FB so everyone else can enjoy. Good Times!!
4	XistDnHSnBZ2T3HWooJYg	Would have given it 3.5 stars if that was an option.  Not average, but not great either.  The portions were slightly above average.  The edamame (sp?) was very good, the service was excellent.  The sushi was good.  Definitely not the best we've had in town, probably not even in the top 10, but in the top 20.  There are at least 7 closer to our house with better sushi, so it is doubtful we would go back, unless we were in the neighborhood, and then the food was good enough to return.
4	gJUaAzfsPHkfUHSbJdBumw	I took some customers to Capital Grille this week.  Actually getting to the restaurant was difficult, at least for me, and I am pretty familiar with Uptown Charlotte.  Every turn that I needed to take was forbidden by either "no left turn" or "no right turn" signs.  I had to end up going several blocks out of my way and ultimately doing an illegal turn to get to the restaurant.  Finding parking is sort of difficult, as well.  From what I understand, Valet parking does not start until 6:00pm and I got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm.  I would recommend parking in the garage for the office building next door to the restaurant.  Capital Grille will validate your parking if you park there.  The food is very good, but also fairly expensive.  I had 8 people in my group and our total bill was right at $1,100.00 including tip.  This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.  As far as sides, I would recommend the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and Au Gratin Potatoes.  We also got the seafood appetizer platter and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The desserts are large and very tasty.
4	BNql7j5zLEbn5sjMPHhPhQ	Great local pizza.  Not as fast or cheap as a chain but worth the wait and expense.   If you can pick it up that is the best and fastest.  I would not recommend ordering on line as on two different occaisions, my online order was not noticed until I called wondering why my pizza had not arrived.   The cannoli are stuffed to order and quite delicious - I haven't had one that good outside of the East coast.   Now, if only they were open on Sunday, I wouldn't have to ever go anywhere else for Pizza.
2	2sdEDPxusx9V5WBR7lgaEQ	I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.  20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she "definitely" put our order in so it "must have been given to someone else by mistake." Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?  The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.  However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.
4	XqKgph6grs63vNjXqiaTYg	Had an awesome time here at breakfast.  Its an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!  We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!    The service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!
2	zjyU0NVBc6a9Jke7HcHQ	I finally got to Mi Amigo Ricardo's, last night. I had been looking forward to going after a friend recommended it and after noticing the full parking lot on many occasions.  But as it sometimes goes with anticipation and high expectations, I was disappointed.  Chips and salsa to start...I've honestly had better salsa from Target. My four year old daughter ate it, and she can't eat anything with even a hint of spice. My friend ordered the guacamole and it was ok, needed a little salt and a squeeze of lime.  I ordered the Fiesta Plate which starts with a cheese crisp.  There was so much cheese that there was no 'crisp', but the kids sure liked it.  The highlight of the Fiesta Plate was the enchilada, which was actually quite good.  The beef Flauta wasn't bad either, just on the tough side.  The taco is where this rating went from an edible 3 to a 2.  The shell was a commercial hard taco from Old El Paso or some other such brand! Seriously, that's the best they could do?!  Every taco my Irish mother has ever made was better than this one.  They could have at least added some Old el Paso taco seasoning to the bland ground beef (yep you heard me right).  Head o Xavier's Casa Reynoso in Mesa if you want a good taco.  Order the Machaca Taco and tell them Tara sent you.  Thank goodness for the good company!  Sorry Ricardo's you're a 'no-go'.
4	9Jebyf12teaAg0g6b0L4g	Homemade pasta cooked to order?   YES  Homemade sauces cooked to order? YES  Exciting and different Italian entrees? YES  Not-pretentious and delicious? YES!  Food at this place blows my socks off. I very much enjoyed this place.
2	AzZg8GnyPt43frIeALDz7g	Ew.  Wendy's used to be my favorite fast food restaurant.  WTF happened to their hamburgers?  They taste like beef-flavored mud with condiments now.  Their fries are terrible too as of late.  What's not terrible is their service.  This is the fastest service and delivery of food that I have ever seen from a fast food joint.  Five stars for service.  Unfortunately, I cannot rate by service alone.  Yuk.
2	qM3FKQbCAf5rO5OzI4DjEA	The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that.  They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row.
2	lr3HaVZwKgtozF4F1oCCdw	Being an Ohio State FANatic.. and living here in Charlotte, Home of the Friendly Fans. A group of 3 or 5 of us went (Me being a OSU, a few others MichiCan't fans and another being a Carolina fan)  Since I know how the fanmanship (if thats a word) goes around this city, I had no worries that I would run into any trouble. Anyway, my buddy goes here alot (MichiCan't fan).   HIGH PRICED DRINKS The crowd inside was cool, (I love the tension, and the back and forth w/ other teams fans) The food was ok.   Just look at the "app" part of the menu. Seemed kinda all over the place. Is this a Sports bar or some check "mid scale" knock off?  I think i had a beer and a shot, after I sawed my left arm off and gave it to the bartender, I made a exit to a OSU bar (Strike City). I didn't get any drinks from there so it was cool.   Knowing my buddies they probably added a drink to my tab since i'm on enemy grounds.   Over all, its a ok place, kinda pricey IMO.
4	nfLydAHqPW2hzfeWbECyA	Always A Great Meal.  I have been to Lone Star Steakhouse on Camelback on several occasions and have never been disappointed.  Lone Star Steakhouse's has a casual and inviting atmosphere and is known for their outstanding customer service  and memorable meals.  Lone Star Steakhouse has so many delicious entr\u00e9es to select from.  There are  steaks which are delicious and reasonably priced. The burgers are large and cooked to perfection and the ribs will melt in your mouth. If beef isnt for you, then you have to select a chicken entr\u00e9e.  The sidewinder chicken sandwich is always  an excellent choice whether served as a sandwich or as an entree.     The entrees are well worth the price, at under $15 (depending on the entree).  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and accomdating.  The manager's makes themselves  avaliable to their guest, as they walk around the dining area ensuring their guest are having a pleasant  dining experience.  If you find yourself in the area give Lone Star Steakhouse a try, you won't be disappointed.
4	aLzBc3Ka12rhNSMCiJQmUw	This place was fantabulous , the food was great, service gets a 4.5 and the price is awesome for the amount of food one gets. The Horseshoe Cafe is a true hidden Gem in the smack-dab- middle of Wickenburg ,AZ and the best thing is the bathroom facilities were the best I've ever seen in all my years of travel . We will go back for sure!
2	cRugi20ooywdYypniUakA	We went here because we had a coupon.  Upon arrival we were told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table.  They took my cell number to call me when the table was ready.  They did call within the time and seated us.  We waited for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged after seated.    Finally the server came and offered us a drink.  We ordered our drink and the insulate italiano.  He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted appetizers.  We stated we ordered one already which he then remembered.  We gotordered the saladfood which wasis actually veryunder good.  When we finally got the chance to order dinner, my wife ordered the grilled chicken caprese and I ordered the rigatoni with sausage.  Her chicken was over cooked, dry and the sauce very bland.  My plate, the pasta was good, the sausage which is not made in house was not too bad.  The meatballs were actually under cooked and raw in the very center.  The sauce was ok, not spectacular, I make a better sauce at home.  The server was ok, not the best we ever had but not the worst.  This is not a place we will go back too.  There are much better itilian places to eat which are comparable in price and the food is made in house and cooked properly. Again, the server tried his best and when we let him know about the food he did take her order off the bill and was very understanding.  He definitely had a desire to see the place he works do better.
2	JP5uiYhJD5MihMm07ez4gA	Not impressed with this Walmart McDonalds. As the cashier told the two customers that asked for a Frape Caramel, "This is the only location that doesn't have Frape Caramels (not sure about that )." The tables were also dirty (felt consciousness about taking a picture with the customer there). With an In & Out Burger in the parking lot, I would have to be craving a Big Mac or not want to deal with a walk in hot temperatures to eat anything more than $5 here.
2	j7dsRLFQQHhIvQtWEBFg	Toms seems to have been dropping in quality over the past few years.  I keep wanting to go back in the hope that it will be as good as it used to be but it just isn't.  This visit will probably be my last.  The bun on the pork sandwich was stale beyond belief.  I had a Maxwell Street Polish.  The grilled onions were still crunchy and the sausage was so dried out it almost had the texture of jerky.  The fried pickles were nothing to write home about.  The only decent thing we had were the curly fries.  Sorry Toms but you continue to disappoint.
2	LXTlXnDxIZmE7PB2pMSsyQ	This review is SOLELY for the flavor Waffle Cone.  Boring.  It has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it.  First, there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it.  It was not a fun and interesting mix of add-ins.    I like their vanilla ice cream, this flavor did nothing for it.
2	SsoaW65oyVxXAC7ydCflxg	They have a nice place here, especially in the winter when it is nice to warm up by the fireplace which is in the center of the room. But they fall down on the food and cleanliness.    Their bathroom is not terrible but not clean either and small. Their salad bar is small and I have gotten spoiled food in my salad. Their pizza is usually good but I have gotten slices that are way overloaded with grease.  I mean I used to take my napkin and soak off the grease before I took a bit.  Sometimes two napkins full of grease. Yeah, not cool.    Haven't been back for some time now due to the food quality issues.
2	S1rOsjDn9wzf9kOPQ4Jnfw	The Skinny: subpar tonkotsu ramen with tough chashu (2), Service - nothing special (3), Value - overpriced for what it is and certainly can get a better deal elsewhere (2).  We came here after all the positive reviews by Yelpers for their ramen.  Their tonkotsu ramen totally lacks pork flavour and would be more suitably called shio/salt broth ramen instead. The pieces of pork are not marinated and are tough. The egg noodles were overcooked and lacked elasticity that comes with house-made noodles.The bean sprouts were sad looking in the bowl. A bowl of ramen here cost $9.95 which is rather expensive seeing how other places give you more for less.  Also tried their Japanese-styled meatloaf which was subpar. Too much filler (ie, bread crumbs), not enough meat. The sauce overtop was too strong (it had a distinct Worchestershire sauce flavour that was overpowering). It came with miso soup, bowl of rice, some shredded cabbage, slices of tomato and cucumber. Overall, edible but not much else to recommend it.
4	nbLOh1O8hQ76M4z0Hsbtjg	Cozy and comfortable, our food was really good, and the waitstaff friendly and efficient!  The mussels were great (garlic madness) and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen. wowowow.  Will definitely try and revisit next time I'm in Pittsburgh.
4	iTGv1dZf4YGnxZrVAju0Q	I went to this place over the weekend when I was in Phoenix and I was kind of surprised that they had a opened up a different location (when I was there last, I went with a few buddies, who know the owner, to the one in Tempe on a Saturday night to grab a quick bite and do a little "pre-partying"...).  The food was still great but this time it was a different crowd...We had a pretty large group for lunch and we shared a 3 huge salads and a couple deep dish pizzas and one thin crust pizza and there were plenty of leftovers.
4	oa9TyCJBLCC3NkRSE1NPIw	Canton Wong 3 has the best delivery Chinese food I have ever had.  I have had the family bean curd, ma po tofu, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein and the veggie egg rolls.  They have never messed up my order, normally take about 45 minutes, and the drivers are always nice.  They take CC over the phone and they ask for your ID when you get there to make sure its your card. Good fraud protection :)  They leave you with coupons, and the food is already reasonably priced.  Only complaint is they are closed Monday and I think they close at 9, so if I want late night eats I have to go somewhere else.
2	vDqY9PZis7E8dEMjGRCmA	not really japanese food. the menu of food is actually a big mix of random chinese and japanese food put together. the sushi it self is poor, the fish quality was really bad, i sat at the bar to get a closer look, and after the look i decided to get things that were safe to eat such as inari *tofu pockets. i always order safe and cooked things when i feel the fish might be a killer several hours later.  the cooked food is blah. i've had much better and i'm pretty sure the grocery store frozen section is better. miso was super super salty and grainy which im not a fan of. overall i wont be coming back if i have a choice...
2	LiztelchhEJ2N3Demx9Ag	You have got to be kidding me, we ordered our Cinco de mayo lunch from Macayos today and when our unknowing runner today got there to put the order in first of all she asked the girl working the counter how big the burritos are because she is a smaller lady and cant eat that much and the lady working the counter told her that the burritos are very small, just about the size of an enchilada and that she would need 2 of them so she ordered 2 for herself and 2 for one of our other employees and each one ended up costing almost $10 a piece and then I ordered the chicken Nachos which I thought would be priced normal and they where anything but that.   I have added a picture of the receipt for the nachos.. You have got to be F-ing kidding me... They Charged $4.99 For the chips and then extra for every additional topping. What the hell is that about. Forget this place, I am sorry if you are a fan but this is plain robbery.
2	fLiQ1QpML3rAAW5DPULqcw	This is the Wendy's closest to my house, so needless to say, it is the one I most frequently visit. 99% of the time, the service is great. However, this review reflects a single negative visit that will stick in my mind every time I visit one of their restaurants.   This would have been roughly a year and a half ago. I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend to get some dinner, and ordered (among other things) a vanilla Frosty Shake. When I got to the window, an older, grayish-haired guy was working, and I tried to hand me a chocolate shake.  As nice as possible, I said to the gentleman that it was supposed to be a vanilla shake. The proper thing to do would have been to say "I'm sorry, I'll take care of it for you."  But this guy didn't do that. He SLAMMED the drive-thru window shut in my face, THREW the shake into the garbage as hard as he could, and screamed something at another employee (possibly profanity, I couldn't tell with the window closed.) I have reported this on the company's website and haven't seen this particular employee there since, so that leads me to believe it was taken care of.  Let's be realistic - I'm always going to eat at Wendy's. This is NOT a bad location, but sometimes a bad visit can negatively impact your whole view on a restaurant chain. I still love their food and still go here, though it's going to be hard to think of Wendy's and not think about this experience.
2	sIyDN7FKfRTblht8lpxMw	Ok this is getting old. The price have gone way up and you definitely don't get what you pay for any more. Charged for cheese tots large. Got this crap. It's bee happening more and more at this location. Does anyone over their age of 20 work or manage there. Cause the ones you have don't seem to care.
4	IdsEje0ObyQUAz8N4Q42IA	I was the lucky birthday girl at a surprise High Tea party for eight at The Inn on Negley.  The service is as good as it gets.  We placed our first tea order (you can change it up however many times you like!) then the chef came out to explain the food she had made.  For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich, egg salad sandwich, and cucumber dill crostini things.  The second tier had two types of scones and cantaloupe slices.  The third tier was mini cupcakes, brownies, and strawberries and cream sandwich type things.  Even though the food did not look like a lot it really was filling.       The atmosphere was beautiful and comfortable.  Not stuffy or too formal at all.  We felt comfortable having a good time while being ultra ladylike.  The place settings were very pretty and just what I expected.    The only reason I did not give The Inn on Negley 5 stars is that some of the food was better than others.  The egg salad sandwich was dry, bland and the bread was a bit stale.  The chicken salad sandwich, however, was the BEST chicken salad I've ever had.    High Tea is definitely worth the experience at The Inn on Negley!  I'd love to go back and stay in a room for a little close to home treat some day.
4	srUb6HHkxIJb156OyuGwWQ	I've eaten here a dozen times over the last 20 years and love it.  Family place, I've never seen an advertisement in the paper or on them Internets.  I think Family Owned says it all.  Somebody's family has a restaurant, cares about customers and service and good Italian food.  The only thing that I ever had that was bad there was the house red wine, which was absolute crap, but I order it all the time.  House reds are always crap at family Italian joints!    Go here next time you consider going out for Italian.
2	7PJ6fQyebNgD8wa3CjWtUw	Pizza was okay, tasted a lot like Peter piper. Just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat. Crust was super super salty. There are many other pizza places I would eat at before I would get this. Jimmy and joes pizza blows this away. If you looking for just okay pizza at a good price this is for you.

After laying around the townhouse most of the morning, I decided to take a drive to get something to eat and shop at Costco in Tempe.  For a year or so I've wanted to try out Niro's Gyros at the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee.  The restaurant is located in a stand-alone building that must have been built and then abandoned by Pizza Hut.  No matter, once inside it is clean, with brightly colored tables and chairs. The front counter is gleaming white tile.    I ordered a double gyro plate, which includes "two toasted pitas served with a mountain of gyro meat with gyro sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries on the side." After adding a large soda and hand over $12.71, I only had to wait five minutes for my number to be called.    This is a casual eating establishment (i.e. plastic forks), so the gyro meat comes packaged within a white styrofoam container wrapped separate in white paper with the hot pitas and fries on the side.  There is enough meat to  overfill both pitas.  I found the whole meal very tasty and enjoyable.
4	cUqXb0RD46G9QU8RqqnxDg	I like Subs by Jim. I tried their Egg Salad sandwich and they just piled it up! I couldn't finish it and only ate half a sandwich 'cause it was huge. The place is operated by an Asian guy and his wife. The place is cozy.
4	AxvIEhSE4heupMLXpUzw	I live across the street from this Applebee's, and I've been going there for years.  terrific service almost every time -- sometimes I've even called the manager over to COMPLIMENT the server.    The decor is kinda casual laidback sports bar.  It's a neighborhood chain folks:  Don't go there expecting the it to be like the Ritz or the Biltmore.  A steak dinner here only costs $10-$12 bucks.  And for that price, it's surprisingly good!!!  I want my steak medium-rare (on the rare side), and that's how they serve 'em to me.  On the rare occasion that I'm dissatisfied, I ask 'em to "repair the damage" and they do it immediately - and with an apology and a friendly smile.  The first time I at here I really liked it, and I told my 'rents.   They wouldn't even try it.  Took me weeks to convince them to walk in the door.  Then, they decided to eat at this Applebee's 3 - 5 nights a week!  And, sometimes they did eat at the Ritz, so they knew the diff.  As far as I'm concerned, for a neighborhood chain restaurant, Applebee's is just fine, thank you very much!
4	9UtKoCJz1aCPcHf7fkS3w	This was the fastest bowl ever. Didn't wait that long. Used my birthday bowl coupon here and was able to get a protein with it!   Large space and great for families. Located in a nice shopping center next to Starbucks.   Everything was hot but I wish they cooked the spinach. I had to tuck them in under the noodles so that they would eventually cook.   Noodles were cooked perfectly (penne rosa). The suave wasn't too spicy like it usually is which is great for me.
4	CO2l1lbe3v3z51JYMwQi5w	1st time Panda Express experience...I thought the food was good.  Simple, good, inexpensive...the food was far better than I anticipated for a chain.  I'll go back.  My sons love going there - I can see why.  BBQ pork, chow mein, Chicken w/ string beans - all very tasty.
2	w7Vzu5E7EXPmgw7PiS6DMA	Pretty solid pizza for the area. Definitely better than any big box chain around. I love how generous they are with the ricotta. The white pizza is my fave so far. Clumps and clumps of ricotta make me quite happy.  Another plus is that they will deliver. I live about 5 miles away and its never a problem. Avoid the wings tho, the last time I ordered them they were way less then appetizing. The slimiest wings i have ever had. We even resorted to putting them into the oven hoping to make them edible. Fail. Ended up just throwing them away.  So pizza good- worth a try, wings- no way jose.
4	rik5Ks2kLwQEguXl5BEMLw	I am from San Diego and have spent my fair share of time eating my way down the Baja peninsula. Having said that, this is the best Mariscos I have had since moving to Arizona. Very authentic. How can you beat awesome Mexican paella for 14 bucks? The bacon wrapped shrimp were to die for. Large, plump, juicy shrimp wrapped with crispy bacon. Six of them plus rice and beans for 13 dollars is a very good deal.  The service was great. Three of us ate till we burst for about 50 bucks. I would give five stars but the location is remote and near the airport so not a great area. Still, we will definitely be back.
4	iywxwnYQitcLELGCDNtYdw	A great place to let the kids blow off steam on days with severe heat advisories!   Better pizza, games & prices than a place I will only refer to as Chucks :D Granted, the space is smaller & 90% of the tables are reserved for parties (seriously, there should be a limit on how many tables can be reserved!). If you just want to let the kids run around for a bit and eat some pizza without a party reservation, you'll want to send a scout ahead of you to find and hold a table.... not even kidding.  The quality of the pizza is not what it would be at other pizza establishments geared towards adult taste buds, but this place IS geared more at entertaining your kids than it is at providing gourmet pizza. As long as the kids are happy, safe & entertained, I'll eat what they give me happily, lol!   There is no mascot in costume OR 'show', but they have games for all ages, not just toddlers, so that's a plus! There are also 3 televisions set up in the dinning area & they are normally set to sports.
4	XvYoF1iDJ3NhAbtdzJ9Png	4 food. 5 service.   Pork & Chicken: regular on wheat Black olives, cilantro, sc, guac, cheese, hot salsa.   Good, but sloppy to eat. It was a while back & it didn't stick out to me enough to remember more than that...
2	3xg6XynnWDXpoIX4w7UTw	I have been to the Swaddee in Chandler and know they do phenomenal sauces and pretty good food so, I was really looking forward to experience Swaddee in Scottsdale.  I had the exact same dish I get at their Chandler location - the red curry.  The sauce was meh, not so much.  Unfortunately the food definitely did not measure up and I think there are much better Thai places in the Valley.
2	KDHNKXxT86tLUpLfjRsWw	A 24 hour taco stand sure comes in handy when the bars close and you want any place to eat that doesn't start with Denny's! It's quite greasy and filling to help soak up the evening's adventures. Plus the 2am crowd is interesting!
4	fMe50XmAtz3RchJN1xsjQ	I came here for an early dinner with a friend and it was a night and day difference from my earlier lunch dining experience at OC. We got there before the dinner rush and got a great booth. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Our meal was good, a hamburger with great flavor and the house salad was good. For dessert we got the Molten Chocolate Cake...Oh my goodness!! It was so GOOD! If you go to Chili's make sure to leave room for this dessert!! The chocolate cake was sweet, moist and warm, the ice cream had a soft chocolate shell and complimented the warmth of the cake with a cool creamy ending.   I might just come back for the dessert. Enjoy!
4	dxHSDjcC3NXVYDcj1Ymew	Never having eaten from a Blimpie's I was excited to try them out and really surprised. I expected something like Subway, but they are blowing Subway AND Jimmy John's right out of the water. If I have my way, I'll NEVER GO BACK TO SUBWAY OR JIMMY JOHN'S AGAIN!  My boss bought me a sandwich-the Ultimate Club-which is one of their warm subs, so I can't speak to the price. But boy oh boy was my sandwich good. No sooner had he laid it down in front of me and it was GONE! The bread was great, they didn't skimp on the meat, the bacon was real and not that floppy chewy stuff-it had a nice crunch to it, but wasn't overdone and I really love their peppercorn sauce!  My boss goes there all the time so they must have good service and decent prices.  I recommend you check it out!
2	8YlsuSjkaaDgZL0Wonjfg	It was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the PHX airport.  We were on a mission for some late night tacos.  I've never been to a Del Taco before but hey, they're open late, so why not?  Pros:  - cheap - open late - drive through was fast and cashier was friendly - we got a bunch of coupons and hot sauce  Cons:  - way too much salt in that beef - just not that good (I actually think Taco Bell's hard tacos are better... can't believe I said that) - random person hanging outside of the front door prompted us to use the drive through
4	sb3C6vupMIWVUlr9dbkeQ	Absolutely the best place in town for pasta - you can tell it's fresh. The service is attentive but not obnoxious, and the bread is always great. The menu's reasonably priced, and there are some really delicious things on there. The cheese ravioli is incredibly rich, and the linguine with asparagus and mushrooms is nice and fresh-tasting.  My only problems: the lighting can be pretty dim, depending on where you sit. I like to be able to *see* my food. I've also gotten dishes where the vegetables were just grilled to charcoal, which is really not tasty.
2	IL6tbxXM8vRdbzA5EZ1qg	I finally got around to trying Bar-B-Q King.  The weather was pretty nice so it was a good day for a drive in.  I always try to keep an open mind when eating at a place for the first time which can be tough after reading reviews about the place.  I ordered BBQ plate which comes with 2 sides.  I got fries and slaw.  My visit was on a Saturday between noon and 1 pm.  The place seemed pretty busy with about 50% of the stalls occupied.  It took a little while to get my food, but not so long as to start thinking, "where is my food."  The server dropped my tray off and quickly moved on the the next car without getting my money.  Odd, but probably the most efficient.  The pork was minced with sauce on it.  The slaw was also minced rather than being shredded.  There was also a sandwich bun along with the fries.  I was able to get some pork without sauce to try first.  The pork was moist and tender, but very bland.  I then tried some of the pork with the sauce and the sauce was bland too.  There was no smoke flavor at all.  The fries were good, fluffy on the inside, but not quite crisp enough.  The slaw was crunchy and fresh, but it too was bland.  I don't really care about the sauce.  Tastes vary and some like it spicier than others.  But the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing.  Overall it wasn't a bad meal, but it wasn't good either.  Again there are better places to go for much better BBQ.
2	AYKSF2ExP9zWa5HNfVjN6A	The food is decent but this place is FILTHY! The bathroom had pee everywhere! The staff was just standing behind the counter while they were out of three kinds of beverages. It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time. I like the food but I'll never eat at a baja fresh again!
4	p3zG6sMgCCa2iTdngfomgg	For being a fast Hawaiian food joint Mokis is great! Way better than the Ono Hawaiian grill places. The food at Mokis is fresh and tastey. I always get the BBQ chicken and love it. The macaroni salad is good and I usually dont like macaroni salad. Mokis is affordable and in a quiet location. The staff has always been nice and helpful.
2	uz4FsjWoJXFYz6yo2AlYlQ	This place is seriously disappointing, especially when you consider it's location.  I have no problem paying $12 for a chicken sandwich.  But I do have a problem paying $12 for a chicken sandwich that is basically inedible.    \\What was advertised on the menu as a 'juicy chicken sandwich served with herb mayonnaise on a bakery bun' arrived as a badly dessicated piece of chicken that wasn't even half the size of the bun it was served on, with a cup of regular mayonnaise on the side.  My boyfriend said his omelet was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Service was inattentive.  The table next to us got up and left after sitting there for 10 minutes and not being greeted.  Memo to Mandalay Bay: perhaps a smaller restaurant with better service and edible food would be in order.  Skip this place.
4	CCp08jVmw5E2QyzmS2GKCw	In addition to sweet treats like donuts and bear claws, they also have lunch and dinner options for cheap. Falafel is not the best in town, but try the gyro, which comes as a sandwich or entree sized plate. They have other standard Mediterranean options such as hummus and kebobs. Seating is limited and would not be good for large groups. Definitely more of a take-out place. I would definitely go back to explore their menu.
4	2dxKEo8PJbmSxlSHK7Z0Q	I swear this has to be their smallest location.  Not that the size of the place ever stopped us from eating there.  But it was close to the bar where we used to Karaoke and it made it a one stop parking for the whole night to grab dinner here, then go sing and drink next door.  Still not a bad proposition.    But really - go for the food.  And yea, they deliver too.  If all you want is thinner pizza it might not make much of a difference to you.  But if you're looking for a pasta dinner or their thick deep dish - then you really want to eat it here.  It almost has a mom & pop feeling to the location. Service won't be super, but it gets the job done.  They know the smell of the place alone will win you over.  You're only going to get much personality out of their delivery folks.    Darn good basic Italian and Pizza fare, with a few specialties thrown in, at a pretty good price.  Feels quite a bit like an old school neighborhood pizza parlor, which certainly adds to it's charm.
2	NcMLc57T79bYXvE47QXDkQ	Pretty blah, really.    It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.  The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.  The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.    Not horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.
2	2bUY9lkli4JtkNHde2sUlg	I've only been here for breakfast twice, and the food is quite good and very reasonably priced (at least by Chicago standards).  However, the service is dreadful!  If it had only happened the one time, I would have chalked it up to a bad day, but both times I've been I've had to wait for menus (the second time I was asked if I'd decided before I'd even seen one), and most recently I ordered something (a side of bacon), never got it, was charged for it, and then told (when I noted that I  was charged for it) that "Oh I could easily get that for you."  Now I've never been the type to pull a Five Easy Pieces, but if it were that easy, why didn't you bring it out when I was still eating?  The first time it was actually absurdly funny, because Mr. Gould was eating at the next table over with his whole family, yet the waitstaff still screwed things up left and right and were decidedly blase about it.  I'm sure the service is much better for dinner, but I can only judge based on my breakfast experience--if you're going to be open and serving customers, please do it right!
4	clEBWpTZN6B1Xh4dZuLTg	Great little BBQ joint on the north end of Madison - emphasis on little. The place has perhaps a dozen tables, most only able to seat two. The decorating scheme is similar to a log cabin, with varnished wood walls and ceiling, and red checkered table clothes on the tables. The food is wonderful - the smoky aroma hits you as soon as you walk in the door. The half rack was delicious. The sauce is a traditional red, tangy and a little sweet. They also serve the sauce on the side if you order a pulled pork sandwich, which is nice.
2	MSebS5LroFezJvAn5mFC7Q	Fried, fried, and well more fried what a surprise. Came here when my brother had a craving for crab and seafood, and this one was the only one still open at that time. Big parking space and from Independence it looks like a large mom and pops grocery store.   Lets say, even when the store was empty our service was still kind of "okay." They have a wide selection of seafood, however keep this in mind this place is all fried. I personally won't come back because the selection on the menu, however if you're all into fried: go for it.
4	DOG38ZUuG2buO5U4NAH8Qg	I am a long time Vietnamese food fan... this place is right across the street from my office, so I hit it up for lunch pretty regularly.   I've had the beef and chicken pho, and the bun (noodle bowl thingy), not tried the sandwich yet, but I will.  The soup broth is great. The noodles are tasty.   The beef soup is my favorite - it contains the yummy viet style meatballs, rare beef, and brisket. Only complaint is that it should come with more herbs, but this is Scottsdale... not Da Vang or Maxim on the Wessyde.   The spring rolls are pretty good. I've had better, but I order them sometimes, anyway. A Viet spring roll is wrapped in rice paper, with noodles, pork, shrimp, and herbs inside. Not deep fried. Yum. Eat with peanut sauce, and some chile sauce or sriracha.  The bun (noodle bowl) is really good, too!  It's clean, the service is fast, and the food is tasty and healthy, unlike most everything else in that shopping center.   To the person who said they never saw a Vietnamese sandwich before... fail. :( It's a wonderful result of the sad history of French colonialism in Vietnam, and these days, typical Viet fare. I love them at Da Vang, and will have to try one at Tea Light some time soon. Expect an update when I do! But... the pho is so good, I don't usually stray from it.   Down side: With a belly full of noodles, I want to take a nap.
2	QSt3iDGRBKWh4FaaNvjNA	Every now and then, you find a restaurant that does one thing and they do it so well that they never need to change. This is not that kind of place, although it thinks it is. The menu offers three options: ribeye, chicken, or shrimp. Seeing as they specialize in ribeyes, I would think they would know how to cook one. I ordered mine medium, expecting a juicy, pink center. I ended up with a very well done steak that was mostly devoid of flavor. Part of the problem is due to the fact that the steaks are served on a hot skillet-plate, which obviously continues to cook the steak as it comes out to you. If you plan on ordering a steak here, I recommend asking for it rare so that by the time it arrives at the table, it's not completely over-cooked.  I understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people. There is a huge selections of different "salads" that you might find at a church potluck (i.e., all sorts of salads that involves pasta, mayo, and other things that are not lettuce). If you want a lettuce salad, there is a large bowl of crisp iceberg with tomato slices carefully arranged in a cylinder, stacked like citrusy bricks.   I imagine the baked potato is fine, because you can't really do a whole lot to mess it up. I ordered the steak fries, which weren't seasoned at all. One of my dinner companions commented that they tasted a lot like the frozen french fries that you bake in your oven at home.   The decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices. From the look of the place, you'd think you were at a small town seniors restaurant that served plain chicken with a side of canned corn. Then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $16-23. It didn't bother me a lot, but it was amusingly awful in terms of ambience.  I don't mean to trash this place too much though. The service was great, and the staff were very accommodating. I was there for a graduation party, and I called in advance to see if they would allow me to bring in cupcakes. I've seen other Champaign-Urbana restaurants add a plating charge for any outside food, if they allow it at all. The Ribeye said it was no problem. I have to give them props for being cool about everything.  Overall, I can't really recommend this. You can get a mediocre steak for a lot less. If you do end up going, just make sure you either order the steak less done that you want it, or be very clear with the waitress as to what medium or medium rare means to you (and be prepared to send it back). Oh, and don't order the fries!
4	CN1MSdsSEvUkH1sJnI8N4Q	I went to The Good Egg on a first date (yeah, a little strange, I know), but it was a great choice.  The service was egg-celent (okay, a little cheesy). Our waitress was very patient as it took us awhile to decide what we were eating between conversation and then wasn't in a rush to get rid of us after we finished eating.   The food was good- I had a Belgium waffle and hash browns; both extremely delicious. I'm going to add this place to my list of places I'm looking forward to heading back to.
2	9Pw42f2KLBPBDi2Aan82w	OK I hate PF Chang's to begin with, so I had a feeling that this place was going to go down in cuisine history as a no go.  Boy was I right.  I started off with a Cosmo which was more like a Nause-mo.  It was watered down and funky tasting and before my dear waiter who was a car salesman in his former life could take a moment to listen to my drink change, he brings back another.  Well alcohol is alcohol and I needed a lot at the moment, so I indulged.  I had a hard time deciding on what country of Asia I wanted to dine from, so I decided to hedge my bets and go with maki and firecracker shrimp.  I wish I would have ordered more maki instead and a side of edamame as my coworker did because my "spicy" sauce for my "firecracker" shrimp tasted more like maple syrup than anything.  Blech.....maple syrup on bok choy.  Some people claim that this one is the bees knees, but the next day I was ready to fall to my knees (in front of the porcelain god, no less.)
2	XJ74THDcsZH2ReGg7yYPLA	I'm not sure why this place is listed as "closed" on YELP, I just ate here for lunch today, so I know it isn't closed! I had the lasagna, coworkers tried the spaghetti & meatballs, and the ravioli & meatballs. I liked the lasagna, though it was a bit bland for my taste - something like you might get in a cafeteria. Fresh though. One coworker said they liked the ravioli, the other coworker said the spaghetti was just "OK." So a fair review seems like 3-stars.   They deliver and they were on-time as we gave them a specific time for delivery.  September 30th update: Had lunch here for the 2nd time today and tried the Sicilian sandwich (currently the #4) - it was terrible! The bread was fresh and the peppers tasted great, but one of the meats had a really bad aftertaste. For a $10 sandwich I expect better! **Got a mild case of food poisoning from this place, I'm guessing that wasn't just a "funny aftertaste" with the meat!
2	zhfgLJJ0NW9Ts6alF7os6w	Food was OK, service was good. But it was so hot We could not enjoy it. Server said its been hot for a few weeks. Sorry its in acceptable.  I will not go back to this location.  There is no reason for 83 degrees, yes 83 I looked at the thermistat set at 74 reading at 83.  If your AC is broke fix it if your store is 83 degrees close it until it is fixed.  My friends face was flushed because of the heat.
2	1TfzvXfPzXE4q6dmg4SwNA	Not impressed.  Ordered medium-well (some pink) patty melt and fries.  Fries were not fresh but frozen junk and burger was dripping in so much blood the bread was soaked through.  Lost my appetite and left.
2	QbFFXAfkHTnwVYNSpo0PIg	The restaurant is exactly what you would expect from a family owned pizza place. We only ordered wings and were really disappointed. The wings were so small, we really felt let down. The flavor was decent. We agreed they probably use Frank's sauce. Also ordered well done and didn't get it. I wish it was better. We live close and this would have been a great replacement for our usual wing place farther away.
4	6Z50JWG86fxabeR6HqzNw	I have been to Cool Beans a couple of times thanks to a co-worker. This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee with a friend or meet for a work meeting. The coffee is great and I usually buy the endless cup as I stay for a couple of hours. The food is great as well. The sandwiches are definitely something to try.  The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. There are tables and chairs throughout and then there are some comfy chairs if looking for a more relaxed seat. If you are in Madison on the East Side this a great place to go.
2	4QZeWETvixyw1gHMTKSIrw	About 8 or so years ago, an old, ornery Black man started smoking ribs and chicken at the back of the Rhythm Room to sell to customers.  The meat was salty, tangy, and delicious.  RR management basically ran him off, stole his recipes and brought in Randy and co.  If left to Corritore, the evolution of the Blues in Phoenix will have the same fate - no resemblance of it's rich heritage - just drunk suburbanites pantomizing and living out their fantasy.  Without soul however, Gumbo is just chicken soup.
2	2ECERcfAmtlRcCENsr74Fw	Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype.
2	q8mPOcg7rtzJo0zNtMGQ	Things to get at Kona Grill. Macadamia Nut Crusted Chicken.  Things not to get at Kona Grill. Everything else.   Pros: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Cons: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Misc.: Basement like atmosphere. Car fumes. Families (ugh, i.e., CHILDREN). You're still in a mall.   Aloha Kona. Aloha. Mele Kelikimaka. Mahalo. Magnum P.I.
2	g6qUBnbtOs1cCsPKsrvzGQ	Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience!   That being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required.   She took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup.   Now, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.  When our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch.   Overall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon.
4	8sA4rvyPVGnEnyu7iaEMyA	This little Chinese restaurant, tucked into the corner of a small mall, on the corner of Dobson and Southern, is a hidden treasure. They have great food at amazing prices. It's an old school, chinese restaurant with no frills, bells or whistles but large flavorful dishes, house made eggrolls, dumplings, wontons and attentive service abound. I definitely appreciated my meal and thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to escape the standard commercialized chinese food that abounds in this day and age. Kudos to this hidden Asian gem!
4	5jK4kzMbk52uFlW6SBqdQ	In the Pineville area and need a quick breakfast meeting meal for the office? Here you go! Call ahead and within 15 minutes, your dozen bagels (sliced) and Box of Coffee is ready to go. Comes with 2 cream cheeses and the staff was very friendly about the order. Sometimes places, during breakfast, get irritated with large orders like this...not here. The place was busy and they were very helpful. The inside was larger than expected too!
4	QydeTZuEhE0gH5gRkSn5Q	Always fast clean yummy and the manager dude is on point as far as high customer service. They messed my taco up. He smiled, personally made the correct taco, and said have a nice day in less than 30 seconds. :)))
4	GtpsK4SaRLrNvFPG6WPOA	ShooGoo was sort of a template 4-star place: good food, American menu, big ole portions, and nice service. It lacked the special zsa zsa zsu needed for 5 starrs.  My filet with B\u00e9arnaise sauce was excellent. The highlight of our meal, however, was our mushroom with Gorgonzola appetizer. Mmm. And, of course, they have the nice view, though that was pretty pervasive throughout Sedona. sunny az... yow, bill
2	fDPZDNwpw26nipTLgAIQ	Salty steak and greasy chicken for far too much money?  Limp salads with gross 'custom' dressings?  No thanks!  I'm not a big fan of the Outback, as you can see.  I don't like the way the server crouches down to take your order and I'm not a big fan of rolling my potatoes in giant rocks of salt.  Someone with a definite sugar deficiency creates their salad dressings, and one of their chicken alternatives (the Alice Springs Chicken, I believe) comes coated not only in bacon and cheese, but far too much of it and I think with a side of extra grease.  I would just be wary of any restaurant that charges you $20 for a steak AND shows football.
2	0GcRowPZQrLiQ4rv0GaYA	Oh Burger King, you had your friends going for you and then you went and changed them thus forsaking my love.  This particular location is right in the middle of the action in East Carson Street (mostly 'cus I don't think SSW is action-able, haha).  It's grungy.  It can be dirty.  On a good day service is average, the rest of the time you wonder why you even bothered to show up.  BUT ... once in a while you just get a craving for some artery clogging red meat product patty, greasy fries, and pop and that's what BK is there for!
4	11mnUodu9PP4OLULlgbpXQ	This is a great place for lunch. I ordered the Turkey Green Chili sandwich and it came with my choice of chips for $6.99. We got there just before the lunch rush around 11:40. They told us to find a seat and they would bring our order to us. We sat at one of the few tables outside. Lots of people started coming and picking up to go orders. We saw their delivery car pack up big orders as well. This place is busy! It took a bit longer than expected to get our food, but when we did it was served with a smile and looked wonderful! This sandwich is a star, there was tons of meat with the perfect amount of spicy toppings and the bread was toasted just right.  I might call ahead next time to avoid the wait... This has become my favorite quick lunch sandwich in the area...go try it!
2	ysDQpLNN9QA1tJKP5IgWJQ	Very small restaurant with the old-school wood panelling and cheapie tables and chairs.  Only Bud and Miller on tap and they don't take credit or debit cards.   The older woman who runs the place (Anna?) was adorable and super sweet, so I hate to say anything bad about the food.  That being said, the pizza was allright, but they used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  If I am paying $12 for a pizza, I expect fresh ingredients.  Anna's is actually right next to a Domino's and between the two of them, Anna's wins hands down, but it's pretty easy to find a better pizza in Madison.
2	OtQz1mcA7CZgQkL6gyp2mg	This review would have been a 3, if I hadn't seen a little bug like creature scamper across our table at the end of our meal.  Although the food was good, I had the red velvet pancakes, and added over-easy eggs and sausage -- I can't get over seeing that bug! And it was *on the table*. It makes me wonder where else bugs are hanging out in this place. I understand, bugs be bugs and they get into places, especially places that have food, etc.... but still, I just can't shake it, so I won't be back here.  I also was not a fan of the park-bench seating in the booth my husband and I were sat at.  Feel like the place could use a slight renovation (but keep the old charm), even just change out the tables. Nothing major. Also, keep up on the bug spray... or something. I don't know, but please just keep the little critters out of there.
4	EK6ItSucQWST0H4Cs4AQ	Their food is delish!   No matter what dish I've had , I've never been dissapointed.  I would say the prices sometimes are a lil higher but food is good!   I was a fan before they changed locations, they used to be a small hole in the wall on 16th and Thomas... I hate their new locations it's hiddend and parking sucks.  BUt the food is worth it!
4	Kj10imL38qwgTiMwDP0icA	Had lunch here today.  Great selection of bagels and way better than the chain bagel places here in AZ ( but not as good as bagels from back in NY!)  I really like that the bagels have toppings on both sides and they serve boars head meat...along with snapple.  Good place for a quick breakfast or lunch!
2	xWhv59AfIznRWm6YcI3cQ	When I was a kid the Western Bacon was one of my favorite burgers. Forget about Whoppers and Big Macs because I was all down for putting a fried onion ring and BBQ sauce on my burgers.  Fast forward to today; I honestly don't think this is the best fast food sandwich anymore. I think everything has changed about it. Well basically it seems like Carl's Jr has changed all of their vendors and quality of products. Ingredients are still the same, it just tastes different. Carl's Jr. buns are now kind of waxy, their burgers don't taste that good, and the bacon is just chewy fat strips. I just hate these sandwiches now. I won't be eating one again or at least not for awhile.    p.s. I had to order their onion rings because they changed up their fries. I'm sorry but I loved their French fries, but their new ones are the worst. These onion rings suck too!
4	coeTVumQolBKi5McTmHVCw	We were helped by one of the co-owner Sophocles, nice guy. Honey got the Gyro Combo - Includes: Kyklos Gyro, Regular Fries, and a Large Drink - $9.95 and I got the Chicken Gyros - $7.25.  I was looking for some garlic sauce, I don't think the store actually have some, but give us some Tzatziki for free.  Chicken by itself are delicious, once mix it with lot of Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Yogurt.   taste is more mellow.  The Gyro is ok, I like those at Filfila Mediterranean Cafe better.  Fries are crunchy and fresh.  will go there again since I got a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com for $2 (min. purchase $35).
4	sSKLIv0be56jKDvWpRpk4Q	When someone says "Lets get Mexican for breakfast... there is this place on 12th street and Van Buren...." my stomach takes a dive and common sense tells me that it's probably not a very good idea, but I was in an adventurous mood and Dallas G. is normally always spot on with his restaurant choices, so I decided to give it a whirl.   Um... hell yeah! La Tolteca was awesome! Any place that has a full on Mexican bakery staring you in the face when you walk in is fine by me! I was lovingly admiring the watermelon shaped cookies from afar. I will be back... my stomach said.   We got up to the menu board and I was impressed with the huge selection of items they had to offer. Honestly, if you cant find something that gets the juices flowing here, you have some seriously demented taste buds.   I opted for the egg and cheese burrito with pico and a side of beans and rice. I slathered on the green sauce from the salsa bar and munched away at the deliciousness as the sweat poured down my face. This was one spicy, but tasty, breakfast!   D.G. got the huevos rancheros. I didn't try them, but they looked pretty damn good and he seemed to be enjoying them. He also opted for the horchatta, which I normally don't like, but was pleasantly surprised with.   Another thing I really want to point out is that the people that work here are REALLY nice, even to us whities. Normally I do not get such a welcome reception, but honestly, the workers were dancing and singing to the festive tunes and even the lady at the pick up counter had a smile on her face.   I planned on hitting up the bakery for that watermelon cookie, but my $6 breakfast burro, rice and beans had me FULL... so I will be back for you my little cookie.. yes... I will be back!!!
2	rXDAkSDc3D1RbJwjhESA	Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth, and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram's has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that's actually true, then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.  I also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent, so plus one star for having vegetarian soups, and more importantly, actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of "vegetarian" though I kept that to myself...  As others have noted, the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly, but I wonder if there's some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.  Also: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing.
2	LAItTAnKPuAlWC6rWq4uw	The food was ok. Place is very clean, hence the 2 stars.  The gaming area had all faulty machines.  Some of them don't work at all and the others either suck your tokens or spit less tickets. Overall so disappointed that I'm writing this review while I'm still sitting here.  No value for money.
4	SAw7H1VrCbNmxNIo6SHS4Q	I had one of those nights where I was hungry for something but didn't know what and that's just the worst. I was driving around and saw this place out of the corner of my eye and took a chance on it. I got the Jerk Chicken Small Plate and was reasonably priced for the amt of food you get (chicken, rice and cabbage). Chicken was very succulent, flavorful and fell right off the bone. Order was up in the less than two minutes and was a quick transaction. Very quaint with the menu on a chalkboard inside.
4	TWDRzp1K22Mg73jC12kgSg	This is one of our go-to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids.
4	LMxWhRZ9dTTPBgzXaAflEw	This place was awesome. You are completely thrown by the outside. You walk in and you feel like you're in an upscale Scottsdale joint without the Scottsdale prices. The food was amazing. There were 4 of us and we were all very happy with our dishes. The Italian Sausage is amazing!
4	KZ8WtlWTFu8ybwEZ0LnwA	I often crave the ravioli.  Little pillos of cheese in a tomato sauce splashed with a hint of cream.  Delicious.  The rest of the menu is standard Italian fare.  They restaurant is friendly and kind, desserts are good and the bread is always hot and garlickly.  (A plus in my book).  Give it a whirl, I always called it my "compromise" restaurant when I didn't want to spring for Marcellinos.  It's not as tasty, but not nearly as expensive either.
4	F1vqQTStNpJhNE1k4zYdA	Very good food and I like the atmosphere and style. Maybe it is a little 80'ish looking on the design, but who doesn't love a place where you are taken back Miami Vice and shoulder pads in your leather jacket.  The food is very good an I've tried a variety of things without being disappointed. Oven backed pizzas are good, shrimp and grits ok but I've had better. The baked Alaskan (I thought it was fish when my fianc\u00e9 ordered it) is a wonderful dessert but only available certain times of the year.
4	y1yQByWsKij0nxOn8hUEg	Yeah, I know it's a chain, but it's a good chain. Really dig their Thai chicken pizza, and the appetizers arre above average. It may be overdone but I can't help liking the place. It's also a good go-to choice when you can't all agree on what you want to eat. At CPK there's always a pizza to suit everyone!
2	ayxjsWx9yFpkwyVvaMs0lg	I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.
4	iqJzJ0bSvuwmERZ9DleCA	We like to stick with the mom 'n' pop shops, for the most part. Almost every chain we've gone to over the years has gone downhill, while the smaller places work a little harder for your loyalty.   This place is not 100% consistent, but I have to say that it is one of the better places. I hate going places where the food seems like deep-fried dingleberries saturated with special sauce. I usually get the orange chicken and it's pretty light and crispy, not soggy. The lunch specials are pretty fairly priced and good-sized portions.   One server is a little abrupt but she keeps my water filled, which is more than I can say for most places I go to. They always look like they're going to cry when I tip well. I guess they are just used to people being cheap.
2	fQ6fjQYqC5i0EcoX7zmMw	This place is really trying to be upscale, but it's not.  To me an upscale place is where you can't afford to bring your little brats.  First, the good.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  Refills kept on coming.  I ate here for 6 meals over my 2 day stay at the resort and I never ordered the same dish twice just so I could try a variety.  Here is a rundown of what I ate and the quality:  -Chicken Quesadilla: So soggy it was falling apart, inedible -Arcioech (sp) Scallops:  It's Arizona, there are no fresh scallops.  They were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess.  The potatoes and Dijon dressing were great though. -Eggs Benedict: Very good, cooked perfectly.  They do it a little different and give you smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon.  Not a bad change but they were a little cheap on the quantity of salmon. -Matador Hamburger: Fantastic burger and they will cook it rare.  If you order one well done, you shouldn't be allowed to review any red meat. -Center Cut Filet: Obviously not a prime cut.  Perfectly cooked and seared.  Veggies were also well seasoned and not overcooked.  Good choice. -Salmon: Great seasoning, slightly overcooked and bizarre sauce with the consistency of pudding under the garnish.  The sauce added nothing to the fish. -Creme Brulee: Very nicely done, maybe a little too much heat on the sugar, but still delish! -Caprese Salad: Tomatoes were flavorless and old (dried out appearance). Mozzarella was obviously a Costco purchase (not bad though).  If I wasn't eating here for free, I would balk at it just for the prices let alone the mixed quality of the food.  No hot waitresses here, but the server staff was great.
2	8IuvDaH3rVSSPvNAm54YIg	We went to RA last night, having been there before we knew what to expect, but this time, it was a lot worse. The service was terrible, and it wasn't that busy. The Happy hour, have good prices on it, but all of the appetizers are deep fried, and there aren't too many choices for sushi.
2	QsUz9mRpjLwdsCkmo7Muww	Dikadee's is perpetually filled with yuppies that are all crowded around the counter looking confused.  The food is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about.  The chicken salad is not good, or like you would normally expect it to be, it is more like cold cut turkey salad.  I really recommend tasting it before ordering.  Parking is a nightmare, and don't park where you aren't supposed to or you will get towed.  Dikadee's is only open for lunch.
2	cqEMZWm14GYLboWXrvnBKw	I paid $27 for 8 fish and chips, cole slaw and hush puppies.  I was very disappointed.  Fish was square patty,  cole slaw taste terriable, KFC's taste much better.  4 tiny tiny hush puppies are $1.50.  I had better fish and chips at Ivar's in Seattle, WA and Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  It didn't worth it.
2	ldKIbd30TFSao13neIIM6w	Just moved to Madison a few months ago and while I've accepted that we're not going to find the same caliber food here as in Philadelphia, I was still quite underwhelmed by Lao Laan Xang. We tried for take out one Saturday afternoon a couple weeks ago and not only was our food not all that great but the customer services was terrible.   My partner placed the order while I waited outside with our dog. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes so we took a long walk with the dog down Atwood Ave, stopped by Bad Dog Frida, etc. 20 minutes later we come back and the food is no where near ready. Not only that but my partner tried for over five minutes to get the attention of any of the servers/hostesses to check on our food order. He said they acted like he was bothering them and wasting their time.  Another 10 minutes went by and our food still wasn't ready. Finally a good 45 minutes after we ordered we got our take out. Now mind you the restaurant was somewhat busy at the time but please don't tell us 15 minutes and then take 45 minutes. Give us an honest estimate and we'll come back at the appropriate time and not keep checking to see if our food is ready every 10 minutes.  Once we got the food home we were less than impressed. Partner's rice-based chicken dish was almost too bland and also too peppery (black pepper not vegetables) at the same time. Also the vegetable mix was most certainly frozen (I have the same mixed veggie blend in my freezer).  My order of what I think was called Honey Chicken was better but less than stellar. The sauce was overly sweet in a cloying way. I ended up draining half of the sauce from my dish before eating the rest. The veggies and chicken however weren't all that bad.  Overall, we won't be going back. And seeing as how we also didn't love Sala Thai, unless Ha Long Bay comes through for us, I might be giving up on Laotian/Thai food while we live in Madison...
2	ubdROKhic52kHLFpz8N8nw	Had the meat omelet that was supposed to be "loaded" with meat, but was instead sprinkled with meat. Toast comes in large slices, but heard from the couple at the neighboring table that we could all grow a year older waiting on jelly, so they shared their extra jars with us. They also shared their Tabasco sauce. Service was slow and nothing to write home about. We didn't know who to tip at the end of our meal...our server or the adjacent table who loaded us up with condiments b/c they were quite helpful.
4	Ep1LZTrIxfP711XnFeyw	very good food. the beans and horchata were yummy. i got the beef and chicken flauta and they taste homemade. so good!! i will definitely come by for lunch. i had a groupon coupon it was well worth it
4	Y0zh1xp254iNKpC6UqTQ	I live a couple minutes walk from this place so I find myself coming here for lunch or dinner often when I'm in the mood for Chinese food.    The servers are nice and good service is always important to me.    I haven't tried many of their dishes as I always tend to order the same dishes but its a good place for Chinese food in shadyside.  The lunch specials are a great deal and I do like the interior of the restaurant.    It's pretty much straight forward American Chinese food, not amazingly authentic or true to actual Chinese cuisine, but good enough for our western taste buds.
2	YCAt9bcDkI9k3YeKeXeuHA	My mom didn't know this was a chain when she sat down or she would've selected someone else for me to join her and others... overall it was a 2 star experience. It took forever to get coffee and then refills and that's not acceptable in my book when in Vegas on 3 hours of sleep.  The french toast was fine, nothing more/nothing less. This is not a breakfast place.... I have enjoyed lunch at their Denver location.
2	j74mJ7VmHGiU9sXm3s5rw	We were picking up a car being serviced and had an appointment to speak with a salesperson about a possible trade in. We were a little early, and starving, so went into the restaurant. It is retro cute and clean. I cannot comment on the food, we waited an hour and 20 minutes and walked out. We told the salesperson, sorry, but we needed to leave and eat! Not his fault, but sadly, his loss. Don't go if you are hungry!
4	tiLlIROXpKI5Xp0f8YuL8w	I visited Best Hong Kong due to my friend from Tempe who told me he had to stop by here every time he came back home.  Raved about the duck.  I've never understood duck...very little meat and bony.  Why not just eat chicken?  Anyways...  We were greeted by a very non enthusiastic male server who seemed to grunt more than speak.  I thought maybe it was a language barrier...but my buddy said he was his least favorite waiter and a horrible one at that.  We both work in the service industry and are very sensitive to bad service.  He took our order competently and brought us back cokes and waters (always order water!!).  He brought the food out and was not very agile in placing our plates (my buddy ordered for both of us and always listens to his stomach!).  Twice I thought he was going to put a plate on top of a plate...I hate when I have to move stuff around for them to place it.  After that...we didn't hear from him until he brought the check...even the sound of a straw being sucked with little beverage failed to get his attention.  Finally a girl who was hanging out by the kitchen spotted us and brought refills.  The service was the worst part...  The food was incredible.  My buddy ordered a 1/2 duck, 1/2 chicken, pepper pork chops, beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.    I've never had duck this good.  This duck was actually meaty (still bony, but what can you do right).  Very, very good.  Blew the chicken away.  The chicken was good too...but it was a very familiar taste.  Beef chow fun isn't my favorite noodle, i prefer chow mien, but I went with it and it was good.  The pepper pork chop was very good.  I think i ate more of that then anything else.  The Chinese broccoli was delicious and I ate many stalks of it (and I'm pretty much anti-vegetable unless prepared perfectly).    I hear they have other servers that are better and I'd recommend going in on their days of work.  The food is incredible and I'd definitely give this place 5 stars if the service was superb.
2	Dj6K1i902X5A1v6FHrP7Q	This place is just ordinary, there is nothing really great about it except that they deliver.  the best item I had on their menu was the shrimp in lobster sauce, the sweet and sour and orange chicken tasted like it was previously frozen and similar to something you can buy at costco in the freezer isles. They are a bit overpriced, but I think most of the asian food in Arizona is overpriced and lacking in authenticity.
2	MEsl5OKfAbyqpcXKK1zNNA	I can't say my expectations were too high, but I definitely expected better.  My cashew chicken was inedible, and I was only able to eat the fried rice and egg roll (which were fine).  The chicken was so chewy that I could not bring myself to take a second bite.  Will not go back.
2	EaLCWVgKoAhJxa11VIFWIg	I've been here only twice. Today would've brought the experience down to a 1 star, but the previous one being a 3 - I settled on a 2.   This place is huge and dripping with atmosphere. It's sprawling in fact and the patio wraps around a duck and swan pond... can be fun, but can also be annoying. Depends on how you feel about birds. Maybe it's romantic. Maybe it's disgusting. Personally, I find it to be a little bit of both.  The food is average. The salsa is very tasty, but not spicy enough. Today they were having a buffet style thing for the mad rush of mother's day. The place was empty though. There were a lot of wait staff - about one per table... on a buffet night even. With all these servers, we found it nearly impossible to get service.  We opted out of the buffet since it didn't seem cost effective (or appetizing, but we had driven so far we thought we should make the most of it), and sat at the bar forever waiting for one of the 5 servers to stop watching Castaway on TBS long enough to ask us what we wanted.    The margaritas were weak and not very cheap. The waiter was rude, but he brought us a refill during a commercial. I think it's simply too far to be worth it. If the food was above average and the service was good, this would be a fun time. The whole area is a very touristy spot. I'd suggest it as a place to take your parents when they come visit you.
2	StJ0vk8csAHn9x3zFvhZA	I've been to better breakfast joints!  However, the service has always been good and it's close to our house.  The food is nothing to write home about.  The eggs benedict are decent and the omelets so, so.   However the hog wild skillet breakfast is quite tasty!
2	yHRa9qa1C397CE5ipB7oQ	They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now
4	51UO7iNAuuJJef0n7FRapg	Really enjoy their chicken sandwiches. They are never dry and always super moist. The prices are a bit higher than I would like, but it's not a bad deal. My kids love their chicken nuggets but they are not big fans of the waffle fries. I would prefer regular fries over waffle ones.   I know they are closed on Sundays for religious beliefs maybe that's why we had to wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes. They were definitely packed at almost 2pm.
4	7MoVNKSYDxvMQXdSSLtTOA	Honestly this place is around where I work, so its kind of the last minute "oh crap, who's supposed to buy lunch?" type of days, this place is it!  Little Dumpling is pretty much it (hey, it sure as heck beats the typical fast food, burger type of joints)  They have great lunch specials, take out, delivery...Various items on the menu..thai and chinese mostly.  Their Thai Tea isnt bad, its good on a summer day! Dont get me wrong starbucks is around the corner, but I'd rather pay $2 for a big cup of tea vs $2 for a grande (and I love starbucks!). Its nice to know that good chinese place is around the corner from work
2	gUIEZM8YvRtOkbKNznmFg	This place is another chain that used to be the only show in town. I have not been to one in years, but stopped here to lack of safe dining options in the area. They have a buffet of sorts behind the counter with all the side dishes. Did not try the cornbread or get a platter, but if you add a combo the sandwich then you are looking at over 10 bucks for lunch. Turkey is probably the better choice for a sandwich, but I ended up with the ole Chicken Carver at $7. Nothing to write home about as the pulled chicken was cold (was it supposed to me?) and the bun was a store bought kind of French roll. They slathered honey mustard on that bread (unknown to me at order) and I still needed to use the BBQ sauce at the table to get some flavor. The BBQ sauce is another story also - there are about 100 artificial ingredients in that bottle if you care about that stuff. Might give the turkey one more chance in the future.
2	GU8BBj7XAELfKZiQYm0Dg	This place is close to my office, but I'd never been before. There was a  Groupon offered last week so I thought I'd try it out.  The good: my salt bagel was *actually* salty. Since most places have decided that sprinkling one or two crystals of kosher salt on a bagel is good enough, this made me happy. The service was quick and pleasant and the restaurant was clean and well-kept. Onion, lox, tomato, and cream cheese were all as one would expect.  The bad: yet another fluffy-thing advertising itself as a bagel. My bagel had no chew whatsoever. I get more resistance from an Einstein's bagel.   I'll stick with Chompie's for now.
2	NPvXWLhCmGKlqHsM7DLA	when i go here i usually get the Grilled pepper jack chicken enchilladas with beans and rice and i really enjoy it. the service is fine meaning they could be a little more attentive but other than that its great i really like sitting outside outlooking the street (at night only) because its great scenery
4	2dRzCFcR8ECVro9LRIseQA	i really like this restaurant. this is a combo bar & restaurant. THERE IS ALSO OFF TRACK BETTING FOR HORSES!  in the main room is a bar surrounded by tables. i think it looks pretty cool. all the tables have black table cloths and candles. there are multiple tvs for betting or sports.  the food is advertised as ecclectic. the menu is large with a great variety of food. this is not just plain bar food. they have ribs, steaks, calamari, sandwiches, burgers, chicken, pasta, etc....  i think the food is really good. the steaks are great and they give you plenty of quality vegetables for sides. the salads are large and they have a variety of specialty salads. appetizers are priced better then other places. they have a cheap appetizer menu 7 days a week for happy hour. appetizers during happy hour are ONLY $3.00. they have simple appetizers like wings up to really good like calamari. 3.00! they are known for their deep fried pickles which i find good. if you are looking for a more quiet place to sit other then the bar area and tv area, there is a separate dining room. i've never been let down by their tasty food and quality service. you can go here for a good party time, a romantic dinner, or a family dinner. good all around place. they have a smokers patio with misters.
2	FcrkY9zg0V11ueaW0C1FhQ	I wanted to like this place, I really did.  I had heard good things about it and was looking forward to going there, maybe I just built it up too much.  Maybe I hit on an off night.    The decor was pretty cool, if a little random (local art is great, but not everybody likes nude portraits while they eat).  Overall it was funky and I liked the bar area, but what the hell is going on with the toilet paper hanging from the ceiling.  It's hard to think of anything less desirable than to feel like you're in a giant toilet (think trainspotting).  Maybe its to make it feel like a dive bar, but leave that to EB's.  My real beef, however, was with the food, I had the she-crab soup and crawfish etoufee.  The soup was spicy but didn't have any depth to it, just kind of hot for the sake of being hot.  Same thing with the etouffee, peppery but no real flavor.  And I know people are going to read the cabo review and think I have OCD, but the etouffee rice was either dried and hard or uncooked and hard.  For god's sake people it's not difficult, I cook rice all the freakin time.  If it's hard, don't send it out!!!  People don't want to eat that!  I'm at the point where I'm just going to boycott rice altogether, it's going to be tough, my sushi choices will be limited, but goddamn it, this is what it has come to!  Do you see what you've done people?!?!  Are you happy??   Sorry for the rant, back to the review:  All in all the service was good, the people were friendly, and I would go back to drink and probably give the food another shot, just hold the rice.

Hash browns were burnt when I asked them to be preppared crispy. The cook needs to learn how to cook on lower temmperatures. Will not go back there. Overall bad experience and it was dead in there. No reason to cook on high temps and tear down food quality.
2	sWh5v7KcfD950wqOGe2wfw	I didn't necessarily dislike Dobhan, but I'm in no hurry to go back.  The waitstaff was attentive but the food too slow to come out.  Food was okay but OVERPRICED. We dropped $40 on two samosas, an appetizer sized salad that was supposed to be an entree, and a vegetarian dish that was 4 pieces of tofu, a few vegetables, and some rice.  Next time we'll  head to Himal Chuli.....or even good old Wong's down the street.
2	AyBz9lroao3mzwedDZAjA	Honey Bear's is a place that was at one point a celebrated BBQ establishment, but it is now only a shell of its supposed former greatness.  The setup and quality are fast food, but the prices are a notch higher.  The meat tastes alright, but nothing special.  The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive (although the Central Ave. location is nicer, it is considerably more crowded).  The portions are meager.  All of this leaves you with the feeling that it would be a good $5 lunch.  Unfortunately, it's not just $5.
2	qLYrCIxv9JERrngBXyDA	Was in town for Wrestlemania 26 and was looking for somewhere to watch Michigan St. play in the NCAA tournament, boy did we choose the wrong place... Order took forever, sat down, they mixed the wife and mines burger temperatures up! Sooooo, we had to wait some more! I ended up filling up on fries and pickles! In there defense they knew they messed up and treated our party of 10 to free desserts, which were really, really good! Kids had fun, some kid kept winning stuffed animals out of the claw game and gave them to my boys!
4	aZ9le6Gwd8S10Jb82nruA	I'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear (inside and out) as if they're going to give me the worst case of E. Coli/Salmonella/Asbestos/Gun-shot wounds I've ever had.  But I just don't care when it comes to Carolinas!  Having worked at Sky Harbor for few years I ate here too often to count and never had a bad experience.  Just don't look too closely at your surroundings when you're picking up your grub!
4	PU3Jfw16bKqnDPeFuaMAQg	Fresh ingredients cooked and served warm.  I liked their soft shell shrimp tacos, and the new bbq Carnita(sp?) tacos. I liked the texture, seasoning, temperature, harmony of the flavors.  I tried the chopped chicken ranch salad before, it wasn't too exciting and way over-dressed.  The chips and salsa weren't too great.  I like the interior decoration here.
4	JcxiwqS3I2OSuWngHbjhw	Super supper club!!!   Generous and reasonably priced drinks, friendly staff and some of the best fish in the land?!!??    It is easy to see why this place is packed as early as 5:30 on a Friday night. I am fussy and this place has me captivated after our first visit. Time to try the steaks which people say are great.
2	UyUfNvl3tm5V9l3jvE6QlQ	Alright, for all the hype I heard about this place, it is probably the worst pizza I've had in the valley (next to the new & improved Domino's, yuck!).   Maybe a long time ago it was good, I don't know, but now it is a big over priced blah!
2	D6bRCBJGEsRX7VYwxFHmow	In the time it takes to go through this drive through, I could slaughter a chicken, de-feather it, butcher it, and grill it...then have time to pick lettuce leaves to make my own grilled chicken salad.   Bottom Line: The drive through is notoriously slow.  So slow, my co-workers and I sometimes go to Wendy's for our fast food fix.    The people can be nice...others sort of out of it.    TIP: Check the bag before you drive away from the window.  Chances are you won't have the right dressing, a straw, or something is incorrect.
4	ag91e5Gy3q5nWAShruyLOg	I love this place.  It's in the same strip mall as the Fry's I am now going to and also Ace Hardware, Anna's Linens and a few other places I buy stuff at when needed. I go on Saturday mornings at 11 when it opens - which is in half an hour from now, lol - there is a bartender named Monica in there, she is the bomb. She makes GREAT margaritas and I have no problem at all with the food there.  I try something different every time and I haven't been disappointed yet.  The service is good and the wait staff is very attentive.
4	M6yN3EjtLxYCR58w4UCHw	Monty's is a Madison favorite.  Breakfast all day.  Fantastic comfort food.  Friendly service.  Veggie options.  While nothing spectacular, it's consistently pretty damn tasty.  Of note: popular breakfast (expect to wait) and the Meatloaf of the Gods.
4	OniuTjr6Ti4qD3x4grqZ5Q	I'm kind of tempted to give this place 5 stars for the memories, but 4 I guess will suffice.  The only thing I ever really got there was the baked mostaccioli, and it was soooo delicious and so so so so cheap ($5.95 for a full, which is definitely more worth it than the half for a dollar cheaper or so) and they give you such a big portion that it lasts you days and days and it still tastes so good when you microwave it up!!  Their garlic bread's not the best, but it's edible and again, I can't stress how much I love that baked mostaccioli!!!!
4	8dr8khEelDpvnCrvS3uww	I went to this Hooters on my first Vegas trip... the cabby had no idea where the hell it was located and neither did we, I got in the cab and said take me to Hooters!  (obviously this was before the Casino opened by the strip)  About four of us girls came out here for lunch which was great and it wasn't anywhere near busy in there...   I got a seriously cute hoodie that says welcome to fabulous hooters as a pun on the vegas sign... and it has dice on the sleeve... (I have a dice fettish)... I had a great time and they were having a clothes sale.. who could ask for more??
2	bWVB6FGhvpoHlkkjg85O2g	I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.
2	M7Bj4CfhGamt9yRFRIg0IQ	I'm quite disappointed. Reading the other reviews made me curious to try this place out but it is nothing compared to pho in Maryland. My bowl didn't have much noodles and the soup itself barely stayed hot for long. I wouldn't suggest this place for those who have actually had authentic pho before.
2	CxTtd0GD0h27FXPjpZiwKw	I live very near down town Glendale and have always wanted to try their pizza, well last week I finally did. The fact that it was empty should have told me something. I have to say that it was no better than pizza hut, dominos, or other chains. The salad was not exactly fresh, the dressing tasted funny. The pizza had a great crust but that is all I really liked. Will not be returning...
2	RgntE06BARMhEcmvpk9OwA	I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland.  Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try.
2	QoRn9OVFxs6IlSup6KsBxw	Paid more than I wanted to but didn't want to deal with rude third-world counter people at fast food restaurants nearby at 11 pm.  Got Portuguese sausage links (a first for me..it was good)....biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs....it was only less than 10 minutes from order to serve but eggs and biscuits and gravy were both lukewarm.  It was almost $20 total....I got cheese cake free with coupon from hotel book....it would have been $4.95....for a piece about the size of a hockey puck.
2	6x5c8D32QRrmyF8SHV2g	Very very mediocre sushi in tiny portins with slow service.  This only gets two stars because of the happy hour special.  Head elsewhere for sushi.  Takumi is better and Muramoto is much muich better.
2	Q3CJhKrR79KKJmuP5BN0Lw	Sorry to rain on this one, but I was very disappointed by my meal.  I'll do anything to avoid chains, so this place really sounded good ... but it was not to be.    I LOVE Bruschetta, but their bruschetta was disappointing.  The bread was nothing special, and there was a lack of good tomato/basil on top.  There was a big dollop of goat cheese, which sounded good on the menu, but ended up not contributing much.  My steak salad was not bad (the grilled steak was good quality, and nicely cooked - something many places get wrong) but the croutons were the typical pathetic specimen you'd expect at Denny's.    Overall, I found the menu confusing and the descriptions unappetizing. For example, there's a 'pasta' section, with this entry: "Love me Tender ...  Filet mignon, in gorgonzola cream sauce with spinach, mushrooms, green onions and roasted red bell peppers"   Now - how does a 'filet mignon' end up as a pasta dish? Is the pasta on the side? Is the filet all chopped up and tossed in with the pasta?  Beats me!  And the photos on the menu don't have captions so you have no idea which dish they are portraying.
4	ofPRpekYoS52ayccMuhOIg	Good food. A tad steep in price, but not horrible for the service level. Best to go in late spring/summer though, otherwise it's chock full of snowbirds in there. It's in the older part of town, so the neighborhood is a little sketchy for such a nice place.
4	DouA2bp0Rei3hHqbbPQ	I love that this Denny's is categorized as a gay bar! Perfectly nicknamed Jenny's, this chain diner is located in a known gay district of Phoenix, so you can imagine my disappointment when my wife and I walked in for breakfast on a Monday morning and discovered a totally normal Denny's! Where were the drag queens and disco balls and the loud techno music? Ok maybe I wasn't really expecting all that... regardless, it had been ages since I've been to Denny's, and not much has changed. The service is slightly above average and the mediocre food is an amazing hangover cure.... however the prices have gone up at some point during the last 6 years.... guess that's inflation for you. We both crushed the Grand Slam breakfast and overtipped our waitress, who was impressively a bilingual white chick! We will definitely be back!
4	fXOCs2KM16czYWGf7y21PQ	some of these reviews really make me laugh.  This is not a place to go if you're expecting authentic Asian food. You can tell the moment you walk in that doorway.. The loud music and ambiance is to attract a certain target group. It's not meant for everyone.  For what they are they are pretty good, best time to go is happy hour, otherwise it might not be in your price range. I happen to like the people who work there too.
4	FFka0xUxgqxf4jcCsw	You know when you go on vacations...you try to check out the local places and restaurants...right? Well, don't ask me why the other parties on my vacation trip wanted to go safe and dine here. And worse, on New Year's Eve!!!!   And on New Year's Eve, this place was pretty much quiet with few tables occupied.  So, waitservice was friendly and attentive.  Despite my disappointment with hanging here on New Year's Eve, food was surprisingly good.  Hey, anything with Jack Daniel's in the food is bound to make it delicious!  If only TGIF wasn't so dark inside, everything would have been just right.  Turn up the lights a bit.  Not all of us are hideous looking, ya know.
2	OweBFSplh8TTI13CqzFRg	I went here for a meeting a few weeks ago and from the moment I got there, I could tell the staff wanted to be anywhere but at work that morning. Maybe it was also the company I was there with, but I felt like I should be about 80 to enjoy. Not that there is anything wrong with being 80, but I don't need to feel that way, yet! I ordered a Cesear salad because there's not a lot of vegetarian dishes. It was blah. Nothing to write home about. Like others have said, I got out of there paying $20, but I got a sad salad and a diet coke. It's on a lake, cute, but it's not a place I will go back to.
2	1Vj5TC1pSl1C4xdMSlm5w	I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the "chain" expectation.   I order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.  Fortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly.   I'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.
4	CyjS7870HcdOC5T4pVthAQ	I had almost stopped eating Pizza because it was so difficult to find really good Pizza anywhere in Virginia.  When I relocated to Phoenix and a friend recommended Fatso's I didn't expect to find Pizza I could love again!    The thin crust is perfect, the cheese not too greasy or too salty and the pepperoni is cooked just right for me.  I like it crispy like bacon.  The green peppers are fresh and the sauce tasty.  Can't ask for more than that!    I've eaten in a few times and the service has been sporadic.  My first time the service was fast and attentive, the last time just the opposite.  The waitress seemed to have better things to do.  The times in between were nothing memorable so the service must have been adequate.   The live music is fun and they change musicians enough to allow for conversation in between singers.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the sporadic service.
2	whj9rJNJ3BJ0YJExjG0bow	I really do not like anything about this place. The inside of the building is depressing with horrible little tables and chairs. I do not even remember the folks working there so they must have been ok as they did not doing anything wrong. The food to me tastes like it comes out of a TV dinner, yet folks eat here and it stays open year after year so someone likes it.
4	425m6eezGxLT0jWlSMa5VA	Last night I was really craving some Chinese food and wanted something a bit more upscale than the usual places we go (Ginbu and Taipei Express, to name a few), so we headed to PF Chang's. Normally I try to stay away from chains like this and go to local places, but Charlotte isn't known for its stellar ethnic food and I knew I'd like the food at PF Chang's.  The Mongolian beef seems to be popular among other reviewers and I have to agree. It's pretty delicious. My boyfriend had the shrimp fried rice, which was also good. Our server was really pleasant and helpful. All in all, it was a good dining experience. And I had enough left over to eat Mongolian beef for lunch today.
2	fZQA3NQZDmathk4utmTfA	not a creative name and the restaurant isn't good either.  I ordered the steak and eggs for 6$ and didn't finish it.  This is a good place to head to if your staying at the monte carlo and is hungry at 4am in the morning, however i wouldn't recommend going somewhere else though.
2	1mYqkG9j4NCP9RpR6RbNw	oh boy, where should i start? first of all the prices are wayy too high for a place that doesnt get much business, it smells strange inside(every time), the russian woman at the front is rude and dumb, its quiet in the restaurant part b/c nobody is ever there(4 people at the most @ once), they have good mongolian beef, orange chicken is too soft, but good. It's just way too high for what it is and the place isnt flattering!
2	8qr8RjREz55fcMTDIOmRJQ	I've been to this Denny's a couple of times and its been consistently just OK.  The staff is a bit frazzled during busy times so double check your order and be prepared for stuff missing. The food is Denny's, what can I say. Its filling inexpensive and if u become a member you get 20% off coupons regularly. So that's good. Really, its a diner...I've been to better...I've been to worse....have at!
4	A7ctbl5Pd4r7ygsl5bkNUg	When my waiter came to my table to take my order and barley spoke English, and Spanish wasn't his first language either, I knew I was in heaven. The staff seems to be fresh off the boat and it shows. I am a huge fan of tutti santi. Probably top 5 Italian in the valley.
4	FBSfMvqlcdkh3KTqyGzIsg	My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.  We were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).  About 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.  The food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't).   For dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, "how are we going to eat all this?" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.  Last but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...  All in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again.
4	VrJKuneiU6OHR0sw9jLfQ	Very well managed.  On the better end of the chain.  9 times out of 10 GREAT, efficient, friendly, service.  Can't beat fish taco Tuesday's $1.25 per taco.    Excellent fresh salsa options.  I rotate between the hot salsa and chipotle, add some fresh onions and chives.  Food always well prepared.  Great for take out they always hook it up fast and fresh.  Dining in they have bottles of beer on ice.  Decent indoor/outdoor seating.  Kept clean enough.
4	SYRR57uatdtTQN0ztYxw	Tasty food at a decent price. Nice local alternative to paradise bakery. Today they had reggae music playing on Muzak.  Not enough seating, and the place was packed when I got there, but otherwise pretty good chow.
4	jpXKxPRhMXJwxeY6JBzjQ	I have been going to this restaurant for years.  It has maintained it's quality even when it has changed owners.  There is a funky lady there that has worked there for a long time-17 Years? She always remembers you and makes your experience more fun.  Always good food, Always good service. It is a fun little place to go but won't impress someone who is more interested in "atmosphere" than in good food and company. This city could use more small restaurants like this that just don't follow the norm.  Speaking of following the norm.  You do need to check when they are open.  Their hours are a little different. It is well worth making a trip to this little place when they are open.    (I usually go there when I am planning on going to the Sprouts in the same center.  I can walk off a few calories after I'm done with dinner!)
4	UUibx7Fe5MvfUxSmOlqB5A	I am a bone-fide coffee snob. I hate Starbucks, so when I moved two blocks south of Grinders, I was giddily giggling all the way to the register... Not literally, 'cause people would stare. However, it has been nearly a year and the only coffee item I have tried is the Viennese. Am I really just a creature of habit, or is this coffee filled with nicotine? It's delicious, anyway. Get it!   I like the names of their sizes, it's cute and I take it as a jab at Starbucks, which pleases me immensely. The atmosphere is very "living room", with local art they sell to customers, comfy couches, and tables that have seen lots of use. Their patio is getting nicer now that it's cooling off, and usually the baristas if they aren't too busy will walk your coffee or drink of choice out to you.  They roast their own beans, and sell them to you in cute little paper bags! Mum loves the Heavenly Bliss, it's not too acidic like some roasts are, and has an amazing aroma when it's going through the coffee machine, plus it isn't too pricey for in-house roasted beans, which can often get expensive. I live close enough to hear their live bands play when I'm out and about, and they're usually good falling in to the Blues category, A few friends say it's definitely worth the trip over there to check it out!
4	f67FQNqx5Ts67mnZfyhA	pretty average mexican food, with a large cantina area atttached that becomes a club of sorts on the weekend.  to be honest, i've been here three times in as many years. with casa reynosa and rosita's so close, i tend to opt for them over this place.
2	eqrSz4mtQzgzmnQU5zpgfg	Staff was slow. The guy at the counter didn't understand the concept of a coupon and charged us regular price. We didn't bother with arguing over it because there was a line building behind us. The location isn't the best location. A lot of people that came in wanted to use the restroom but knew the rule of having to purchase something in order to use the facilities. Next time I crave chicken I'd go to a different location.
2	LRFQWmp1sPN0VJtnxopTg	Was not impressed with this restaurant....  We came here for dinner on a Saturday around 5:30pm and this place was dead!  There was one couple sitting at the bar when we walked in, and another couple who sat in back of us right before we left. I am picky when it comes to sushi, so I ordered the 3 item combo plate with California roll, chicken katsu and gyoza. I hate to say it, but that was probably one of the worst combo plates I have had at a Japanese restaurant! The chicken katsu was falling apart and hard to eat, the California roll pretty much had no taste, and the gyoza tasted like the frozen kind that I could buy at the market and make at home. On the other hand, my husband liked his Las Vegas roll and another roll which I can't remember the name. Guess I should have just ordered sushi!   Prices are on the high side, our bill was about $60.00! The sushi rolls ranged from $12-$16 and I believe the combo plate was $18.95. Customer service was okay. The servers did their jobs, but they weren't overly friendly or anything. If I ever do come back here, I will order their sushi and definitely try their desserts!
2	0KZAUHDHt1ykqOSwGpGlGA	I went to this airport foodery with thoughts of getting a great Oaxacan meal at Sky Harbor Airport. But that was a fantasy. Not sure why I ever thought that, maybe it was just the Oaxaca name.  This is burritos to go. I ordered a Machuca Oaxaca burrito, Machuca being shredded beef mixed with onions and chilis.   The Burrito was surprisingly small. I agree with Eli's first review. It was not that tasty, and it was real watery or wet. I went through 10 napkins, because everytime I squeezed the burrito by taking a bit, a puddle appeared below the burrito. It got to be irritating, as I didn't want greasy stains on my clothes, so I was trying real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldn't leak from the bottom.   It still leaked. After every bite. A little puddle I would wipe up with yet another napkin.   The chili sauce was spicy, and was perhaps the best thing about the food.   Machuca Burrito and drink totalled $8.53.  I hate to admit it, but It made me crave for Chipotle!
4	QzhHNCEVW5wyhni7XLcmjw	We were impressed with Golden Gate.  We started with an order of Crab Angels.  $4.50 for 6.  They were plump and the filling had a much higher mixture of crab than most Chinese restaurants provide.  We shared House Fried Rice, Triple Seafood Delight and House Special Chicken.  The fried rice had chicken, beef and shrimp.  The rice alone I would give 3 stars.  The seafood delight lived up to it's name.  I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.  My daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  Nice touch and very tasty.  Our total bill was about $38, a great deal for the quality and quantity of service.  An appetizer, fried rice and 2 entrees shared among 4 people and we brought home 3 boxes of leftovers.
4	eD8pDeBf3gDLglQDoMzaAQ	Warning:  Do not wear a white shirt.  Continuing to scour the valley for Chicago food, I stumbled on A&J.    *stares at sign*  "Chicago Style Bar B Q"     hmmm.  I lived in Chicago almost my entire life, and I have no idea what this means.  I've heard of Chicago style hot dogs, pizza and beef and KC & Memphis style BBQ, but never Chicago style BBQ.    First thing you notice are the smells- Oh the glorious smells- that hit you from the parking lot.  It's a pretty simple place, really.  Slow cooked pork, beef, chicken and ribs.  Take your pick, it'll be slathered in tasty BBQ sauce.
2	R0Z7xseOQF5GmxoyTsUiHQ	The reason they are so expensive is because this location is a franchise. It's always been on the high side in terms of prices. Food is kind of on the average ground, and while convenient for a location, they should realize their high prices won't help them whatsoever. Haven't gone to this location in years, but I'm not surprised they haven't lowered their prices.
4	Yh8UCCEhBAkKnyUzyGN59Q	My friend and I went here when I came to visit him in Phoenix and it's one of his fave mexican joints to eat at. They have a really cool bar area and two huge big screen tv's featuring the latest sports event (phoenix suns game when i was there). The drinks are pretty good, we had some beer and girly drinks (strawberry margarita and mojitos) which tasted not so bad and the fresh chips and salsa were kept us from going hungry while we waited for our actual food (the service is really slow). I had some chicken taquitos and shrimp tacos were which came with rice and lettuce. I thought the food was pretty good, but I don't know how authentic it is. I'd still go here again as long as I had some friends with me
4	2o68fjO5Hh9FosLfIB8Kg	Student and Early Bird (before 6pm) specials on weekdays (not including Friday) - steak (or pork or fish) and all you can eat salad bar for ~12$. Awesome!  This is the place to go for your steak fix on a student budget.
4	KYL9tkNounNOrggYAlvScw	I zoom. I zoom, I walk fast, I multitask - every movement I make is planned for efficiency. Therefore, Jason's Deli is my lunch spot of choice and here is why. I can just walk up to the salad bar kiosk, touch the screen a few times, slide my card and walk two steps to where a smiling person hands me my plate and cup. Quick. I have waited in line maybe one time even when the sandwich line is out the door.  Jason's salad bar is the best I have found. The ingredients are always fresh and the selection is good. Yes I am a fan of Jason's in Pineville.
2	YqmbIdqUoCNbCGAQyCSHkg	Even Am Lee has been around for a long time but it is not an authentic  or real Chinese cuisine.Itis more like an American version of Chinese food. Even though restaurant uses quality meat in the dishes,the food taste terrible.I am so disappointed. Apart from that food are so expensive. I do not mind paying for food as long as they are good.  If you have been to this place ,you can see that not so many Asian person eat there,only American(no offence) love this place.
2	mmQGTMdxq9H3o147VGV5g	I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed.   First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble?   Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it!   Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.
2	6CljkzOA4aM7Jg3Z6UZig	Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing.  We each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order.   The service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said "Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink." What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard "$5.00 well drinks" or anything normal like that. It's basically "order something and hope it's on our happy hour specials."  Rather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service.
2	bsz1XEDcgLoJK5m3pfLJw	This place is way overpriced, as far as the steakenburger part goes.  Bread's meh, the philly steak is meh, all in all - meh...  But very overpriced.  Think 8 bucks for a steakenburger (burger with philly meat as well) fries and drink.
4	AvfPXz60BCRPVGK4lcTLag	Very conveniently located at the top of the Blue Line, just a short block and half over to Tryon, you can't miss the Rock Bottom facade. I was meeting a friend for a semi-business lunch, so I wasn't able to try any of their house brewed beers (they server Kaliber, but they don't have their own non-alcoholic beer). The back of their lunch menu is all booze - 11 different martinis and 4 different margaritas and a whole bunch more. Definitely a full bar here!  I had read over the previous Yelpers before going, so I had one of their salads - the Goat Cheese and Hummus. It was a huge scoop of hummus (at least a cup, maybe more) with a dressing tossed salad on top of sliced flatbreads. Way too much food, the hummus was sharp and tasty with just enough garlic that it was delicious but not so much that I was worried about my breath heading back to the office. Maybe there could have been more goat cheese, but that's just me complaining because it was good!  My friend had some sort of cheese topped grilled chicken with fries. While it was good, I absolutely won the competition. ;-)  A very pleasant experience. I'd have no problem going back here if I'm Uptown.
2	BwQVG5H6QXThOiRHoc6iPg	The menu has remained basically the same since Baby Kay sold the restaurant late last year.  The food is not as good and it is my understanding the new owners dismissed Chef Lou-Lou, no wonder the food sucks. The restaurant is not as clean and the food is terrible. What a waste!!! If anyone knows of a real good Cajun restaurant let me know!
4	iJLHNLk1uOqLn8JQJtWvfw	I've always loved the outback and this one is my favorite location I always do curbside never go inside and our order has been wrong a couple times well over a year ago but they gave us a GC for there error and the next meal was on us. We go there often enough to be regulars.
4	g9vp9mdcEE3QZPV7vclMQ	$0.99 tacos - generously sized and very tasty.  The fact that you can sit down at this price is amazing - who cares about the lack of decor.  To top, service was very friendly.     We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  Lamb's the weekend special so we order the lamb soup and the grilled lamb taco.  The shredded lamb in the taco tasted more boiled than grilled - we surmised that this was the reason for the tasty lamby soup.    We ordered a few tacos and liked the al pastor the best.  The dry-rubed spices had completely infused into the meat which combined with the smokiness of the charcoal grill made it one of the best al pastor we'd had.  Also liked the horchata - most places make it too sweet - this one was just right allowing other flavors to come through.  If you want more details, Seth has a great review with pictures on his blog "Feasting in Phoenix": http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=223
4	G4bmfd4qSz5CklfktI0Fug	Tonight, we ordered from here for the second time. We had take out both times. They are very quick, which makes the food nice and hot. I enjoyed every bite both times. In addition to being hot, the dishes I've had were very flavorful. We've tried multiple dishes including beef with broccoli, sweet & sour chicken/pork, General Tso's chicken, & chicken with vegetables. We were happy both times and plan to go in the future.
2	XpWJixJQoYzKYsCFmiQnXw	Just had the panang tofu for lunch, and was crazy underwhelmed.  Tiny portion, very watery sauce, and just no *zing* at all to the flavor.  The wait staff was slammed by a half-full restaurant, so things like a coke took ten or fifteen minutes.  This trip was bad, even for the price.
2	Lstdk9pyXYVHoBbAVtOZCg	yuck.  i think Topper's is pretty gross.  Def the cheapest (quality wise) pizza in town.  They do have a varied menu and are open very late, but i wouldn't eat most of the things on the menu.  I guess the food appeals more to drunk college kids than to me, but if you're ordering food at 3 am, it's likely that the quality you are expecting is below par.  If you go for a cheese pizza you should be ok, but you'd be just as well off with a frozen pie from the grocery.
4	AlB6WTrib38w46q9kaXaA	Who would Yelp about Red Lobster? I'm going to! Sometimes, the biscuits, crab legs, and fried goodies on the menu are what's called for.   I've been going to this location for about 20 years. The menu is the same as the others, but I've come to find out that this particular Red Lobster is a favorite child in the chain. Consistency and quality of the food are under a microscope here and the service is held to a high standard.   They know what they are doing here. I'll go back.
4	VVGAvrQO0BHKPTlGW0nvg	Rocker decor and heavy eye-lined waiters & waitresses catering to sports and metal fans converge at this great sports bar and restaurant. Like the iconic compilation of Run DMC and Aerosmith's Walk this Way, Alice Cooper's Town is the best of both world -- sports & rock!   The food is home-style grub referenced by sports & rocker namesakes like the "Tom Brady" burger, "The Big Unit" hot dog (3 feet!!) and the "Megadeath" meatloaf. I had their "Dan's" turkey burger, and I must say it is one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had!    If you want a fun place to go for happy hour, before or after a game, or just to chill and watch sports, Alice Cooper's Town is the place to go.
2	ZdJVrYxEgGGwZpvG9OxCg	Wait, is this a joke? I feel like I'm five years old again with my menu on the placemat. How come I don't get the free box of crayons?   Wait, there are only like three things to choose from? Pizza, Calzone, Salad. Seriously?   Wait, how come there's no sauce on my pizza and the crust is so thin there are holes in it? Why does the chicken taste like rubber?  Went here on new years eve and the atmosphere was like a freakin' funeral home. Lots of stuck up scottsdale people drinking Robert Mondavi wine and acting very proper.   Next time I want pizza I'll be at Domino's.
4	vXoIwlq9765VtRXD5PEbKQ	I've been about a half dozen times for the food, which is pretty good.  Not superb, but pretty good... with your standard mariscos fare -- I seem to always get their campachana, but the fried tilapia is good, too.    I discovered it about four years ago when I first came to Vegas as a tourist and didn't want to eat on the strip.  What is a treat are the mariachis who are here in abundance, especially on the weekend.  Reminds me of the affairs I used to see in East LA -- all locals all the time and families in abundance.  I was here once where I think they had no less than four FULL mariachi bands going one after another and typically they have at least one group playing, walking about.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, next to a small strip mall, and with nothing significant about it; but trust me... it's worth going to at least once.
2	TSC03H5UGCZvUzq2ud87FQ	Food is decent to good.  I have gone there three times for take out for my staff and the orders were completely screwed up three times and when I our someone else tried to correct the order they were incompetent or hostile.
2	hRKBaFnMNHjf76znNm0CSA	Wow, Daren says this place has the best orange chicken and I don't know if I could find him to be MORE WRONG.  No offense to Daren, he's a good guy with good reviews but this chicken was terrible.  It looked and had the texture of calamari - NOT chicken.  The sauce they drown the things in was excellent but the texture of the chicken was disgusting.  I couldn't possibly ever go back here simply because of that.  I'll stick with China Chili's orange chicken, thank you.
2	8Lq9a5vsO56I9RBinQ1bMg	So I went here this weekend with my family and my in laws. It was Saturday and they were pretty quiet to tell the truth.  We had a sweet waitress but she kept trying to upsell and it sounded so scripted and honestly it was pretty annoying after the thirds time. MY father in law fell for it though and ordered an appetizer.  Overall the food was ok, it was pretty hot. My hubby ordered a side salad and it was so small, it was like a handful of lettuce, He said his potatoes and veggies were so salty he didn't eat much. I had  sliders and fries, the fries were nice and crispy, but overall it was just ok.  Its not a place I would choose to eat out, but its ok in a pinch....
2	WvufLXlwCxnAJy3KsOORQ	This food court is actually inside the Casino Royale.  2 stars only because it's your standard Subway but you have to pay almost 3x as much to get the same thing.    I guess that's what happens in Vegas.  But still.
4	XKBYvCRnGJZLk4dlPTre6A	My family and I really enjoy eating here.  Where else can you play with your food and not get in trouble?  Don't forget to purchase your doggy bag before you leave the register ($0.50)!  Trust me, you'll need it.    Yummy Asian food that you can make anyway you like!  Make sure to use more meat than you think you have if its your first time.  It is afterall the amazing shrinking meat.  Lots of choices in meat, vegetarian options, noodles, and sauces.  Once your plate is cooked, you can head over to get some rice or ice cream too!  This meal typically last three days for us.  And for $10!  The only reasons it did not get 5 stars from me is it isn't always quick service at the cooking stations and buffet area tends to get messy if not frequently checked on.  But it is a buffet, so I guess that is expected.
2	Wnj5rxQS5ud8Mj6op5AHg	Don't go through the drive through. They F you in the drive through. Multiple different times throughout 3 years, I have been F'ed consistently. Hamburgers with no meat (hard to validate when driving through). Missing items. Just go in and check your order.
4	q4tqgbDGXC5GZ9goxP6XA	Blurb for iPhone App: Great Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa made fresh, but beans left something to be desired.  Give it a try nonetheless.  I just wrote the last part because I will be on the Yelp app, and notice that I often start my review with something that is not useful at all... which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones.  So I guess you could say I'm optimizing for mobile.  Ok, now on the full review.    Took off a star for the beans... they just weren't great.  The person with me had a taco salad, and said they didn't get a lot of meat in it... and the rice was good, but not great.  However, this was balanced by the chips and salsa (which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up) which seemed to be made fresh, not too hot, but with plenty of flavor.  The "hot" sauce (hot is entirely objective here) was very good, and I used that for my chips as much as the salsa.  Didn't ask if they had anything hotter, as the true chilehead will think it's pretty mild...  I had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red.. and although I usually like the green better, the red here is great.  One word of advice however - don't step on the scale the next morning, because you are going to stuff yourself while you are here.
4	0okvZHrhuBzR2MELBqTA	I haven't been here in about ten years, but I used to go to it frequently.  Needless to say I enjoyed there food and atmosphere.  It's not like those hole in the wall 'authentic' Mexican food restaurants you'll find in central and south Phoenix, but it has good food and service.
4	1DG8IbYTnUVHeWiKt063ag	Oh so good, so so good. I've been looking for good Thai food ever since traveling through Thailand last year. This place really hit the mark.  The Laarb was fantastic and quite spicy, just the way it should be. It was presented really beautifully with cabbage leaves and sprigs of mint leaves. I ordered the Red Curry with mixed vegetables and shrimp. Yum. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and the curry was delicious.  Mangoes and sticky rice for dessert too. I can't wait to go back.
2	iKN81XzXjuSQSy09i9zdBw	Heavy sauces, bland dishes and so-so service.  I really wouldn't call Olive Garden an Italian Restaurant, its a chain that serves Americanized  dishes loosely based on recipes that might have an Italian ingredient or two in them.  The soup was cold, our food was served lukewarm and the service was slow.  I suppose if you only ordered the salad and bread-sticks it might be worth going to.  It's sad because the menu items sound good but they are just so poorly executed it's just not worth wasting your time here.
4	WfAJCqp7op68f4WC3nHyQ	Always love Eat'n Park. This one's right in my neck of the woods so I go here frequently. Food's cheap, tastes good. I'm a big fan of their Bananas Foster Smile and their French Toast Smile. I like to get a cup of fresh fruit with it as well. Waiters are always super nice and attentive, I always have a fine ol' time at this Eat'n Park.   Smiley Cookies have always been pretty bland admittedly but I have a soft spot for 'em so I like to pick one or two up when I can for a little treat.
4	BtEMFwtFlKgDj1idAlidDg	i haven't been to Carrabba's in years and i've missed it so much!  we went the other night and everything was fantastic!  there were a couple of hiccups early on, but nothing at all major.  the calamari was nice and crispy, but not overly-breaded.  i ordered the linguini pescatore (minus scallops) and while the sauce wasn't as spicy as i recalled, the shrimp was FANTASTIC!  normally i take the shrimp out of my dishes and donate them to the rest of the table but not this time.  succulent meaty delicious.   and the service was pretty fabulous, too!  i felt bad for our server because my uncle had her box EVERYTHING and the wee one kept trying to talk to her.  she handled everything graciously and never missed a beat.   we will definitely be back.  definitely the best italian restaurant at their price-point.
4	ym0iZcD3p3lXI0Q3iyTNA	This place is good when you want to get a salad made your way and some other healthy choices. The service is pretty good and I personally enjoy the drink selections.. The pomegranate green tea is amazing. It is slightly like the chain fresh choice in northern California except sweet tomato has fewer choices. There is not a lot that can be said about this place, you serve yourself and they clear your table. So far... good job.
2	3o4i1CocXt0txP89GFxRvQ	I love plain cheese pizza. I love a crunchy yet soft crust, good melty cheese, and a not-too-sweet sauce. Napoli had all three, but where they fell short, which surprised me, was the taste of the crust, it was way too salty. I don't know if it was because it went bad or they didn't measure the salt correctly but I was very disappointed. I loved everything else about the pizza so I hope this was a one-time thing. I will give them another chance but I will buy a single slice next time instead of a whole pie.
4	jUnNaaC8QH2bYVSECfRw	Service has always been excellent. usually i go there just by myself but sever always pays a lot of attention to me. I am not a big fan of their steaks - i think they are not tender enough and a bit chewy. but the rest of the menu is amazing! try parmesan shrimp or their pasta bowls. 2 for 20$ including an appetizer - who doesn't love that? thei garlic mashd potatoes loaded with sour cream are very good too.
4	EQSQ4X1x7FUgHVW6lLO9nw	Great pizza at a reasonable price. Picked up take out pepperoni and cheese. Only down side to picking up the pizza was that there was not a separate line for pick up and people ordering slices/pies in the restaurant. However, once through the line they were very friendly and my pizza was fresh out of the oven into the box before my eyes! Delicious and cheap! Will be back.
4	ytZMjhiokk1GUKC4EkskoQ	I love this place. It looks nice and very clean on the inside. I've been here a couple times with my girlfriend and we both love it. I had the sukiyaki and my girl had the beef teriyaki. Both of them were really good, especially hers. I have to say that the salad with the Japanese house dressing is amazing as well.
4	4I9rqi5vfQTr92vApyFHkw	I Have nothing but lovely things to say about Bruegger's and the team of people that work at my 'go to bagel shop'. The bagels are fresh and they usually have hot bagels right out of the oven and a wide variety to choose from. I usually don't stray away from my personal favorite everything bagel with an odd combination of two cream cheeses.The light garden veggie and lox cream cheese are both delish. If you're looking for something different you  try the jalapeno cream cheese.  Everyone from Mary who usually rings me up to the guys who make the bagels. I like the different types of bagels and spreads.   The place is always clean and there are a few tables and booths.  Whenever I'm craving a carb-filled breakfast on the run I grab a bagel and my day starts off well!  $2.50 for a cream cheese bagel, my coffee is more!
4	GMPBF8adNLbLX2WcguTKg	Laid back place. I had the best carnitas tacos ("mexicano style" soft corn tortillas, lime & cilantro) but honestly, some of the worse rice & beans I've ever had....skip those. And the sour cream comes in the little packages like you would get at Wendy's or something....The complimentary chips and salsa were great, and the staff friendly and attentive. Pretty decent food overall. We had a party of 8 for lunch and surprisingly they accommodated us immediately, but the place filled up quickly, and not all with just college students. FYI-The lunch specials are yummy and a great price-check them out.
4	9jM1ImUkRmZ2PzgbvmEg	Yes, it's a chain. I support local when I can but damn, Papa John's is some good pie.   Ordering a pizza is a 2-person job in our house- one to get the pizza, the other to hold the dog. The drivers are always friendly, though- our regular guy even knows the dog by name and talks to him when he drops by. Delivery is always on time, hot, fresh, and delicious. Both the roommate and I are regulars. (Can I say frequent pie-ers? Is that cheesy?)  I love the online ordering and the daily specials. You also receive points for online ordering. I almost saw Jesus a few months ago when I came home from a 10-hour shift and found out I had enough points for a free pizza. You can also pre-tip when you order, saving me the trouble of having to scrounge up cash.
2	pJCYLeZUtgnx8mDojoS2ng	Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.  I went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.  I don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup.
2	bul8xdqMzyu93cjCWfxA	I want to start off by saying that Chinese food should not have YELLOW Rice!!! They do have good lunch specials and again this Chinese food wasn't very good. Still searching for a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. The only reason why I tried this place because I was next to it at the time. Still searching!
2	PzOe3tbCv7RTOp4ZJxOyw	Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.  Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with "free" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.         Farewell, Flavors of India, farewell!
2	ToB2wGWuWBtGpiuJCwb6ZQ	I want to like it.  But ultimately, it took forever to get and he doused my sushi with various sauces that were NOT listed on the menu.  As a condiment-o-phobic, my sushi was ruined and I didn't feel comfortable enough to request it be fixed.    15$ later, I tossed it and walked out, miserable.
4	8jbcxyJaw7iO2WX9aMkig	I had stopped in to the Prairie Cafe & Bakery several times since it opened to buy scones for the office, and I hadn't really given it much thought beyond this purpose.  I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.  I was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.  After a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.  Maybe one of these days I'll get a chance to try lunch here too.
2	KIfsstIybsdumLmjuoAdPA	Went here on a football Sunday and I was told that the menu was reduced to be quick and more American. This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu, avoiding the burgers and fries... it was good but there are better places and better food. I don't know much about about French food so I was curious. The music was too loud an rappish (or R&B) so, although I dined alone, I would imagine it would be difficult to carry a conversation. The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so I will not repeat.
2	loi2VfGe0hZEY1yLCHOxA	Sweet and sour chicken was good amd it was a very good sized portion. However DO NOT get the the Kung Pao Chicken, when I opened the box it smelled like urine. I'm not exaggerating. There are much better places to order Chinese food from Madison.
4	tdy0fnaq4sJx3KwxQs8ZA	We live very close so we come here regularly. Spicy grilled chicken wings are delish. We also love the beef stroganoff. Service is always good. They have nice happy hour as well as reverse happy hour. Decent patio area when the weather is nice! Seems to be a bit of an older(retired) crowd, probably due to location. BTW, any tips on what they use in the wings?
4	8jiewlvTiizPXtFb4HgEQ	We have eaten here several times and always happy with the food and service. The last time we went everything was off, very dry meat which has never happened before. SO this will not keep me away as it must have been an off day.
4	3GU5TtyDtx8wsrlCVbVsg	Two dogs all the way, fries and a water for around $5.50. Can't beat the prices. I've had the burgers and would rate them as just ok but they are famous for hotdogs so what would you expect. Breakfast is also pretty good.  Definitely worth a try if you've never been there.
4	exI9fbfLerZvvXMg	I've been getting food from Chai Tip's for several years.   They delivered to the hospital the night my son was born and their delivery driver has become a regular at our house.   When given a substandard orange chicken (we ate it all anyways)  we called a week later and were given a free entree.   The family is great and we have no complaints.   While not high cuisine we really like the place.  We recommend it highly.
4	VOSGOrDDcCcr2sIYUAD9Xg	i can only speak about the happy hour food at this restaurant which are all of the appetizers.  i've eaten 1 other time here in the main dining room. ok, during happy hour, the appetizers are 1/2 off. the appetizers are outstanding. you can only get the half off in the bar area, which is also decorated nicely like the restaurant. these aren't ordinary appetizers. there's excellent calamari with a unique dipping sauce, coconut crusted shrimp (large shrimp), an asian flavored chicken & nut lettuce wrap (sizeable amount), and a variety of other appetizers. the appetizers are always good and each are under $4.50. drinks are reduced in price for happy hour. i've always had good food here. the one time i dined in the main area, my meal was large and good quality and was fairly priced. i would give this a big a+ if you are looking for quality appetizers at 1/2 off and sizeable drinks at reduced prices. the main dining area is attractive, different, and they offer alot on their menu.
4	1qNwQNx6bq5gOwflnMsw	I love Del Taco. I don't know why, but they are just yummy to me. I only get their chicken soft tacos. Here is how Dottsy eats a chicken soft taco from Del Taco: Open the taco, pour a packet of INFERNO sauce on the taco, spread guacamole over it, and place 3 or 4 french fries inside the taco. Fold one end, the fold in half and take a BIG MESSY bite! Hey..never knock unless you've tried!  I will say that Del Taco uses REAL chicken pieces and every time I eat there my food is hot a fresh, even the yummy crinkle cut fries. Yes, it's a guilty pleasure, but Del Taco is a step up from other fast food Mexican food. I wouldn't even really consider it Mexican food, it's more Calexican food, a mixture of California and Mexican.  Hit Del Taco for a quick fast food fix, you might be surprised!
4	Oakvu3GPv4V2Vdwqj2MtQ	I came in to get a selection of smoked fish to serve as appetizers for a holiday gathering.  I was absolutely overwhelmed by everything this little store stocks.  Blini, cheeses, sausages.  Beets.  How could they avoid beets?  Chocolates.  And something i haven't had in years. Kasha.  Rhymes with Yasha, who has a huge personality and runs this little empire.
2	dBQ4mN3K7Z5zq75d5Cq9VA	I've been to the California Goldilock(s) and all of them were pretty good, but this one was just BAD.  My boyfriend is white so this was his first experience with a Filipino restaurant, and you know how first his impressions count, right? Oh God, I pity him now. He ordered the bbq chicken, and although it came out nicely browned and glazed on the outside, the inside was COLD and BLOOD RED. The kitchen couldn't even spare a second to check if it was done? Hello, salmonella? It wasn't even all that busy! My mom ordered the chicken adobo rice, which was actually very tasy - except it was served lukewarm. I ordered the palabok which, to my taste, was way too watery! I could've eaten that thing with a spoon!  I would've given them 1 star, but their bakery redeemed themselves. We bought a dozen cheese rolls and they were surprisingly delicious! Nothing wrong with them at all! I would say that they are in close competition with the cheese rolls from Portos in LA.. and that's saying a lot!
2	KUU81RF0sjc9kBqwrFUpg	Pretty lame, even for Casa Grande. Went on a Thursday night when they are supposed to be open until midnight. They apparently decided they wanted to close early because hardly anyone was there, so the waitress told us it was last call at 9:30 even though we had not even been there very long and were clearly planning to stay for the evening. Awesome.  The beer selection is very basic. Maybe two of the taps rise above the level of barely tolerable, for anyone who's into flavorful beer. But, I guess that's a function of their clientele more than anything else. I'm not a beer snob by any means, but give me something more than light domestics.
4	xY2gjy49dnpQSB2RTZzqCw	This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back.
4	ciSJXF7LQ4UH9b8dDyyxrg	Ive been to a few Hooter restuarants and have not been impressed, but I have to say this one changed my mind. We had a group of 25 people so at first I didnt expect the service to be all that great, but I was pleasantly surprised with the great service we had. The ladies were very friendly, fun, and attentive. We had a fun crowd so Im not sure if that help open up the fun atmosphere and the waitresses. We all cracked jokes and they welcomingly chimed in, making for a fun experience .  As far as food goes, it was actually pretty good. First I had the naked hot wings that lived up to the hype. They were very good. Then I had the bacon chesse burger which was good as well.  All in all my experience here was fun and memorable.
2	lbsksSjgdoc9HW2w5bovg	I went here a while back and I forget what kind of sandwich I ordered but the guy put my meat in what looked like dirty dish water before whisking it away for whatever was the next step. I never went back.
4	OJ3hFt5u9MlLLESFFuFg	I've only been here once, but this place impressed me. The service was a bit slow, but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty. Well, the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup, but the katsu don served over rice was....I've never had better katsu don. I would eat it again. Most sushi restaurants I've gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans, but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner. Definitely recommend it.
2	aDi0xhrqGz0hoTtv2nvJQ	I am torn about this place. Here's thing, there's the good and the bad.... I guess I'll be a bummer and start with the bad...  First, I've eaten almost everything on their menu, including all the breakfast items and items that are not on the menu.  After working downtown for so many years, I eat here at least once a week.  Does it mean that it's so great that I'm addicted to their food?  No.  It just means there's not much else around.  Choices are limited downtown and this is one of the better eats.    The bad... I find this place to be dirty.  My friends know that I try to stay away from the salad bar.  It's not the food that's the issue but their plates.  It's plastic and they don't wash it very well.  Next time you eat at the salad bar, check underneath some of the salad plates, you'll see some grease.  Yeah totally gross huh?  I hate all their dishwares.  It's just plain unappetizing.  Also, depends on what you order, the food can be really greasy.  Most of the breakfast items are totally greasy.  I don't recommend coming here for breakfast.  The breakfast is just okay, I recommend that you save your money and go to Omelette house for some real breakfast instead.  The only good breakfast item are the Argentine pastries.  These are really good and they quickly sell out before the noon hour.  I have always had a love affair for empanadas and these are just okay.  I expected the outside to be greasy but the filling is extremely greasy.  I had them twice and still don't like it.  I don't think I will order these again.    There's always good and bad items on all restaurant menus.  I guess it just depends on each persons preference.  Maybe I've been going to this place for so many years that I just wish they would step up their game and just "WOW" me.  I need a good lunch spot downtown.    The reason why I still go here despite the dirty dishes is really because of one dish.  I can't get it anywhere else and I can't seem to get quite like this.  This one dish, a dish that was created many years ago by the original owner, is simply perfect.  I love the grilled eggplant mozzarella prosciutto sandwich.   It's soft, salty and crispy. The sandwich bursts with flavor and makes one forget that the plate could be kinda dirty.  :)
4	InRMEz03PP9VrURm05pGg	Lunch was good! Made the mistake of asking what was in the Italian combo sandwich though... The reply in a strong NY accent: "Don't ask questions like that when you come to a NY deli" I laughed and ordered the Sandwich. He never told me what was in it but I had a good idea...  This is a nice location and has both inside and patio seating. I decided to sit inside because the patio was pretty crowded. Good buzz in this place. It was fun listening to the guy at the counter greet people.  My sandwich was good and really liked the bread. I will definitely go back and probably try the meatball sandwich next. As I was leaving, I saw the guy making one and it looked pretty good. Rinaldi's definitely has some big balls!?!?!?!!? Wait, That didn't come out right...  Give this place a shot... I don't think you'll be disappointed.
4	7VaweIrTHTnXXhx863ejA	I've driven by this place countless times and finally went in for dinner and was not disappointed at all.  The salsa was super tasty and the food was delicious.  We were eating late around 9:30pm and the rice was still super fresh (a good indicator they're not scraping the bottom of the pan and still keeping the kitchen at full throttle) as well as the rest of our meal.   It looks like a little house from the outside but is pretty big on the inside.  The service was excellent and this will probably be our neighborhood go-to mexican restaurant from now on.
2	JuO9yy6FtwQNzdwpJTCpdA	The food was ok.   They had available tables, and that was the major draw here.  The place was upstairs and out of view.  I didn't read about it before going and didn't know what to expect. They didn't have as great of a selection on the 'brazillian' menu as some places.  The meat was decent.   The sides with the meal were adequate.  It was a fair amount of money to spend for a meal.  I'd say that you should be hungry if you go to get your money's worth.  I've been to better brazillian steakhouses.  This was ok, but nothing special.
4	ogeIgsnRb0FVfRjFtswCFw	Fianlly a happy hour that made me happy.  If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.  $5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.  $5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.  There are other $5 options as well.  $6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun.   There also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.  This happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.  With thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.  I recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal.
2	VgltNlwQpeezuTGFWFwWyg	Hickory Tavern trades out on what the Carolinas use to be and misses the mark on what Charlotte is.  Charlotte is a major city now.  It is still growing.  This new style (this location) is a move in the right direction.  Decor and layout are pluses, but menu selection and service leave a lot to be desired.  Let me re-emphasize the service.  It is not even close to being good.  I have been in this location three times now.  Only once did we have a server with a personality.  None of the times did the food come out in a realistic time frame. Why oh why do I see cooks in the dining room?  Why did it take 25 minutes to get food on a day when they simply were not busy?  Oh, thats right... the cooks are watching TV in the dining room.  I guess the servers are in the back doing their nails.
4	RmaUN4WSHgE0LgC6hhYF4w	A good kept secret. Location is off of I-77 on Sunset....just look for the pig in the yard!  Great food, friendly staff, plenty of room inside, but good for take out as well.  Ribs-great Chicken-great BBQ is great
2	G5lKgNsbm1fQaJsPsklhzQ	Went to Tacos Jaliscos today and ordered Pozole. Was told they were out of it. So I ordered the tacos at $1 each. I ordered 2 de pastor and 2 of lengua. I must say that they were not fresh at all and they did have a TON of cilantro and onion mix on there. I really didn't like the tacos. Now, the drink place next door is really good. Probably won't return unless I try the Pozole.
2	LgkAebFf9n7zZhwSwK08g	With the Jones Market being just a hop, skip, and jump away, I'm not entirely sure how this place stays in business. I mistakenly thought the name "Deli" indicated that they made sandwiches, but sadly they only sell the components to make sandwiches yourself. Not a big deal on it's own.  But nearly all of their merchandize is identical to what you can find at Jones Market, and often at a better price. Plus JM has way more selection, as well as ready-made foods.   This small store reminds me of the "Russian store" offered in San Antonio- very limited, with a  big part of the appeal being the frozen pirogies. The store is clean, organized, and well-lit. But again, the merchandize can be found elsewhere- even the frozen pirogies can be found at Sprouts, same brand, too, though not quite so many varieties/flavors.  There may be a small thing or two this store has that others do not- a specific variety of jam, or maybe a particular brand, but by and large this store does not seem to have anything unique to offer.  Even after reading reviews here, I was a little underwhelmed- and browsing their meat case, it was unclear which of their sausages was the "amazing polish sausage". Might come back because it's so close, but will likely continue patronizing JM as it's only a mile or so down the road.
2	4KQ6W8dfS1sAWDm52DotzA	We have eaten at this Denny's the past two Sundays for breakfast.  Food was good both times.  The service, however, needs help, literally.  This place is UNDERSTAFFED!  It took two hours to eat breakfast this morning for three adults and a child.  I have never had to/a wait upon entering a restaurant not because there were no tables, there were PLENTY of tables?  The small staff could just not get people to tables quickly enough!!!  Everyone was working hard, they just need MORE PEOPLE!!!  We had to wait for a table, then wait for a waitress, then wait a long time for the food to be cooked and served.  We drank TOO much coffee with all this waiting.  The clientele is quite diverse.
4	lfbbDNTCkz7vB8s7TaZsmg	Went here for a Father's Day breakfast.  Besides lunch and dinner, they also serve breakfast all day.  Nice folks, darn good diner food, nice size portions.  Lots of old people come here, but they don't try to mug you in the bathroom or anything like that.
4	UTErt6lWrELb1Dcu9ZDu6Q	Not quite small enough to be a hole-in-the-wall, this bar is packed with regulars.  It is a pretty chill place considering the number of people that come to it on Friday nights especially.  People there are pretty friendly and they are always hosting some kind of event (usually kareoke most nights).  I would say that if you were looking for someplace to go that isn't crazy like the rest of Mill Ave.  then head here!
4	bBHmLeaqk1n9b3W5lAcHQ	This is a good place to go for breakfast or lunch.  I don't recommend their dinner entrees.  I think their pricing is high, but comparable to Coco's or IHop (around the corner).  Overall, very fast service, and hot food.  My favorite is their BBQ Burger.   They have good chili too.  Breakfast is the best -- especially their french toast.  The only negative is the lack of large group seating.  This location has booths, so they cannot put tables together (Camelback and Scottsdale can).  Also, they tend to seat people rather oddly which can leave a large group waiting for a long time.
4	Mx93UcYiUntZzOzpD5vA	Stopped in here today after reading the reviews of others. The ribs are delicious. I also had ham and beef brisket although good there was nothing special about them. I really enjoyed the Old Settler Beans. I am not much of a potato salad person so I took one bite and I was done. My friend found it to be wonderful and ate both hers and mine. I must admit this is some of the best BBQ I have found here in AZ. I will definitely return for the ribs they were tender, flavorful and just all around wonderful.
4	Jx5A9ji3Wp3Ccc7U6bCLA	This place is a bit rough around the edges, but worth the adventure.  They have really good fried food, especially the shrimp.  The prices are decent and they have a bunch of different sauces.  My suggestion is to mix the Louisiana hot sauce with the ranch.  Employ that for all of your dipping delights.  If you are health-conscious or looking for a nice place to eat, then this might not be the place for you.  If you down for greasy goodness in a low-key setting, then this is where you should dine.
4	BsgKKPTA6QtUuadYqTVA	Wish I could rate this place twice. I'd give it two stars for lunch. Wasn't that impressed. Four stars for dinner. Fun atmosphere. Around five o clock is a good time to take kids for them to enjoy the dinner show.
2	DldKsPjJIJXn5JpSI4pmAQ	I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side, service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. That's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night.
2	lBnEeTgA6jHjoxrBgJ1sg	Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!  Me today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized "Asian" food around.  I challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state.
4	tKkluk48NqFz5rakyzY5eA	I got to thinking about Osso Bucco the other day.  My new Dutch Ovens brought this on, I'm kind of obsessed with braised meat right  now. What to braise, how to braise, which pot to use... must be because of the freezing cold temperatures.   Anyway.   A few years back my dad and the evil stepmonster (she's gone now, as in they got divorced, in their 70's, can I hear an AMEN sister?) could not stop talking about Christos.   They would talk about it all the time.   In Oregon.  Like, in the middle of a nice dinner at Jake's.   Weird.  Also, rude.   I just chalked it up to stepmonster's name dropping mental health condition.   No seriously, she drops names all the time. ANNOYING. anyway, ahem.  It was Osso Bucco this, Osso Bucco that, Christos this, Christos that.   So, when I was down there on a visit, post stepmonster,  I made my Dad take me.  It's good stuff.   I don't even eat veal.   But the Osso Bucco rocks.   Everything else did, too. I liked the service, the feel of the place, and I liked the calamari, and the wine. All good.   if you're in Phoenix and you want a good meal, I'd say this is one of the places to go.
2	z7UOQfHoBNbInm8SzbGdwg	Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place.
4	1XELFz6TC7Hvme4MmKRA	AB's as I call it is coming up. They have crazy nighttime events (wii, karaoke, late late night happy hour), which I've not partaken in, but have noticed the ads for  I'm surprised at the lack of love for this location, as me and my Frat frequent this location often (because we like to eat and they are easy/great to set up fundraisers with) and I've never had a bad experience there.   What prompted this review is that I'm currently making chicken gorditas which reminded me of the wonton tacos that are BOMB.COM/AMAZING. I usually get the lunch special for $5.99 and call it a day.   Anyways, ya it's not some crazy hip local place, but it's been consistent and good imho.
4	W1YX2vhOjczTBL8tUmggUQ	One good thing about Vegas is the wide variety of dining options.  And one of them is definitely Sonic Drive-In. I go out of my way to find a Sonic (I have to,since there are none near the Strip). Everything at Sonic is delicious. I wish there were Sonics in Northern California, then I wouldn't feel obligated to visit one every time we're down here.
2	15Mm0xwsFDAcQNo04jTEFg	Went searching for a PT/Sierra Gold near the strip for some late night grub with a buddy a few weeks ago. Almost didn't see this place due to construction blocking alot of that area. I couldn't quite put a finger on it. Best I can explain it is the place had sort of an outdated look, or hadn't been renovated in quite awhile. The bartender was the only person out on the floor. I was surprised it's not very busy for a place so close to the strip but I guess it isn't being it was a weekday night. We got our drinks and ordered my usual gilroy pizza since it was happy hour. It is worth noting that their gilroy here did not include salami or artichokes. The couple other PT/SG I've been to usually has those ingredients on the gilroy. Also, the pizza was slightly undercooked. Instead of the normal cracker thin crust, it was floppy. I'm used to just right to slightly overdone crusts. This visit to a different PT/SG was by no means horrible but it wasn't great either. Service was decent and it did satisfy our late night hunger. Although I might try to find another location next time when wanting my gilroy fix near the strip.
4	71pDMLGIDYWmnQD3N5GAw	Located in the T-4 D gates this is the place to stop for your super large super cheap iced coffee.   I also like picking up a snack or small breakfast sandwich depending on the time of day I am rolling through here.    Having over anticipated the time I needed to get through security I had plenty of time to walk from my C gate to the D gates to pick up something.  I have had no porblems with the service or food quality on the couple of stops I have made at this Wendy's.
2	DzNcqnqfx9LWeoa1bRa2mA	Went here once a few months ago and the 'vibe' was weird to say the least. There was a hell of a LOT of drama between the employees, etc. Note this was in the late morning.   The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because our waitress was decent, a 'good ol' gal' Black lady.
2	Lxc7LGQkfNxWcgzo2fAQ	I want to like the food at Shanghai, I really do, but I just don't.  The lettuce wraps are good if you load them up with sauce, but their other entrees are just okay. Hardly any veggies in their entrees. Tonight the Terriyaki chicken was dry & overcooked, the Honey Chicken was mushy, not crunchy on the  outside (it is fried). They have driven me to cook my own Chinese food.  I'm just from cities that had great Chinese restaurants. Hopefully they will change some of their recipes.
4	elmwY5fnUseo96XGH8hlJg	Sammy's is still the best place in Downtown Pittsburgh to get a good corned beef sandwich.  It's still a little dive hole-in-the wall place across the street from Kaufmann's--ahem--Macy's.  Still as popular as ever with the lunch crowds, but a great place to go for an inexpensive lunch.
4	hwlGj1hNlHk0pmmXOIKiA	Apparently this is another Charlotte secret, and I'm glad I know about it now. Super quick and easy --not a sit-down place--Harper's is great if you're in a rush but don't want to settle for fast-food. It's kinda like a giant salad bar, except on top of salad stuff they have real food: ribs, fried chicken, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, collards, red rice and beans. That sort of thing. Comfort food, but done well and done quickly. You're in and you're out and ready to fall into a food coma.   Great dessert options, too, so save some room to check those out. But honesty, just make a heaping plate of mashed potatoes and pulled pork, and you'll be a happy camper, trust me.
4	0U9GCRTNFlkn72P20kOlkA	Pita pit is great food, that is cooked right when you order it, so you know it's fresh. It's never too crowded, which is good for me, because that means I get the yumminess that is Pita Pit that much faster. :-) Lots of choices that are made to order. My favorite is the chicken Cesar pita. Delivery takes a little while, so it's best to pick up.  It's open late...I think until 3ish.
4	inizGSapKCikgsxANB9Rw	Can't believe I have not reviewed this place. Casellas is a popular lunch place at my work. It is legendary and well known in the neighborhood. My usual here is the Philly Cheese Steak w Onions.. It's sooo good and pretty damn legit. Some of my coworkers like to get it with sauce. I haven't tried it but they are serious fans of it. Also, the chicken salad sandwich is great. It is made in house and you can definitely tell.   Only two cons (and minor ones) is that they are cash only. I don't get to come here as often because of this. Secondly, they don't have soda by the fountain, only in cans. But no worries, 7-eleven is across the street to solve both of those things. Buy your fountain drink and get cash back and you're set to grab a sandwich here after.
2	mkzrgyplFXamVSFKpwZ1A	Rude service and gross coffee, as for the bagels... I'm a New Yorker, so these bagel-shaped bread things being called "bagels" are laughable to me. Also, why are they charging an arm and a leg for basic bagels + eggs, things that are supposed to be cheap?? No, thanks.
2	qmbEbsQ5sbRBnYwUEIMF8Q	I don't know what happened to this place this time but they were not doing a good job with anything that night. It was Halloween and we arrived about 7. We waited about 5 minutes..maybe longer at the hostess stand with no one in sight. We almost left and went to Applebee's. I wish we would have. Finally get seated and there we sit for another 5-10min before they bring us water. The place was empty. We told her we knew what we wanted before she took off again..and we have a todler so we are always close to a temper tantrum. The food arrived and I had ribs w/mashed & corn,  hubby had  steak & baked potato. My ribs were not very good at all. There was not enough sauce so I waited for our server to come back and check on us and she never did. Hubby had to go and find someone. When the sauce came out it was boiling hot. Very weird. Hubby said steak was ok..not as good as it usually is.  We also had to wait forever for the check. I hope they were having an off night..cuz it will be awhile until I try here again. Which sucks cuz I usually love this location.
4	eoTvxV0mCxa9SFeBCbpg	Let's face Phoenix. If you say you'll never dine at a restaurant that exists in a strip mall, you're gonna be missing about 43% of Phoenix restaurants. Cherry Blossom, located in a deliciously skanky strip mall on Camelback is a true gem. Not a hidden gem, however, as I notice it's been yelped frequently and seems to be well received. I'll have to say I wasn't thrilled with my noodle dish, kinda bland. However, the sushi rolls were fantastic. The tempura shrimp in particular was mouth watering. My friends thai inspired soup was so good I almost wanted to dive in so I could simply lap it up with my tongue. But he hit me on my forehead with his spoon so I retreated back to my sushi rolls. Service was first rate. I had a manger meeting and we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and were never hurried and not once did we get the "waiter stink eye". If you've ever been privey to that, ouch, it stings! There were 7 of us and the bill came to about $100 so all I can is "come on down" cuz the "price is right" at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe....
2	XPVK0ZRUyiMTRBJziLiLOw	I'm sorry, but I was not impressed at all with my  experiences at the Salt Lick. I really expected a higher-quality meal.  The atmosphere was all right- nothing special. The large round tables were clean, as was the restaurant as a whole. There were five of us in our group and none had been here before.  We  visited on a Friday, around 2 pm.  There were only a few other diners when we visited.  The waitress was fine.  My entree, the "combination barb-b-que meats" for $15.99, was uninteresting, to say the least.  The macaroni and cheese I chose as a side was not good at all- kinda dry and not very tasty.  Salt didn't help.  The baked potato in its little foil jacket was all right- not much you can do to ruin one of those. The meat was boring; not particularly tasty or memorable.  Long, thin slices with barbecue sauce poured over them.  Not my kind of barbecue!  I like eating the meat off the bone, and I like the meat to have been cooked with the sauce on it.  I wouldn't bother coming back here, and if anyone had a taste for barbecue, this is not the place I'd send them to.
4	b1iaYZuxwHzyDJflTVPGCA	This is a great bar if you have kids.... I know that sounds weird but listen. They have a beach  and tiki bar in the rear with cornhole, beer pong, ping pong, horseshoes etc.... They have a stage out there for live music. Big portions of food for not alot of cash. Becoming a Friday night tradition
2	19YmBfSSaDJqAVExo4LCw	Unfortunately, the live music, great service and food that made Salute rise above the hundreds of other little Italian places in the Valley seem to be gone.  The entertainment created an ambience that just made you want to dine here regardless of everything else.  But on our last visit when we were told they were out of the first two things we ordered, early on a Frid. evening, and they had discontinued another dish we requested, we were concerned.  That was followed by really bad service and an awful meal that we picked at and left.  And I feel bad for this place because they will need to really step it up to make up for becoming a "Goodwill" strip center and I don't think they can cut it.
2	DlRGkCJ66Y8G3yIvFM2MA	Went to eat on a Saturday night since we had a gift card  Had to wait about 25 minutes and was then seated.  It had been a while since I had been at outback and they changed the menu quite a bit  It's obvious that they are trying to cater more towards the steakhouse aspect of their name and getting away from entrees.  I really liked their queensland chicken and shrimp but it's no longer offered on the menu  We ordered he bloomin' onion as an appetizer as my wife and I have always been a fan and it had been a while since we had it.  when it came out, we were pretty disappointed.  It was obvious they cut back on the size of the onion as it was considerable smaller than we had remembered.  Additionally, it was extremely greasy and over cooked.  We ate some of it and had to stop because of how much grease was on it.   For our meal, I decided to get the alice springs chicken and my wife got the chicken and ribs combination.  My chicken breast was disappointingly small and about half the size of a normal chicken breast you get at the store.  Additionally, there were barely a handful of fries with the meal.  The chicken was very overdone and dry.  There was also a very heavy "woodfire" taste that almost seemed artifical.  My wife's meal was also disappointing.  There were only 3 ribs.  They were moderately sized and slightly overdone as well.  The chicken breast was unimpressive as well as it appeared to be a cutlet rather than a chicken breast.  Her chicken was also very dry and had a very heavy "woodfire" taste that seemed artifical as well.  She ordered a baked potato as her side and that was the best part of her meal.    Service was somewhat unattentive as we had to wait for drink refills which did not help with our disappointment with the entire meal.  Luckily we had a gift card otherwise I would have been even more upset with having to pay for the entire meal.  All in all, not very impressed and will probably be a long time, if ever, that we go back.  There are better choices for steakhouses in town with better food for comparable prices.
2	o6npVKhlzjaRehInIoBjw	Star Rating: 2.5 because it is between "Meh. I've experienced better" and "A-Ok"  Long Winded Experience: I have been patronizing this establishment since I was in High School over ten years ago. Our favorite pizza of choice is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It's extremely delicious, but over the last ten years we have experienced lack-luster presentation and portions from Beach Pizza with this pizza specifically. They treat the chicken pieces like precious metals, sprinkling just a few bits here and there to add "sparkle" to what can only be called a Ranch/Cheese pizza, not a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. We've even asked, every time since the 2nd or 3rd time ordering it, for *extra* chicken. They go ahead and charge us $5 for extra chicken, but the pizza looks just like if you order it without extra chicken. It's completely disappointing and frustrating. The pizza is very delicious and a unique specialty pie, but is it worth $25 for an 18" pizza that only has a smattering of Buffalo Chicken on it? I think not. Sorry, Beach Pizza. You have a wonderful concept, and a talented team to pull it off, but you skimp on toppings that make the pizza. My friends and I have eaten our last of Beach Pizza.   TL;DR: Delicious Specialty Pizza, but lacks sufficient "Bang-for-your-buck" in the toppings department for the price and "Extra toppings" vanish into thin air as you pay for them.
4	TVMqQ2woieTXsOpzoEH8hQ	This is a to-go wing place with a DRIVE THRU.  Yeah, man, you can just, like, drive through and get a dozen wings.  The added bonus to this not-having-to-get-out-of-your-car trend is that the wings are actually not bad.  They're not restaurant style phenomenal, but they're descent for the price.  I prefer the honey hot since the extra hot are more like mild to me, so I go for flavor.  They're tiny little wings, like half the size of an Oregano's wing, but the sauce is essentially tasty and again, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.   I've never eaten there, and I probably never will. The place is uncomfortable and muggy, always turned to the Spanish channel or Fox news on the little TV's.  What I noticed about this place is that calling in an order ahead of time doesn't matter, they still don't cook it until you get there.  Which is fine, but sort of odd.  In fact, I feel as though I've waited LONGER when I call in an order rather than just gone to the drive through.   The fries are not bad, but you have to salt them yourself because I don't think they salt them.  Also fine, but sort of odd.  The service is usually prompt and helpful though the employee appears to be a 13 year old boy.  Fine, yet odd.   This is not a bad place for some cheap, tasty to-go wings and also, man, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.  In honor of this, sometimes my comrad and I just sit in the car and eat our wings to see how disgusting and white trashy we can get.
4	SAEOa1EzpdNQ78igpOrWA	The employees here are very nice and are on top of things.  The grounds are well kept and it is very peaceful here.  Our waitress at the caf\u00e9 was very nice and personable.  Food was good.  The spa is tranquil and has a nice steam room. The rooms are nice.... dated (not modern)....but still nice.
2	qKLUOKOYKVyCeWimj2ja2Q	I ordered 5 wing combo for lunch one afternoon and they took longer than expected. The staffseemed nice but I'm not going here again.  I ordered through the phone and they quoted ten minutes but it took more like 20 minutes. I got my drink and I was scared to choose my drink from the soda machine, the nozzles looked all dirty. I then waited for my food and checked the place out,  they have a tiny kitchen and by the looks of things the food can get contaminated very easily.  They have a great fume vent thats one thing that i was imoressed with. When I opened the bag the wings were all overcooked and dried out.  The French fries were perfect,  crispy and fluffy inside.  I would never eat here again and this is not a spot I would recommend.
4	ohxy8biRAUTl5GGudoqZQ	Outstanding pasta!!  I actually dined at their new location on 90th and Via Linda (old Amarone's).  I was there with the wife, kids, and in-laws and every single one of our dishes was out of this world.  I had the osso buco special, which was rich and delicious.  My wife had the tortellini which was great.  Other peoples' orders included fettuccine, gnocchi, and penne (all great).  We also ordered their ravioli as an appetizer and it was some of the best ravs I've ever tried!  There are not too many restaurants where everyone at the table loved their food, but it was the case this time.  Not being from Arizona I am disappointed that  I will only be able to dine here the once or twice a year that I visit.  This has now become a go to place when visiting the Phoenix area.
4	GtStGIL14zP511Bf2kg	great place! the food is always good and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. They have great, refreshing iced tea. It's just your basic tea, but it's always good.  Pretty much any dish you order will be good. A lot of their dishes are loaded with bits of garlic.  They have great lunch specials and their prices are very reasonable.
4	djaquTURn94o8AW252qA	My favorite place in Charlotte for Strawberry Pancakes!! The fruit is fresh sliced...not sitting in a pre-packaged "syrup" base. The whip cream is made fresh in house and the Kona French Press coffee is a delight!  If you are going with the regular's for a mid morning b'fast on a Saturday..plan to wait....a while.
4	iNslP8STU2xWUBGVAfBfvQ	Grab yourself a white hot, or whatever other flame broiled tube steak that does it for you, and have a seat.  Wait, get some fries or rings with that.  Like a dinner and a show?  While you're waiting in line, you get to watch the grill masters at their culinary best.  I thought Buffalo NY was known for chicken wings and grain elevators, but apparently they know a thing or two about serving up and incredible meat-by-product encased in sheepskin (actually, I think its the small intestine of sheep).  So far, I haven't gotten any dogs which are ribbed (for my or anyone else's pleasure).  Come out and get a taste of Buffalo, because if you like hot dogs, then you'll love what Ted's has to offer.  -Swoop
4	SrUXh1ATfSZqGLbhiw3g	Not going to make this long. It's breakfast. But it's a little fun. I sat at the counter for the first time and it was cool. Fun to watch them cook and wash dishes felt like an old time diner from the 50's.   I've read some reviews people crying around about long cook times and having to wait for this or that. It's pretty much a given when coming here for breakfast But its worth it. So for those who don't like to wait for something good, please don't come back and that way the rest up us will get sat faster. ;)  If you haven't ever been to a Waffle House you should try it. The waffles are mandatory and it doesn't hurt to try a side of scrambled cheesy eggs. Jen had a omelet and I think not weighed about five pounds. With tip we still walked out for less than $20. Shout out to Keshaun who served us he was very pleasant and made the visit that much better.
2	a5rgQiz8v0bi75zLiWwN6A	I've eaten at this Macayo's three times, and each time I leave unimpressed.  The service is ok, the food is ok.  That's about it.    The plates I've ordered were drowning in cheese - now I love cheese, but I almost need a spoon to eat these meals.    I know some people have raved about Macayo's, but I'm not thrilled with it.
2	ttbnWSTO9EYII8KkrExEkg	I usually don't like giving 3 stars or less..  But I honestly don't think this place deserves more than 2 stars!  Went there over the weekend with group of friends (5 people).  Okay.. I will just cut to the chase.  50 mins to get dinner.  Asked multiple times for refill.   Another 20 mins to pay.   $20 for 12 oz ribeye with 2 sides, and it wasn't that great!  I can get better service and better tasting steak for less at Texas road house.  This explains why lot of their locations are out of business..  Maybe they should change their name to "Black Anus".. LOL! Okay that was little rude!
4	oQ1bdwe616elrsI2Ja43Dw	This review is for pies only don't waist your money eating in the restaurant. With that said I have had every pie they sell and have no negative comments. It quick and easy and the staff has always been friendly.
4	ajvwBOTxxRPJ7G1O4Z7Yw	I tried them again, and they've redeemed themselves.  I went back and the food was much better so I change my original opinion of 1 star.  The previous visit that was so horrible was a drive through visit. This last time I actually ate inside so maybe that's key.
4	uqNUBdDAhE9PQ0QmEwy4kA	I think Daren C. and I have the same taste buds! Now that I have mine back that is.... long story.   I went to have my dogs groomed in the area and the owner of the kennel said this joint has a great breakfast.  So I love to eat and I had an hour to kill so 40th street here I come. He was right this joint has a pretty tasty Bfast. I had this skillet with Eggs, Chorizo, onions, peppers and potatoes. It was huge! It was nummy nu mmy in my tummy. The best part is.......wait for it.........they had my favorite coffee ever! Farmer Brothers! I am not a coffee drinker and don't claim to be but I will drink a pot of that Farmer Brothers it is so good! Warning do not order the sausage gravy, it is not real gravy and they just toss sausage in it YUCK! Besides the gravy and one annoying waitress. This joint is cool with me. I took one star away because they need to clean a little better. All and all good food, good price, good portions and a good start to my day! Thanks
4	qYNlFZxs31OLmP7CARFRzg	I agree..very good margaritas!  The flautas are really good also.  But absolutely NO atmosphere.  Great place to grab a quick bite (and margy) when you don't have much time or care about a quiet surrounding.
4	JQ9tCNB3PFge3lWjl1OQ	I enjoy a great little corner diner! It seemed like a place "that everybody knows your name, " which I really enjoyed.  I was greeted immediately and my waitress could not have been any friendlier!  The place was some what full for a mid week late morning, but my coffee cup remained full.  Go for the breakfast. The omelets are heaping full. I ordered the "everything" omelet and it was packed. Exactly what I am looking for when I order something like this.   This was my first visit, but in all honesty, I see myself coming back many times. This place was a great breakfast/lunch find!
4	lJov6BteBaMlp6kGRoe0Q	We just recently moved from San Francisco, and we are happy to find this Vietnamese kitchen here in Mesa. The taste of pho (beef noodle soup) is authentic and delicious. We also ordered the BBQ pork w/ vermicelli noodles with chili sauce on the side. The restaurant is a cafe-style atmosphere, clean, and very pleasant to eat in. The Price is about $7-8 per item; it is a bit more expensive than in San Francisco due to less competition. We also love their home made dessert for $3.50 and will definitely revisit soon.
4	1bnJhTIy1DAPQXsVJ353aw	Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have.
2	C0uUs0kYTZOo6p2jqyxGng	This was  my first time here, and since it was downtown and lunch time, I decided to call to see if they validate for any  of the nearby parking garages if you eat there. Called up, a man answered, told him exactly what I said above, and was told  " yeah, there sure is, the Chase garage." So I park there, and upon asking for validation I am told they do not do that. I let the woman know that I called and was told otherwise. She then rudely tells me she is the owner and only her and one other person answer the phones. I tell her I talked to a man, she then hollers to the back asking someone if they validate, and the man says nope. She  then tells me I must have misunderstood.   I did not misunderstand, the person who answered the phone must not have been listening to my question....so on top of my overpriced and mediocre sandwich, I had to pay to park. People here were rude, and I felt like I was being rushed the whole time even when it was not busy.  The only positive thing I can say is that the place was very clean, if you do try this place I hope it's better than my experience.
2	16TFBXx5uDgi4qiTzdFQ	Roy's is suppose to be good. And being my first experience here, it was just TERRIBLE. It was a fusion of untasteful flavors that was just disappointing.   Starting with the drinks, the fruit drinks tasted very off in flavor...chemical flavors, man! Our entire party thought the food was mediocre and quite below par. I ordered the Szechuan Peppercorn Salmon dish with garlic rice and bak choy. My expectations was a very spicy and tasty dish. But instead, the berry toppings were overcooked and the salmon tasted like something I could make at home.   The appetizer platter we tried had a sweet and sour sauce, but it tasted more sour than anything. Eww! Maybe that evening's head chef didn't feel like cooking, but man the food was just bad.   Would this deter me from another visit to Roy's? No. But if I experience it again, Roy's will be off my list.
2	3M4oo6k9XiWH1MK4bIKZYg	We were very disappointed.  We had a 20 min. Wait to be seated on a Sunday morning which was ok but after we ordered breakfast we had to wait 50 min. For our food.  Presentation of food was very bad n food was cold.  Toast was like warm bread even after we asked for dark toast hoping we would get a real piece of toast. Inside needs to be updated.
2	eN4Zk9wuBLbXx2EOpYyoQ	Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.
2	dDRHlUA6PPYASibILxfnJg	I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.  The last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said "SEE ID." So, she asked me, "Do you want me to look at your ID?" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.  The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.
2	sB0fts8to5pL90U8K07pmg	I'm a huge fan of diners, but gotta be honest I wasn't too crazy about this one. Our server was awesome, super friendly and helpful in answering questions, but the food I ordered wasn't too great.  I ordered biscuits and gravy (the full order, which I have to add is ALOT and barely ate half of it) and some country potatoes on the side.  I felt like there was just a lot of flour going on in my food- kinda bland no flavor. The country potatoes were the best part and my pepsi.  The overall consensus at the table was it was decent not bad, just wouldn't go out of my way to grab a bite there in the future.  Maybe I should have went with chorizo?
2	k3lAkBIZVomshbr9PYZtXg	We often eat at the Legacy Golf Course restaurant and decided to give this place a try. First off this place is seriously dated, as in mid 90's model home dated, right down to the faux finish walls. The view was not very good, and the little view that they did have was covered by blinds. Unfortunately the view was better than the food. I had the chicken piccata which was rubbery, bitter, and seemed to not have any lemon in it whatsoever. My husband had the tuna melt which was bland. While he was able to eat his I couldn't get past two bites of mine and sent it back.  I do have to give credit for the service though. She was friendly and very efficient considering she was doing double duty as bartender and server.
4	CN4aMMhBmwOM0zTlYDbHkg	I would say the Phoenix Hard Rock is pretty average as Hard Rock's go. We had a nice time and enjoyed a couple of their specialty drinks while we were there.   If there is a sporting event downtown the Hard Rock is probably busier. However, most other times the downtown is a ghost town after 6. We had the place to ourself, but their wasn't much else to do in the area.
2	ONh8Cwv2dL1uXV3FV8SkLQ	The past few times I have stopped at this restaurant to use the drive thru; its been backed up to at least 9 cars.  This McDonalds had customers all confused of who was next in line, which unfortunately there was customers trying to cut in from another side of the drive thru. BUT still if McDonalds was having a order that was taking longer then usual, then ask the customers nicely to park to the side so you can move the other cars waiting.  I thought maybe the whole Restaurant was behind but someone parked and went inside to get their food, to come out only 2 minutes later.  Unfortunately I could not do that since I was caught in the middle of the line.  That indicated to me that they were not behind through the whole store, it was just the drive thru that was sucking.  I like this McDonalds, but they need to be aware of their customers outside also. Its unpleasant when you have to deal with other customers trying to act like they been in line the whole time and trying to cut in from a different side of the McDonalds.  Very rude.  Its common knowledge that the mornings and lunch hours are the busiest, put in better procedures or processes to make sure the customer is happy.
4	BjPVE8qVIvyCwAAgnBjpkQ	I went here with a couple friends, and we had two appetizers plus our entrees.  The nacho appetizer was great; the beef strips appetizer was not quite up to par for the price.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich--the chicken was grilled just right without being too dry, and the buffalo sauce was perfect (hot, but not overwhelmingly so).  They had a good draft beer selection.  Overall, a good time, I'd certainly go back.
2	ehk3YDLy7yuWIxpupcBFw	I don't really know why I have been to this place more than once. But because I have, I feel confident in my low score.  First of all, no matter when you come in - lunch hour or in the middle of the afternoon when there's no one in there at all - you have to wait forever!  How long does it seriously take to put cream cheese on a bagel?  Secondly, i don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. The sandwhich combinations aren't the best. And their everything bagels have an overpowering rye taste --- this might be a preference issue. But alas.   I am not going back. I mean it this time. For serious.
2	RIvOTrYuFuJyUULX4VaLkw	Okay, let's be real and fair. The place is about as good as a truck stop. No offense to truckers. The dining room needs a major overhaul. The food can be best described as deep fried this and canned that. There are a few saving graces. The chicken, fried and baked, is actually moist and tasty. The steak is fairly good. The desserts are good. The service? Well, I've never actually had someone come to my table but the cashiers each time have been very friendly and welcoming.  Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy dining here.
4	3kqngRBE08yhb6MaitEnAQ	Yorkmont Cafe is a pretty good find if you are in a hurry and need something quick but don't want a fast food option.   The setup is similar to Showmar's where you order the food at the counter and they will either bring it out to you or pack it up to go.   The staff was very friendly. I told them it was my first time and they offered some great selections. They have anything you can imagine here...burgers, fish, shrimp, chicken pitas, salad, hot dogs and even breakfast!!!!   There is no reason you couldn't find something to enjoy.   For lunch, I settled on a veggie burger and fries. All combos come with your choice of one side and a drink. The combo was under $8, and was prepared HOT right then, I don't mind waiting when I know they are cooking it fresh! The burger was prepared on a sesame seed bun, it was hot all toppings were as requested and my french fries were nice and crispy. Simply delicious!   Overall, I really enjoyed the meal! I definitely will be returning here to try more of their menu options!
4	Wc65JBB25pZNGpfjrxA	I am a pizza snob...I had stuft pizza while growing up and the original Round Table Pizza as well - you have to love the Bay Area.  I never found pizza that was comparable to Stuft Pizza in all the places that I lived - okay, aside from Vegas -- there was North Side Nathan's.  The crust here at Barro's is very close to Stuft Pizza and that is why hubby and I love it so much. It doesn't taste over processed and from a mix. It tastes like it's made there every day - a bonus!  Their wings are pretty tasty and a bit bigger than we expected, which is a good thing.  :)  We prefer having them deliver or going to pick up the pizza ourselves. It's clear that it's a very loud place...and I don't do loud places too well. ;) Well, that and I dislike little children running around me trying to beg for food off me.  Definitely a thumbs up from hubby and myself!  Now if they only had pesto pizza on the menu...
4	mhCxF81HZjPWxUGUqkZ4Q	I love local run shops! I love when the owners are friendly with their cliental. This was my 1st time to Yoko, but I have to say I'm sure it won't be my last!     I ordered the orange chicken bowl, and now if you're thinking panda express chicken man you are off base. This is fresh orange chicken, with slices of fresh orange rinds in the sauce. It was a clean orange taste, very delish!  Was impressed.
2	ZVf29uEY1ct2MVkm23XAyw	Service was a bit slow, although I was seated quickly. Corn chowder was tasty but not very hot. Had the Cheddar  Broccoli Quiche. Filling was good, but the crust was really soggy, even the edges. Seemed like it could have been microwaved. Probably won't go back unless that is where others want to go.
2	bNz0TPkH8r237yIUfzv5AQ	I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste.
4	FBxSJuaMJsodvwStd9o0g	Best place to come and watch college football while eating some spicy buffalo wings or any of the other buffalo wing sauce combos . They have a great variety of wings which are all really good and they have some good beer on top plus they show pretty much every college or professional sporting game taking place around the nation on their dozens of plasma TVs. They even have plasmas  over the urinals in the bathroom so u won't miss out on any of the action.
4	KNvcYcnVQ9nrvdgkLVMw	We don't live in the area, but girlfriend and I saw a Groupon offer, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  We pull up to see only 3 cars in the lot on a Saturday night at 730p and thought it would be awful. We could not have been more wrong. Great service and fantastic burgers. Beer was cheap and cold.
4	BL3DiQcCXximy2ezAJYmsg	I really enjoy PCG, mostly because it IS a neighborhood restaurant.  It's predictable and simple.  It's reasonably priced and far better than standard.    Things I adore are: Griddled corn cakes with black beans and grilled chicken, so good and less than $10. The carnitas taco app is wonderful and SO much food.  It's too much for me to eat at dinner and it's about eight bucks! The pot roast sounds simple, and it is, but dang, it's so yummy.  Super tender meat and homemade mashed potatoes with just the right about of gravy and topped with fried parsnips.  You can't go wrong.  I'm very disappointed that two things I loved on the menu are gone.  First, is the ahi salad, it was really good.  When I inquired, I was told that with the rising costs of ahi that it wasn't a cost effective option.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the blackened chicken sandwich.  I craved it.  Blackened chicken with applewood smoked bacon, jack cheese on a grilled bun.  They changed.  Dammit!  Why?  I'm holding a little grudge on that one.  At lunch, I always get the soup and salad.  Soups are good, particularly the yellow split pea and I love the honey ginger salad dressing.  The bar is good for happy hour and relaxing after a movie or a night out.
4	klj2eXv1N8bOXeluaM6Dg	Mtchells is one of the best fish places around.  I really like their Shanghi preparation of my fish. It's just delicious.  The establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.    Oddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It's always so warm and tasty.  The deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really liked  They also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch.
4	AQgEmPqxUVttMCPQnc7zsg	Saturday is always a busy night to go out, so we knew there would be a wait, and 20 minutes isn't bad. So after about 20 minutes I witnessed a couple get seated that came in after us....huh?! Then another, and another....what?! So my husband went up to talk to them (I think to shut me up) and oh the little hand held buzzer thing they gave us wasn't working. I was so angry (and hungry) I could have screamed. Although the evening started out crummy, the manager was really great and brought us out an appetizer platter on the house.  The food was good and the bread sticks hit the spot.
2	PpRYgGEJ0i2Dx71QSjI2w	After a much glorified recommendation from the waiter too get the pork c hop special, result was 4 dried out chops, 4 undercooked risottos ( which they replaced with something else, ours were the last they had for the night). After mention of the chops drones, we're told they would melt in mouth, that was not going to happen with those chopsn we were offered free dessert. Took it home, tiramisu, will taste in the AM for breakfast. Disappointing as previous visit was actually quite good. Fifth person had the meatballs, said they were good.  Appetizers muscles were good as was the soup.
2	DkDRDq2t86ytmC9jBdZg	I've been to this location 4 times and they got my order wrong 3 times AND made me late returning from lunch. I don't expect much, I mean it's not Le Cordon Bleu but it's not rocket science either. I go out of my way to avoid fast food but had time constraints on my visits so had no alternative.   The last guy at the window was in a spectacular mood. So much so that I was prompted to ask him if he was medicated and if so, to give me his doctor's phone number. He laughed and said he loves his job. Wrap your mind around that. He amused me for the rest of my time in the Gulag that pays my bills. He got my order right for a change so I was pleased.
2	dC5iqVYtZe4YZYFfG3VWiQ	I'd have to disgree with the previous reviews.  I ate lunch at The Old Fashioned Last week and I was frankly not impressed.  Basically this restaurant is just an upscale Culver's.  You order your food at the bar and they give you what appears to be a cow ear tag with a number on it.  It took over a half hour for my friend and I to get our lunches, and we actually had to ask a staff member what the hold up.  It was crowded, but how long can a burger and a bowl of soup take?  My friend ordered her cheeseburger medium and it came well done, and my soup and salad cost $12!!!  The pumpkin soup was good, but not stellar and the salad definitely wasn't worth 8 bucks.  The only nice thing is that you don't have to worry about a tip, so that helps to justify the prices.  All-in-all, I love the concept and will probably give it another shot for dinner, but I can't justify $12 for a mediocre lunch. 2 1/2 Stars.
4	I1Kig9qLLIQo8JyVfiJA6w	We walked in to a big hello. Two guys helped with the doors as we had 3 large suitcases. Friendly and great personality of waitresses everyone in a good mood. I had the grilled chicken biscuit.YUM jack had the omelet and the best hashbrowns yet. Great place. Cheap. Good coffee too.
4	wPA7OsNYVEvZ45tnGuamjg	The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.  It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it.  I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!
2	Uj4RszONlv3bVfkTAJIg	Sorry guys, I just wasn't impressed with Long Wongs.  Dude and I were feeling like wings one evening after bowling, so we decided to stop in here and get some to go and see what the big whoop was.   We tried the Hot and Suicide flavors.   The wing sauces were way too salty, vinegary, and the wings were pretty bare meat wise.    Meh, I've experienced better indeed sums it up.
2	jwRsSOUigAJDr22iqTBA	I mean its a McDonald's, so expect McDonald's type of food.    The only reason I am reviewing this sub-par McDonald's is to note that their breakfast burritos suck.    I don't mean to make this personal, but whoever they've got back there may be an expert at flipping burgers, but doesn't have a clue about rolling burritos.   On a positive side, they support the local area by having different community events such as McTeacher night in which teachers from a local school volunteer for a few hours with proceeds going back to schools.    If you have to go here for breakfast, stay away from the breakfast burritos!!

I remember seeing them in the airport, then in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and recently after looking for some good Mexican food near Scottsdale Shea Healthcare to take my girl to lunch I noticed a Yelp Deal for this place and thought it was finally worth a shot.   It was not until I walked up to the front door and noticed the Local First AZ Sticker that I knew it was locally owned. Sorry for taking all your time to mention that, it's important to me.   So to the restaurant, it's your typical fast casual restaurant, you order, pick up your food with a number, get your own drinks, salsa, but a waitress comes around to refill your drinks or clear away empty plates.   The food was pretty delicious. HUGE portions. For sure something that can be shared, or eat half of it and take it back to work for lunch the next day.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the menu looked exciting enough to where I had trouble picking something and I look forward to going back and trying something new, like the enchiladas.   The salsa bar and chips deserves its own paragraph. If you like Baja Fresh's salsa bar, then you'll also like Blue Burrito's. I believe there was 4 different salsa options, plus cilantro. Then there is a big container of fresh chips. They were still warm and very tasty. It's all you can eat for the salsa and chips which is awesome!!  Next time we go back, I want to get a margarita too!
4	ue6GIRvn36mRPFvyJDSJA	I have driven by this place on Central Avenue for years and never stopped in.  Decided today to grab a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised...the cheeseteak was quite good, but disappointed they don't make them with whiz, the fries were decent and I love that they sell Tastycakes...yummy!  The staff was very friendly and the few tables fill up quickly, so beware of what time you come if you want to eat there.
2	1AN1rMmYveZd5w3VHNXlkw	This Red Lobster used to be very good. It has gone way downhill over the past 5-7yrs. Back in 2005-2006 the food was very good. I usually would get the Seafood platter, Flounder, Shrimp Linguini Alfredo or  Seaside Shrimp Trio. My wife always got the Crab Liguini Alfredo or Salmon. The last time we went was over a year ago. We thought we would give it another chance. Getting a table is never a problem, as this place is never really packed except on Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. Back in 2005 we would have to wait. We always get the cheesy biscuits and water/beer or soda right away. The cheesy biscuits is still the best thing on their menu.The water tastes like filters sink water, which is horrible. I couldn't even drink it. We got the Lobster Pizza and Lobster-Artichoke-and-Seafood Dip for appetizers.  Pizza was a little dry, but not too bad. The artichoke dip was still good. We got our salad after the appetizer. Why are their salads so watery? It's like they rinse off the lettuce and just drop it into the bowl. Then add the chicken and Caesar dressing. Half the lettuce was soggy or was too wet. Blah!! My wife ordered the Crab Linguini and I got the Seaside Shrimp Trio. The portion size of these meals have shrunk considerably. It seemed like I was missing at least 1/3 of my shrimp that I usually get. Some of the shrimp was tough to chew and not succulent like it should be. My wife did not like the Crab Linguini. Said it tasted funny. The crab may have been frozen or something, but she had eaten it many, many times in the past and it wasn't as good this time. It was bad enough we had to wait well over 30 mins to get our food. Then we had to wait awhile to get our drinks refilled. It just wasn't a good experience. The last 2 times we had been there wasn't much better. We decided to not go to Red Lobster anymore. At least not to any in Arizona. Stay away from this Red Lobster. The food quality has dropped over the past 6 years.
4	24yvIf22ISyxhtJ7gw2Wjw	We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.  Went with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.  Husband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)  Great place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time.
4	pM31zlz8D2kHBNTFPFeZg	I was shopping at the mall, and I got hungry So I thought about my choices, and decided to try out PF Chang's.  I haven't eaten PF Chang's in like... 10 years.  I ordered their lettuce wraps, and man o man, I loved them! I could eat them every day.  So yeah, that's all.  I did like that when I told the server of my peanut allergy, she totally took it seriously and had the kitchen use separate pots and pans for my food.  I'm such a princess.  :)
4	l0mgfbeoE34F40r4X2Z5w	Jumpin Java and Bistro 160 are part of each other. The breakfast there is your average breakfast. Eggs, bacon or sausage etc. They really have good french toast and waffles.  I can't speak for the coffee since they carry one of my favorite sodas (Dr. Bowns Black Cherry.. try it, youl like it) and I tend to order that over coffee.   They also have sandwiches for lunch and a case full of chocolates that rotate seasonally. Its a charming little spot with friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere.
4	hb9Kg4VSGpeQuHwHqyh2Q	Although I'd been in this shopping center before, last night was my first time dining at Arrivederci... some friends of mine were in from out of town and suggested we meet here for dinner.  I bit my tongue instead of suggesting Giuseppe's instead and figured, why not try somewhere new?  I'm happy I did.  I was extremely impressed with Arrivederci.  Service was fantastic, portions were really big, and the company was a cherry on top.  There were 5 of us total, and I think everybody was happy with our experience.  We received fresh warm rolls and a pesto-olive oil sauce off the bat... yum!  Our waters and drinks were refilled constantly which is always a big plus.  Side note - everytime I said 'thank you,' our Italian waiter replied with a 'prego' - so charming; it made me feel like I was really in Italy!  I started with the arugula salad... it was lightly dressed with a perfect balsamic, and had just the right amount of tomato, parmesan cheese and artichoke.  (I think the artichokes came from a can, but I like canned artichokes, so it was fine with me).  The others seemed to enjoy their caesar salads just as much.  For my main entree, I had the linguine vongole cozze e calamari (Linguine with clams, mussels, calamari and zucchini) in red sauce.  It was delicious!  Other dishes at our table were the spaghetti and meatballs, and a pasta dish that had Italian Sausage, chicken breast, bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, sauted in white wine with a touch of tomato sauce - that was a hit as well!  We were all too full to order dessert this time, so I'll have to remember to save room my next visit.  I really don't think you can go wrong dining at Arrivederci... it's casual, charming, local, and they've proven successful since they've been open since 1995.  Cheers to many more years of success... Gratzi Arrivederci!
4	kvlcJhQp6sFpebkQyddhbg	This place gets the four stars because of the patio.  What a GORGEOUS patio to sit at in November.  Food is pretty good... average I guess, but I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I had the Bacado omelette (bacon and avocado) and it wasn't bad, but nothing special.  Now... the potatoes that come with it... I LOVED those.  Love the seasoning.  Service was not bad... server kinda ditzy paired with my friend's dry humor... recipe for humiliation, but otherwise good.
4	4VgJYQtWwAMnLfamFvoig	Ok...if the market sandwich of the day is the BLT, order it. It will make you weak. Otherwise, I am faithful to the Mozzerella, Tomato, Basil...either as a sandwich in their chewy lovely bread or prepared as a salad (with a bit of his signature crusty loaf on the side.) I've also never gone wrong ordering their fresh fruit, the watermelon with a squeeze of fresh lemon is wonderfully refreshing when it's in season. Add a little somethin' somethin' from LUX next door and you'll be rubbing your belly and getting your three wishes fulfilled all at the same time.
4	pWrIw6M6bRuq8CxbS9A	Since I love sushi and have been eating all varieties of Asian food since high school, I tend to avoid ordering teriyaki dishes when I go to Japanese restaurants. Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet, but there is always so much - sushi, edamame, seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with. Going forward, Blue Fin will be an exception to this no-teriyaki rule of mine. In fact, I may even go there *because* of the teriyaki.   My husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the teriyaki combos (served with salad and rice) - he got beef and I got the white-meat chicken. Both were priced around $6. The food took a while to come out, and there were no seats left inside, so we had to sit outside, but the owner/manager was super nice, offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready.   When she brought our plates, we were shocked at how huge the portions were. Yes, there was tons of salad (with a delicious sesame dressing) and white rice, but there was also a *lot* of meat. My husband and I believe ourselves to have larger-than-average appetites, but we could barely finish one plate and vowed to split one next time. So, the portions were huge, but the teriyaki flavor was also amazing. It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet, serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze. The black sesame seeds and spicy powder they put on the table were nice add-ons but weren't even necessary since the sauce was so flavorful. I am, however, docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew.   After years of avoiding teriyaki, The Blue Fin makes me actually crave it. Plus, it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff. I will definitely be back.
2	ABLxlWKtrPyrstLJICYL6g	MFV has a change of owners and name. Was purchased by Zen's Cafe and now operates under that name.  Was a regular at MFV.  Have only been there once since Zen's took it over.  I want to be fair, but it's just not the same. The fish fry is a different recipe and not as good as it used to be.
4	KhbMBHQaEi12NsacutpkLQ	A great Asian buffet. They have a sushi chef in the middle ready to make any kind of sushi roll on the spot. They even offer brown rice options too. (Although my brown rice california rolls were a little harder than I would like)  They have your typical Chinese food options like Orange chicken, crab puffs, string beans, lo-mein etc... There's a hibachi corner as well where you can make your own plates of stir-fry.   The dessert here is much better than Pacific buffet in Chandler. They have a chocolate mousse cake that was really yummy. I don't think they're homemade but still didn't taste old like other buffet places I've been to.   There's a bar as well but I didn't order any alcoholic beverages.   My husband loved the crab legs which are always a customer favorite so you have to keep an eye out for them.  I would say they refresh the buffet items fairly quickly. I checked in on Yelp and even got a $5off discount!  Average dinner price is $16-$17.
2	iojtwQYTuVlOMueOlY9DsA	This place has went downhill bad. I remember going here for prom or when people would visit from out of town. Now im not so sure. The service sucks. The food is pretty mediocre. I was there on a Friday night and ordered the prime rib only to be informed that they were out. So I ordered a ribye and it was ok. The steak was cooked right but just didn't have much flavor. After dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks. When I got out there I grabbed a chair so she could see over the deck and the bartender rudely told me that I can't use the chair. It is only for people sitting at the bar. I hope this place fixes some of these problems because I want to like it again
2	rQ0pSsnaRi825UCTCLw	Ordered multiple times from this Pizza Hut location, and were consistently unimpressed. The service was decent and the delivery guys were friendly enough, but they never got the pizza to us either fast or hot (which, in effect, may well have been one in the same had they been on the ball). The pizzas we received with each order had obviously either sat in the restaurant for longer than they should prior to dispatch, or had been in whatever Pizza Hut calls their keep-warm sleeves they transport the pies in. The service times were also notably slower than other delivery joints in the area--I'm not going to compare Pizza Hut to Jimmy John's or somewhere that prides itself on super-speedy service of things that don't require baking, but Domino's was far superior in both timeframe and quality of delivered goods, for instance--and overall, I was far less impressed with this Pizza Hut than I was with... well, everyone else. When we moved into their service area, we first noticed that the service was slower than it had been on the other side of town from a different location. Having called in orders to both, I realize that they had longer hold times as well, which could account for longer delivery times, but if all the pizzas are getting baked and ready but not getting delivered while the cheese is still hot and stringy on a consistent basis, you either need to wait another couple of minutes before throwing the next batch of pizzas through the oven, or hire more drivers. If you're doing the amount of business that requires a five-minute hold time on the telephone, you can afford another driver for rush situations, right? Overall, we stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut and started ordering from Domino's. Quality was better, speed of service was better. Which means that they're doing the job of pizza delivery better, end of story.
2	5rugzxbvZGVXRQ9RQW6fw	Slower every time I come.  Today order was done wrong.  It is not busy so why must we wait for service (to order and to pay) and then receive order half right. We hit another location in the area and always get better service so we decided that's just where we'll take our business.
2	wmh6F0z4GTuvZ3TD476BQ	Stopped in for takeout on the #1 Goi Cuon (fresh spring rolls), and #19, Pho with fish cake balls, shrimp, imitation crab in beef broth. Well, I was pretty disappointed to see no brown peanut sauce for the goi cuon, but a vinegary concoction in the plastic cup, why?!   My pho is a usual order, but tonight the noodles seemed to get mushy really fast, and the broth didn't seem to have the strong beefy flavor I like. My trips to Pho Kim 88 have been drastically reduced, and after tonight, it's going to be longer stretch of time before I go back. Tonight was a big strike out.
2	wZ3Hwk0eeOnTSBu4PBnBbg	My sandwich was pretty decently priced. Good quality meat. It wasnt busy, so I got in and out very fast.  My only 2 complaints: My lettuce was white and brown. Not appetizing at all.  That, and I asked for them to go "easy on the mayo", which apparently meant to slop it on so that it literally drips, huge drops of mayo, out of the bottom while being eaten.  Meh. There are much better sandwich places in the same area.
2	D0qvQHV3CKGc8eXv2Zf7w	-Server gave me a dirty napkin  -Server rushed us to order  -Server gave me a dirty dish  -Server rolled his eyes in front of me and my girl friend when we asked for separate lunch checks (well before he printed the bill).  The food was decent. I've had better at other locations.Service was NOT up to par.
4	SoSGh1XDVe4FvSVfG6Cow	How had I never heard of this place?  Oh yea - there aren't any in Phx!   While running errands at work I found this little goodie. I got one of their specialty sandwiches as a combo with a drink and a side salad for - after tax $7.10.  The sandwich was good, served on still warm foccacia bread with chunks of turkey.  But the side salad was freaking amazing.  Not that it came with golden sprinkles or anything - but it was a styrofoam cup filled - truly packed - with a great selection of green leaf/mixed greens.  On top of that were a few slices of tomato and cucumber and a pinch of sprouts.  Had I dumped these things out and "fluffed" the greens it easily would have filled a medium to large sized bowl. And want to know how much that costs all by itself?  .98 cents.  WOW!  I was shocked.  That is the same price as all of their sides including a bag of chips, a scoop of ice cream and 2 cookies.    I grabbed one of their homemade looking oatmeal raisin cookies for my at the office sweet craving that always kicks in an hour or so after lunch.  YUM!  Really sweet, but quite good.    This location also houses their fully integrated sister restaurant - Teriyaki Stix.  So from the same counter you can order a sandwich, salad or a rice bowl.  They had several different kinds and a few that I saw looked pretty great.   One last note - Ice cream sandwich is $1.50.  Sheesh!  How is a sweets craving girl supposed to fight that one?  Especially when one can so easily rationalize away about starting with that healthy sandwich? So mean!
2	CBvhjFoYyeeptGEnTA7ZzA	Got say not happy i was staying at the holiday inn here and Mesa and was in the mood  for something italian so I thought I would try it here......wrong place. The price was ok the delivery time was ok but the food completely miss the mark! I got lasagna, garlic bread, and minestrone soup.  The soup had no noodles or beans and was very spice. The garlic bread was the only thing that was kinda ok but still left much to be desired. And when it comes to the lasagna.....idk what it was but it wasn't lasagna I had two bites and through it away worst ever!  So  with all that said if your looking for good Italian look somewhere else.
2	TXCUCETQPqvpHLuOMuFpRw	Like Randy Jackson used to say "it was kinda pitchy, dawg. It was just a'ight for me." There's no such thing as bad pizza, but there's a lot of mediocre and HH falls into that category.  This is a bunch of pre-fab and frozen ingredients, hoisted onto pre-fab dough, to be baked and served up as a notch above bowling alley 'za. Luckily, it is priced accordingly.  Cheap, fast, convenient, but not at all exceptional. However, if you have one of their frequently mailed out coupons, I don't think there's a better value when you need to feed 12 kids.
4	e2HCaDlNSw4RPxJ973UnOw	I got here 1 minute after 3:00pm -- 1 minute -- and she told me that they don't serve lunch anymore.  So I threatened to leave, thinking full well she would ask me to stay and say "Okay, I'll let it slide this time..." but she didn't.  Halfway to my car I realized I was hungry, so I returned and asked if I could look at the menu anyway.  Dammit.  I got the small portion of orange chicken which ended up being about the same price anyway.  Despite the initial annoyance, I found it very tasty and scrumptious (did I just use the word scrumptious?), so I'm bumping my review up to a 4.  Just make sure to get there PLENTY OF TIME before lunch ends at 3.  Jeez.
2	GfwjjAbYwYN6gE6ZHU702w	I have been bugging a buddy to hit this place up for lunch for quite some time now. We wound up here after the wait at another spot was much too long. For less than seven bucks you can't go wrong. It is what it is. Low cost, mediocre food in enormous quantities is what you are anticipating, right?  There was literally no wait and we were seated immediately. That's about where three stars ends and two stars begins. There was no broccoli beef, but a small amount of broccoli chicken. They did offer both egg rolls and spring rolls with some of the hottest mustard I've ever had. The cheese wontons were surprisingly good, as were the BBQ pork skewers. Well, the one skewer that was left anyway. We never saw another skewer and were there close to an hour.  I wasn't expecting top shelf dining at a Chinese buffet.  However, I was expecting to eat as much as I wanted. How can you when they don't have any food out? It was as if they were getting ready to close and didn't want to put out more food. This was 12:30 in the afternoon. It's lunch time for crying out loud and we are hungry.   The service was decent, as was the food we could actually get ahold of. I have to go with two stars for the simple fact that a buffet should have food or at least make an effort to fill it up when it runs empty. Save yourself the two dollars and drink water, as the price does not include a beverage. I will probably give it another shot and update the review if it warrants a different rating.
2	KxCCNsgB5MXsdq0Ql7Q	Well it has been a little while since I have been here for lunch or dinner. I did come here for a networking meeting about 6 months ago and that was pretty good, but I didn't pay anything for it, but would have. My girlfriend and I ran in here the other day and wish I would have went to Golden Corral, but didn't have the time. There is really no selection and it hasn't really changed in 10 years or so. The manager was sitting at the table as you walked in and talking to a few people, one who used some foul language. The waitress was actually great though, I did tip her well for her service. The quality of the food was ok, but just not the selection or quality of Golden Corral and they charged us $23 for both of us for dinner with 1 soda and a water with 2 dinners. I just don't think you can compete with Golden Corral, so don't charge their prices. Keep up the good breakfast though.
2	g2Dhs0sBLQzGvGDGZZ5bVQ	All of our food had a hint of Italian seasoning, which was strange and unappealing.  The veggie enchilada is chock full of zucchini (the menu just said veggie, and I had anticipated the usual peppers and onions...if you love zucchini, get the veggie enchilada and a side of Mexican veggies - also just zucchini - unfortunately I really don't like zucchini!).  All around the place is nice, service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good.
4	iGCTa9AfKBqHAzTG12iX2Q	Awesome sports bar- and this coming from a girl who doesn't even like sports! Came here before a D-back game, and on a couple of Pub Crawls. Each time, the place was packed, yet each time, still got excellent service. Very friendly waitress and bartenders. Drinks came fast and good times were had. Decent menu, similar to other sports bars, lots of burgers and wings. Great choice when your downtown.
2	W8y4Q7gWZXVVwwqISnnA	It is a bad sign when you walk into a place and instantly have an uncontrollable desire to clean something...anything... It would behoove them to maybe wipe a few things down, or brew their tea fresh in the morning, or possibly even bake their goods before opening, instead of the day before.
2	GIp2gfkMElgmkbhCs4qMA	While we were waiting for our crepes I had a sudden craving for french onion soup. My bf noticed the boulangerie and went inside to see if they had some. He came back with a cup of soup. I opened the lid and did not see any gruyere (the melted cheese floats on top of the soup). I was like wtf! Bf went back inside to ask if the soup normally comes with the cheese and they said no. I was like damn! The cheese is like the best part of this soup! The base was alright...but come on...I need the cheese to make it complete!
2	3xe1LvZaOfeLjp9h87dTIQ	Salt, salt, salt. We used to love their lettuce wraps, best anywhere. Now we find them inedible. Their kung pao used to be good too. Everything else I thought was good has fallen off the menu too. I kept trying to give them more chances, but I am done. It IS clean and they have very nice people working there, hence the second star.
4	yjyVRyBl0lVy206EFM89Xg	Was at a business function where Avanti was the caterer.  Given that the group consisted of 160 guest, I was concerned that the quality of food would suffer.  I really should not have worried.  The menu was simple.  A simple salad, followed by a main course of a veal chop and dessert with berries and whipped cream. The veal chop was stuffed with spinach and a little cheese.  It was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I don't think I've ever had a veal chop this moist and delicious.  The berries with whipped cream were a perfect ending, as it was light and it was served with a crispy florentine with just the right amount of sweetness.  I've been to the restaurant and had mixed feelings, but for a catered event (this was at the Art Museum) I now have a renewed respect for the quality of Avanti's catering service.
4	S8LRpSszCOMSMrewtV6Q	Love this place. Their lunch buffet is great. So is their dinner menu. My partner and I went there for dinner on New Years Eve and for Valentines Day, we had so much fun. It is a relaxed atmosphere and they have great food. I recommend the Tikki Masala.
2	8MkCB2SNO41BkgmwAmNg	When I go to Las Vegas, I don't go to the Strip very often because my grandmother doesn't like to go there. The first time I went to the Firelight Buffet inside Sam's Town, it was ok. The food and service was decent enough, given the price. That visit was worth three stars.  This past experience, however, is worth two. There wasn't much of a selection and the meat was tough and dry. The service was also terrible. My grandmother asked for water three times and the waitress never brought it to her. When I returned from the bathroom, she asked me to try to get water for her and then left to get dessert. I was able to get the water for her, but it shouldn't take a customer three times to get the waitress/waiter to bring them something they need. The only reason I give them two stars instead of one is because the ice cream (that you have to ask for, not the stuff you pump from the machine yourself) is good.
2	nldCD9P8LsfB2ZVRiu8g	Popular buffet in the burbs focusing on various asian cuisines, including, Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese. The quality of the food is just OK, as you'd for these lower end buffets. This is certainly no Todai. The overall quality is influenced greatly by how long the food has been sitting under the heat lamps. The first plate of Pad Thai was pretty good, while a later plate was pretty lackluster.  While my dad loves the Korean beef that is cooked by a chef, I like the  garlic string beans best. There at least a half dozen different chicken dishes, in all different styles. I didn't care for the lemon chicken, while the others were decent.  My mom said the fish balls weren't too good. The sushi are unremarkable.  They have yellow watermelon which is good. I like the almond jello too. I'd avoid the perennial chocolate fountain.  Service is average. Sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly. Here they are about average.  $6.99 lunch includes hot tea, but not sodas. Good value. Get there early as there's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so.
4	yefTyCrQLwBH6Ij4HIew	I've enjoyed eating at El Veracruz for lunch and drinks after work.  It took me almost a year to realize that it was an old Hardee's that they slapped a patio on and turned into a Mexican restaurant.  I defiantly enjoy the outdoor patio. They are constantly making improvements to it.  It's one of the rare places in the area where you can actually sit outside.  The food is good and the portions are plentiful.  The service is always great.
4	v9VfOHyqGAUWVORinRyhIQ	Best Philly Cheese Steak in town.  A large will feed 2 people.  The honey hot wings are really good too.  Overall, this is a wonderful "cheap eats" they always have a food specials and drink specials.  They know the economy isn't doing so well and they price the food out accordingly.
2	U3OuSCkE0OdEeaeU3shfw	2 stars because let's face it, like half the bars on southside, this place is a total dive.  but a friend of mine jogged a memory of the green front, and I had to share.  back in college (duquesne) I worked around the corner at unique pizza.  and after work, i'd hurry home to change and head over to the green front where predictably I'd find my "crew" of college buddies waiting for me.  we were young and loud, and as the average age of patrons here was around 60, we totally took over the bar.  anyways, we built up a good rapport with the owners, and with the bar tenders, and I'll always remember that they knew my drink.  so that when i walked in the door, and hugged all my friends, there would be my double jim beam on the rocks with a splash of soda, waiting for me.  i miss this place.  they always had really good dinner specials.  i remember eating their club sandwiches and loving them.  they also used to do great kelbasa and sourkraut during stealers games.    good times at the green front inn.
4	IACbU5J0OvBRCQQCpu6AQQ	Nice change of pace for me, as I usually do Italian somewhere else. We had a wonderful meal...Filet, Green Beans, Mashed Potatoes, Salad, and Super Yummy Bread & Oil. Love those Carbs! Our Medium Filets were done just right. Everything was very nice. The service was good. The only complaint I had was that our mashed potatoes were not very hot. We told our server and she quickly replaced (nuked?) our spuds.
4	Ch0lWGMubidbH4kllDo2w	The first review I read of this place said it was the "only place to eat real thai food" and after stopping in, I've very tempted to agree.  My friends and I were craving Thai after leaving the Yelp holiday party the other night.  So as this was the only place for such on the way back, we stop in.  While it's not much to look at on the outside, this tiny family-run restaurant just feels welcoming once you enter.  Well lit with sizable booths (the 4 of us didn't feel cramped) and a very friendly server/host/possibly-owner.  We all proceeded to order our various dishes.  Even though the place was a bit chilly, none of us went beyond the generic "hot" level of spice.  And when my Larb came out, I'm glad I didn't.  Yow!  I might love spicy food, but I'm gonna have to train before I can get to Thai Hot levels.  Of note, the pad Thai really seems quite good.  My brother ordered it and of all the dishes at the table I tried, that impressed me the most.  It's so easy to make pad thai bland and boring, but this had a nice gentle sweetness to it.  Not that I know exactly what "real" Thai food is, but I'll be coming back here regularly to get as close to it as I can.
4	XLsi2u6JMO81UjweMzklQ	Wow! This is a great little Japanese hole-in-the-wall that seems to specialize in quality take-out.  When Brak and I walked in, the place was empty and I was ready to be disappointed, despite of the other reviews. The menu had a ton of cooked food (teriyaki, yakisoba, donburi, etc.), and as a sushi eater, I wasn't quite sure what to pick. When I asked what one item meant, the man at the counter (the owner?) said the book would help...and handed me a small photo album with photos of quite a few of the menu items. It was funny and effective.  I was surprised how busy the place is. While I was deciding what to order (3-4 minutes), the phone rang at least three times for take-out. In the half-hour I was in the dining area, at least 15 people picked up orders or sat down for a meal. It appears that they have a strong following, well-earned if the food I had was typical.  I ordered a small shrimp yakisoba and a soda. The taste was good, and even the small order was a huge amount of food. Our orders were really pretty quickly, but it didn't seem like the food was pre-made and sitting on warmers. The service was also really good; I got a kick out of the owner. He was genuinely interested in how we liked our meals.  I suggest this place for a simple, cheap dinner and would definitely visit again.

Went here on a Friday night and the hostess seemed a little lost and confused, but we managed to get a table right away (for 7pm).  I would call that early on a Friday, but still...  Our server came by and greeted us and took our orders.  Seemed like a lot of people were celebrating birthdays because we kept hearing the Chili's version of Happy Birthday being sung every 5 mins.  I guess that is why the food took forever to come out.  I wouldn't have minded, but I had the cajun pasta and it was.. okay - some of the pasta was overcooked.  Overall, not the best Chili's experience... maybe it was just a bad night.  This is one of those times where service really effected the food experience for me.
4	qIiuwlndIKUrmNkU7DX1ZA	The atmosphere and service from this restaurant were a welcome change from much of what we received the rest of our stay in Pittsburgh. The staff seemed genuinely friendly and attentive.   The food was good- not outstanding but definitely one of the best meals I had in the city. I ordered salmon, which was cooked perfectly. My friends had the pasta tasting, which for it's price seemed very reasonable. Pasta dishes never impress me the way other dishes do, but teh three offered this night were on the lighter side and a nice variety.  Oh why lie, they each had three servings and I was eating off their plates. That food was gooood!
2	Vd8o26Vtq8HdfZJI5zi4Cw	This is a review of the Subway inside of Walmart on Cactus. Right away, I should realize that anything "inside a Walmart" cannot be that great because they hire Walmart workers to staff the business. There are plenty of flies at every "inside Walmart" location and this Subway is not the cleanest. I have only eaten at subway a handful of times and I never get meat there, only veggies. Well, the veggies and stuff were fresh, but I went for the new spicy Southwestern bread and my mouth was pretty hot throughout this meal. It was not a good combination. Besides that fact, just go to a normal Subway if you must and it will be a better overall experience in theory. Yes, the Bread was HOT...as advertised.
2	fXW3wuN0Mu0004QtFuNQ	I had high expectations of this place, because Omaha Steaks are shipped around the world. However, the quality of the fillet mignon ($32) didn't meet my expectations. The steak was only okay, and a bit dry. They skimped on the mashed potatoes for me as well.. got like half a cup's worth, which was less than the 12oz steak.  The guy sitting to my left ordered medium, and he got a rare.  The waiter will ask you if you want sides, but doesn't tell you that it's an additional $7.  The Omaha chopped salad sucked. I would give it a 2/5. Mostly iceberg lettuce, not much of anything else that was supposed to be there (ham, cheese, eggs, olives). Think of a chef's salad, but worse. You can get a better pre-prepared salad at a grocery store.
4	HF5574PwXBGBzGJIfUuvAQ	We had a great dinner at Baoding ! There were 6 in our party and everyone had a great meal. I had the szchuan chicken and asked if they would substitute broccoli for the red peppers and they graciously complied. Everyone said they had a great meal and that they would order the same thing again! I would highly recommend Baoding.
4	keZyBLfgVLj3WFpOvxQ	Since I'm from CA and married to a Mexican woman, I would have to say this place is pretty good for Charlotte.  I love my local burritos and there was actual flavors at this place.  The carne asada had a lot of flavor and the salsa/guacamole definitely helped add flavor.  In CA this place would get 3 stars, but because I'm in Charlotte it's definitely 4 star worthy.  Good job bringing the flavor to the South!
4	B47SH1KDXtBJSpcTZhZWw	The carne asada torta is great. Terrific flavors, soft bread, tender meat. Actually anything with the carne asada or the carnitas is good. And the ladies in the kitchen and behind the counter are super sweet. It's good place to stop by for lunch or you can phone your order in and they'll usually have it ready within 10 to 15 minutes.
4	QVxQucvphEuVH6NOHTOLsg	Good solid Buffet.   The guy grilling was on top of it. The seasonings bar was need too, you can add whatever you wanted to any of the food. I used some Emeril seasonings on the steak.   The staff was nice, but they started to charge extra for the Beverage bar... drinks are no longer included unless your a kid.
2	qXH4vm6tUbYduycOQDdQ	Inconsistent again. The last 2 hoagies I've gotten here is again only mediocre. The meat doesn't have much flavor and the hoagie sauce tastes like a little olive oil with nothing else, again very plain.  The bread is the best part, which is really sad.  I still like their buffalo pizza better than Franks, but who knows what it's going to be like if quality is slipping.  I guess I will have to go to the deli and pick up the stuff for a homemade hoagie when I feel like having one. For 9 bucks I think I can make a pretty good hoagie for myself and family.
2	ApwdvJvUgP0OFpaCfo9CA	my 2nd time there tonight. Pluses: Our server from the first time remembered us - very nice guy. I like the tasting samplers you can get, the free trivia game and the Tue/Thu specials. BTW, there is NO blue cheese in the extra-charge dressing. The food sounds better than it actually is - not bad, just not great. All in all I guess this is damning with faint praise. I like to look forward to restaurants. Lots of tvs and neon beer signs - I get a nagging premonition that loud sports bars like this will be featured in the Smithsonian some day as an example of our 21st century consumerism ...  oh well, it's close to home and my husband likes it ...
4	994RxoctVhMAZkChVWnssw	I love their breakfast!  Not gourmet, but a nice atmosphere!  The staff is very courteous and never rushes you.  The food always looks and tastes great.  I would tell anyone to go there for a nice time, very homely!  I can't wait to go back!
2	OZOPXybUgDh1I5zxJSJwYQ	The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right?   The decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place.   I ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food.   Yesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am.   I had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad.   I am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...
4	H9SzEcEwXTGhzojs2Ixxjg	My wife and I are regulars at this location for their frozen treats.  I normally put fast food at 2-3 stars, but this place gets the fourth star for two reasons.  First, I'm really impressed with the cheerful attitude by the staff, even though they are often slammed in the evenings.  Second, this place is always neat and clean.  Awesome Blizzards.
4	3kcIc50X748J1PPljv1zg	i've always been and always will be a big fan and follower of lineage, tradition, and history.  primanti is living tradition and history.  no matter what, when in the burgh, you gotta have a primanti sandwich.  every town makes there own sandwich differently, their own hotdog differently, their own hamburger differently, their own barbeque, and their own pizza differently.  primanti is known for its pile of meat, stacked with coleslaw and fries on top, sandwiched between two pieces of italian bread.  these sandwiches are HUGE.  honestly i can't eat more than half of one because they are so filling.  this is a great place to satisfy your munchies.    its a great place to come after you've finished your shopping in the strip.
4	RNN0iajl1A9YDGHe9Dyg	Ahhh, El Pollo Loco. When I tell my coworkers I'm going there for lunch, they stare at me like I am a crazy person. Obviously, they have never been there. First, let me offer a disclaimer *I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THING*. So the 2 piece combo (breast and wing) with sides of coleslaw and rice and flour tortillas is the only thing on the menu I can vouch for. But it is wonderful. I order that and LOAD UP on the spicy avocado salsa, which is amazing. Seriously, I could drink that stuff by itself. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Anyway, I make my own little tacos with rice, coleslaw, their broiled chicken and avocado salsa. It never disappoints.  The staff here has always been kind to me, and you can get in and out of there quickly, which makes it a nice lunch stop. I gave four stars because I wish the restaurant was a little...newer? The bathroom has been closed for repairs a few times that I have been there, so maybe it's time to replace it or something? Either way, I will keep coming back.
4	FpY5dsgUDYnfap9NgPNnQQ	Went for the lunch buffet. The Garlic naan was pretty much the best I had in Phoenix. They had basmati rice, Daal, Palak Paneer (Saag Paneer), Potatoes and Mushrooms, Paneer, Chicken Makhani, Another type of chicken( which was the best dish) and tandoori chicken(not really great). Over all a really good indian buffet in the Phoenix area.  Will probably go back again.
4	7TQnw9PLC7j02wwMgwN5w	Looking for Korean Food? Want Budaejigae? If So, order here! I'm not korean but this is my favorite place for Budaejigae, I've only ordered a couple other things here, and comparatively to the other Korean places in town, this place hands down, has the best Budaejigae. For me personally, I would rather go to woorijib for korean bbq (bulgogi / kalbi) and would definitely come here for the Budaejigae.  Cheap and its huge, definitely can't go wrong if you are looking for a spicy noodle meat soup.
2	TjqwxqQW54NGhYFeub3yA	Expensive drinks.  Loud.  Themed.  Kinda gross.    My real problem with this place is that they do not let you sleep on the floor of the patio, and sometimes when you're in Vegas, that's really all you need.  Not a long nap, but just 3 minutes - power nap.  But no, not at Jimmy Buffet's.  Within seconds there is a team of security around you asking you to take it elsewhere.    Who wants to go somewhere like that?  Not me.
4	UxAlBogZr4GiV5b1LBrPWw	We stopped in at Spinato's the other day and had some thin crust pizza and a baked spaghetti calzone.  All the food was delicious, especially the baked spaghetti calzone, which was something unique. The pizza was a bit too greasy for us, but some people like it that way.  They also had a nice little outdoor patio area, but it was too windy at the time for us to sit there.  Plus, great beer on tap to boot! They carry New Belgium's Fat Tire and Four Peak's Kiltlifter on tap. Thank you!  They have a specific happy hour special for each day of the week, so check out their deals schedule before picking a night to dine there.  We will be back.
2	B73X2yjqWDb3CZsgDGVqKA	Used to go here almost every other day when I first moved up here, for one simple reason it was good (not like the ones back home). Went there the other night and tacos were extremely cold!! Hot dog wasn't as good as before, wasn't bad but wasn't good. If mickeys is one of your options go with the other place, if mickeys is your choice then it's s win either way.
2	flLQzTjS2kYhG5R0wjivzw	So KFC is not exactly the measure of high quality but it is unforgiveable to not give a man the cookie he so rightfully deserves. That is just hitting below the belt. Sure, the chicken tenders were some of the best I've had from KFC in a long time. They were moist and tender on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. The biscuit they gave me was like any other biscuit. It was soft and a little flakey with a salty finish. I have always liked the mashed potatoes and gravy from KFC. Sure, the gravy has gotten pretty thin in the last few years but it still has good flavor. And instant mashed potatoes have such a smooth consistency. Its just too bad that all I got this time was a half a cup. For $5 I guess I can't expect too much from this meal. Maybe I'll come back but, dammit, I better get my cookie!
4	ZOVKjBLW3XrULjYltHoww	I seem to be hanging out in chains lately... and none of them are blowing me away!  This location of Paradise Bakery has one special thing going for it - they have frozen yogurt!  (I don't think any of the other locations have fro yo).  Other than that, this Paradise Bakery is pretty standard.    Located right near the fountains in "the District" area of Desert Ridge (not far from the AMC Theater), you can get consistently ordinary sandwiches and salads here.  I usually go with the walnut chicken salad sandwich or salad - their multigrain bread is not bad but their salad dressings and additional toppings are not anything special.  Pretty average actually...  Paradise Bakery is getting an extra star (increasing my rating from 3 to 4) because they offer cookie cakes that are awesome!  With a couple of hours notice, they will customize your cookie cake and it's always a hit at a party... recently, we ordered a cookie cake for my friend Shauna's birthday - it not only looked adorable, but tasted great too!  Go for the cookies - not necessarily the food!
4	Ya85v4eqdd6k9Od8HbQjyA	Mr Hoagie is an institution. Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.
4	QYxRQ9SE5IYpJebiIDYqlg	My first experience with Ethiopian food was at this restaurant.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, and what came out was definitely not what I was thinking, lol.  Literally it was a giant round plate with a strange looking bubbly/holey bread with what looked pretty much like already-been-chewed meats, vegetables, and lentils.  That's the only way I can describe it.  And on top of that, I got another plate of bread (which turned out to be the injera) with what I can only describe as looking like rags.  To my surprise, this strange looking food was actually quite delicious.  I enjoyed the experience of having to use the injera (bread) to pick up the different meats and such.  The meat and the lentils were very very flavorful and different from anything I'd ever had before.   It's probably not something I could handle eating more than once every couple of months, but it's a great type of food to socialize over and actually kinda fun at the same time :P
4	F7Q4b2LbKYAVI0EyERk0Q	Now known as Milio's....different name, same sandwiches.  Yummy...and they deliver!  I dont' like pizza....so this is definitely my choice convenience food!  It sucks that they only includ lettuce and tomato...but the bread is great, which is key.  I love the Pilgrim's Pride.  They are pretty heavy on the mayo...so watch out.
4	T5eHZlLYQEmu3FYAfRrQlw	Fried Okra and Sweet Sweet Tea!  That's all you really need to know, well at least for me that was really the only things on the menu that I could eat.  This place is big on burgers and chicken sandwiches.  My friend said that his burger was extra juicy with a meaty tomato stacked on top.  Carnivores love it!  The fried okra was great, a staple southern side, and the sweet tea is very sweet.  If you are from the north, don't mess with it start with something a little more bland.  I like my sweet tea to taste like sugar water and lemons.  This is a good place to go for a quick lunch.
4	cVuqVbQQucUXykPHOJzHtg	Mr. Submarine serves basic-duty subs. This is the kind of spot that would have been wiped out by Subway in the 80's, but they keep it going. There's no innovation, just basic subs in a couple of sizes. Choose the meat and bread, whether you want cheese, and a few things to go on top.  I eat there whenever I'm in the area at lunchtime.
4	yhmgX93WupAVZrhZVak2A	The good: Pizza Soup Salads Wings  Not so good: Pasta  I never get the pasta here because from my experience it just isn't great and if I am going to eat pasta I want it to be great.  Other than that it is really good.  The service has always been good.  I would recommend it.
4	RYbZiM4zJy1IwGT50sxdA	We love this relaxed atmosphere. .. the  new menu us superb, so much to choose from. . The 2 for 25.00 menu is budget friendly and fed 3 of us.  Our waiter Keenan was great. He was very thorough and attentive.  We'll worth a dinner the night before Christmas  Eve.
4	HMjestmbgp41sp92qxeYcQ	The food is OK, but the selling point is it is one of the few places in Charlotte that has culture and history.  An old victorian building in a neighborhood that feels more like Charleston than Charlotte.  Tired of uptown chains and overprices bistros, head to this place.  Great beer selection and a pub feel make this a great pick.
2	fZINnr88E0mK1T4ROg	The food here gives a whole new meaning to the word bland.  That makes this an ok place because most anybody could eat what they serve without any complaints.  It is a good place to take a family or for a big eater.  You get food and lots of it.  It kind of makes me think of pigs when you see them at a feeding trough.  What they get may not be good, but they walk away full, happy piggys.  Carlos O'briens sends out lots of happy oinkers!  Did you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).  I debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.  I'd rather be positive than negative so they get three.
4	OoFJlhia3Ron8nrbusuhg	The service was great! Our server was the right amount of attentive and helpful.   We ordered the sizzling rice soup, pretty good- and the large is enough for probably 4 people to share.   Walnut Shrimp = Mayo shrimp ... For those of you reading this that have not tried this amazing Chinese/American psuedo dish, it is one of my favorites. I am a HUGE fan of authentic food from all ethnicities, but every now and then I like to fall back on something like this. My grandma might not have eaten this in China but it is damn good regardless. But I digress- Try it. You like it.   We also got the barbecue pork with veggies. I like snow peas and there were also baby carrots, bean sprouts, and carrots. I thought it was great.   If you like spicy- ask for the chili oil. I like it on everything.   To address some of the reviews that made reference to it being expensive. I don't know where Chinese food go the reputation of being cheap. Maybe it was from all the buffets scattered throughout the state. But Chinese food isn't 'that' cheap when going to a decent sit down type place. Our tab was about $35 for 2 people. This included 1 beer and we had leftovers.
2	UIp9a3Vu7dUktzwTxZVyA	Such a waste. Great little cozy Mexican restaurant for a business lunch that somehow forgot 1) how to make Mexican food and 2) how to cater to larger groups on their lunch break.  You will fall in love with its quaint, wooden interior and carafes of salsa, but the love affair will start to wain once you realize how shoddy and unorganized the service is. It's one of those serve tables by committee places where no one will claim responsibility of any table that's out there. As such, you will go through long stretches without key elements for eating your meal and either be ignored or treated rudely when you ask for help.  But the real deal-breaker for me in my one (and probably final) trip here was the food. I got a "Carne Asada Taco" platter, which turned out to be a loose definition for what I got. There was a stack of four tiny, over-saturated tortillas with some carne asada on it. No guacamole, no pico, or anything else. Just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky, wet tortillas. Also came with almost tasteless beans and rice on the side.  The carne asada itself was really good and some members of my party had slightly better entrees, including the ones who got carne asada burritos which were loaded with guac and such, but we all agreed it wasn't worth the price compared to a trip to Tradiciones, La Tolteca, or even Canasta.  Then we got presented with a bill that included an auto-gratuity of almost 30%. We brought it up to the woman who was running the joint for the most part and took our orders and told her to sort that out. She apologizied and said, "Oh, she can put on whatever gratuity she wants."   Say what? Who is "she"? You are the only one running the register and taking orders. And how can any server just come up with a gratuity of 30%? Needless to say this place is trying to shakedown large business parties and should be avoided as much as possible.
4	QF0hjSGxBHDZnrEfer8MdA	Love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's!  Everytime is as good as the first!  (But also, the red and green sauce has remained the same---fortunately, we have a goodly supply of Arizona Gunslinger Green Sauce at home!)  Please, Filiberto's, we need a location closer to Cave Creek and Carefree!  I promise I'll come order a #17 at least twice a week!
2	RPsHBZGmfHFHi7aOaTROw	I really should have known better-being that I was spoiled in NJ with such fantastic italian food. Once again, another restaurant (chain or family owned) that does not offer chicken francaise! What do I have to do to find some chicken francaise in AZ?! Anyway..food was bland-you have to order pasta seperately? really??? It's not included? what italian place doesn't give you a smidge of pasta? Even olive garden gives you some pasta! Oh well..server was great, so I gave the extra star for the super waiter and I actually love all the kitchy stuff on the walls.
4	WPkdeY55Y2bvQA8AF0enw	For the second time in about a week I slept in and needed to find something to eat on the way.  Last time I got a donut and a bagel someplace else and was disappointed in the bagel.  I had not been in this Einsteins in over 10 years.  Not much has changed, a few more menu items.  I got an onion bagel with salmon schmear.  Much better!  These may not be the best bagels in the valley but are as good as it gets for this neighborhood.
4	Xr3zfODnGFp9f8Doz6bPVA	Hmm, let's see.....a bar with walls full of large TV's, Beer, and good food....yes, I'll take it!  Goldie's is a fun neighborhood bar where you can enjoy watching a game with your friends or family.  During football season, this place can get packed....especially after work on Monday or Thursday nights.  Some food items we've had:  Babyback Ribs w/Fries, $18 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goldies-neighborhood-sports-cafe-scottsdale-2?select=6opOwrvzJcD3Y5VzJTsFlQ#6opOwrvzJcD3Y5VzJTsFlQ  Cheesy Burger, $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goldies-neighborhood-sports-cafe-scottsdale-2?select=eDXT1T0S6WQ_zWuz2lyFow#eDXT1T0S6WQ_zWuz2lyFow  The Thousand Island Burger, $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goldies-neighborhood-sports-cafe-scottsdale-2?select=6yjGoXYrVnUC6AoccLaDOg#6yjGoXYrVnUC6AoccLaDOg  The Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet, $7 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goldies-neighborhood-sports-cafe-scottsdale-2?select=adi-v0MKrJstbTu25c47TQ#adi-v0MKrJstbTu25c47TQ  Their Burgers are huge and delish.  My all time favorite is the Thousand Island Burger.  The Beef is fresh and full of flavor.  Overall, this place is a lot of fun.  It's one of our regular hang outs.  Return Factor - 90%
4	EmnZNxmLoUnsUPN8T8pow	Just found this place recently. Love the fresh food- wow the chicken is great, very heavy on the garlic so make sure you have your breath mints handy if you eat there for lunch on a work day! I thought the place looked clean, despite what some people here have said. Not really what I'd call "a hole in the wall," but just a casual Mom and Pop joint. Perfect for this kind of food.
2	REoVMA6tF6fWVoscDQO5Mg	I really need to start following my instincts. I can usually tell within 2 minutes if I'm going to have to endure crappy service. But, I usually wind up giving it the benefit of the doubt and I stay. A good indicator of this is when the restaurant is half empty but you still don't get any service for 5-10 minutes, and when you do, the waiter tells you he didn't know you were his table. I really should get in the habit of walking out once my indicators go off. Maybe that will be my New Years Resolution.  We went on Sunday night, around 8:30pm. We were seeing "O" at Bellagio at 10:30 and figured it would be a good choice. Food alone, the place is probably 4 stars. The garlic mixture with the bread is quite tasty, my boyfriend enjoyed his caprese salad. The prosciutto wrapped prawns were deliciously salty. My sweetpea ravioli was something totally different and really good. The one miss was my boyfriend's pork roast. Some parts were amazingly delicious, and other parts were dry and inedible. Go figure.  The service really brought the place down. Maybe our server had a long and hard day, who knows. We had to ask for bread, he forgot my order, disappeared for ten minutes at a time, forgot my dessert, and had to be flagged down for the check. Somewhat forgivable in a busy place, but again, that wasn't the case.  Our bill was about $130 for the two of us. 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, no alcohol. Considering how many fantastic restaurants are on the strip, I wouldn't go back.
2	Y3LLPLWwcSdCVTbyZF4Bg	About the same as the other locations for Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, but this one is more convenient to a major highway (I-10).  I wish they would stop making so many menu changes, which are often for the worse.  Food has gone downhill in the last couple years, and beers are rather uninspiring.  For convenience sake I might stop here with low expectations, but if you have the time I'd advise that you seek another dining choice.
2	8DkSJsIOTllI89M8RZb3A	So the crew trainer was great but I could see she was exhausted and tired.  Ok that's cool I know these kind of jobs, they run them to the ground.  But when I got my 2nd order filled by a shift manager, I looked her straight in the eye and asked if she put the BBQ sauce in the bag.  She said yes she did.  She lied and by the way she look at me when I asked, she knew she didn't know the answer.   Is it not better to check then to lie?
2	00K7dBy8o31jHT4ttqQLg	I went here only for a cinnabon.  It's $3.45 for one cinnabon so I expected it to be awesome.  It was my first time there and my pregnancy craving was going nuts for a cinnabon.   I ordered, the no smile, no welcoming feeling of the server (completely zombified) boxed up my cinnabon and I went on home.  I was so bummed, I opened the box and it is all dry and was a depressed, pathetic little cinnabon.  It was so fun eating it, I almsot had to force it down my throat it was so dry!   Next time, I am going to go to Ikea to get a cinnamon roll where it is huge, only costs $1.. warm, ooey gooey with icing and loaded calories and is like Christmas morning in my mouth..
4	6kTFSykVHjWqYDGo1jidg	I love breakfast and I love The Farm House. It is a bit cramped and busy but since I'm usually dining solo, the counter always has a place open. The daily special scrambles are very tasty and each order comes with home fried potatoes and whole wheat french bread. The coffe is also very good as well as they use Illy coffee. One thing to look out for if you sit at the counter is that you come face to face with two of their fresh made chocolate cakes. It takes every inch of my will power not to order a slice, but alas chocolate cake has won out a couple of times.
4	3zrewvY07gLa1DH2HC4ZsA	The food is fantastic for the budget Mexican category. This favorite (or favorito) is in my neighborhood and is a regular stop. I prefer not to eat there (unless you get turned on by fluorescent lights and beat up furnishings). No, I prefer to eat my Favoritos at home. I have heard that some folks take their meal next door to the Tally Ho (a dive bar) and enjoy their tacos with a cold Corona! Crazy!  Nachos covered with cheese and Jalapeos for only $2! Tacos and tostadas of perfection. They also have a mini salsa bar with several dimensions of heat and flavor.
2	BXiSmcEU3efdEM9lnrnwQ	This is simply okay strip mall Italian. Does it beat the rest of the suburban feedlot fare - olive garden, cheese cake, etc? Yes. But, not by much. I'd say that they ingredients used are sub-par, or - more likely - purchased at the safeway next door.  We had pizza and the spaghetti dish. Pizza was so-so. Spaghetti dish tasted like canned sauce over ordinary pasta. The menu isn't creative, but it caters well to the Glendale / Peoria market.  Oh, and the bread and olive oil couldn't be less ordinary. They have cooking-grade (or worse) olive oil. And, the bread - the night I went - was cold and fairly stale. Surely not made the same day.
4	AHYkvpCFMGDCVt7G1NZjOA	I'm not usually big on chinese, but this place is doing it right! Nice clean feel upon entering, and I was promptly greeted by a friendly man whom I would guess is the owner.  The menu was easy to read, and the prices are fair. I ordered won ton soup and moo goo gai pan.  Both were great!  Would definitely recommend to friends!
4	oPubj6eIPx70HQ2vhkE6Gg	Good, quick, tasty Indian food. They always have the buffet going and it's great to stop in and grab a quick belly stuffing. It's tucked inside a days inn of all places but location is of no concern. Very wide range of food and sides. So, so good. Decent prices too. Always friendly.
4	CBf5Fok6pxw5EpO7rWZ2Eg	Randomly wandered into this fine establishment on a Wednesday night. Great setting to watch some playoff action with a beer at the bar. Bartender was friendly and quick. Atmosphere chill. Decorations were right on for an Irish pub.
2	0qXsgtyJlNvCTtte5wWcBg	My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie.   The waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's "charm"?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.  Televisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.  This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally.
4	HPEXeQTXNPf14XzBQvGOw	I only ding it a star for the singing.  As with all of this style restaurant they do the obnoxiously loud birthday singing that makes you have to pause your conversation and wait, and wait...and...they seem to average 3-5 birthdays per meal that I have there.  How about a little cake and candle and a nice simple, "Happy birthday!"  The food is great and there is a variety of dishes...something to please everyone...vegetarians, experimental eaters, the burger guy, and me -- the picky one.   Dan mentioned that he didn't like the fancy stuff -- they actually have a big thing on their menu that asks you to just tell them how you want it -- you can pick out what type of bun, what goes on it, etc.  So...if you don't want a fancy bun, ask for a plain one, no one bats an eye.  They have a dangerous thing -- unlimited french fries.  For a whopping 49 cents you can make them unlimited garlic fries.  Also...if you ask they will bring you a side of onion straws or fries while you wait for your meal...so far they've always been free.
4	Lbd1nrZB8HXC1py30dBI6w	We've been going to Cervantes Restaurant for years now. Me and my co-workers head here for lunch whenever we are wanting some Mexican food. The restaurant is located in a run down plaza which can turn some people off. In fact, I was prejudiced against it when I first visited it because of that, but we've been back many times.  All I've ever gotten is the ground beef tacos. They are some of the best. It is hard to find a place that does ground beef in their tacos. Most of the time restaurants do shredded beef which I hate.  The burritos that everybody else gets look good but I haven't ever tried one. Cervantes isn't one of those Mexican restaurants that flood the plates in beans or cheese. You can tell that they care how the food is prepared.  The service is good. The owner guy and his wife are amiable. You pay up at the front before you sit down and eat which makes check splitting for large groups easy. They bring you chips and salsa. Not a big fan of the chips, but they are free.   If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant in Tempe you should try Cervantes. Some people like it and some people don't. But I like it, it is good for lunch.
4	LAKPbEolS9uGS845bvTtw	My boss is Indian and we decided to try and find a good Indian restaurant while in Az. We loved this place. We went back twice! Delicious food and wonderful service.  They have a facebook page with coupons.
4	BYHbAOigkPK1cofZ5JSMjQ	It was blind luck that I stumbled across ceviche over 10 years ago as a young lad living in Los Mochis, Sinaloa.  Since then it has become a signature dish in my heart and I've gone out of my to find restaurants whose reputations are tied to this savory dish from the sea.   I was excited when I recently read a piece in Phoenix Magazine lauding the ceviche of Salvadoreno as one of the essential dishes of the valley.  I soon headed east to determine whether or not this dish would rival my favorite versions of the dish; the beach side shack outside of Topolobompo and the Halibut Ceviche of the Foundry Grill up at Sundance in Utah. We were greeted by the friendly yet chaotic smile that it so common with Latin American dives.  We quickly ordered some horchata, very strong, and some pupusas, above average, before we prepared to dine the reason for our visit. I certainly wasn't disappointed.  My only real hang up was their interpretation of what a portion should be.  The dish could serve 4 people without a problem.  The ingredients were standard to ceviche and all tasted very fresh.  The only slight difference was that the shrimp on top were grilled.   We finished the meal with Nuegados de Yuca con miel, fried but not too heavy, and called it a meal.  While it wasn't the best ceviche it was certainly among the top tier.  The restaurant is just close enough to warrant a semi regular visit.  A great place that deserves your attention.  Just remember that when you order the ceviche bring a friend or three along for the ride.
2	U507CLp58lZYwzORbvoeeQ	Sorry, but I have been to Showmar's several times and can't climb aboard the Love Train like so many locals.  It isn't unpleasant, but the ambience is meh, the food is meh, the price isn't a wallet-buster, but there are other places I can think of which are comparable in price and superior in taste.  Props, though, to the staff, which is very attentive. I honestly have no huge gripe with Showmar's, just a distinct lack of being wowed. Perhaps my minority view should be seen as just that; I don't get opera, either, and the fact that opera has been around for centuries would indicate it is my failing and not opera's.
4	IkTbB0XD7UWrOi2Eghgg	The salad bar is legit!   Fresh, crisp veggies, variety of cheeses, egg, grilled chicken, homemade dressings AND they have brick oven cheese pizza, soups and a baked potato section. All you can eat for $5 plus drink purchase.   Why do I choose this place over the "Sweet Round Red Things" place?  -No wait usually. Great service. -No screaming, coughing maniac kids rubbing boogers on the booths -It's dark, but light enough to read -If I am with someone who doesn't do salad bars they can order a burger and I can steal their fries:)  It's nothing fancy, but it's just right for me when I am eating clean.
4	FPPhUgyQPJYcKwbok8RIQ	Went here a couple Fridays ago to go to for lunch. Pretty cool place and the food was pretty good. I had the sausage platter, sauerkraut, coleslaw, and red cabbage...mmmmm! I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes. My only complaint is that the beers were a little small.
2	0tY24BRBNWVK7kw4EOB3cg	2 Stars because of the ambiance (artwork), the manager was very accommodating and the service was really good. The food wasn't what it should have been for its Michelin-star rating. I did the tasting menu and I found all the dishes to be pretty bland.
4	LuqUi9dWf2FfIg794YpcQ	The place is not cheap, but it is worth it.  The best way is to go in and let the chef and owner pick your food.  You'll eat some crazy thing you would have never ordered and love it.   If you are a weekly sushi eater, this place might get a little pricey.  If you want to experience the full range of Japanese food, this is the place.
4	XeBjkvuCVSdbuvPu8vbyQ	I brought my iced coffee here for an exchange because it tasted bad. Sofia did everything she could to get it right. She made a new one, that didn't work, she offered to put more caramel. That didn't work, she offered a different kind. That didn't work. But the entire time, she didn't give me attitude or get annoyed with me because she had to keep remaking it. She even apoloigized. Hell it could've been me, but she said, it could be we need to remake the coffee.  She was very helpful - Thank you!
2	MDQdFThRpecgr9MaXPg	We had breakfast today at 10AM--after going to the swap meet.  So we were late, ... and there wasn't a crowd here.  And we see why.   Service at the door is ok.  Service at the table slow, and slow deliver of requested water, and ... of our food order.  The food was perfectly good--except it was luke warm.  We thnk it was sitting up there.  The restaurant was not busy, and not even half full.  Yet the tables across from us were left dirty and unbussed the entire time of our visit.  Very unappealing.  Mostly the food delivery was slow, the male waiter was slow, the food was luke warm.  Scrambled eggs were way overcooked and crumbled into small pieces.  Brown all over as in extra well done.  We did not complain.  We just will not be coming back.  I predict this chain as closing in the future--and it wont' be because of the economy, it will be because of mediocre service and staff.  It will be like what happened to Marie Calendars.  See ya!
2	2AVIcHyG6jQqimQbH3fn2w	Let me just say that I love breakfast food and generally when I eat out with my boyfriend, it's for breakfast.  The food wasn't bad, it was a typical mom n' pop type of restaurant... But the atmosphere inside was very sad. Plus there was no music playing overhead or in the background. So you were left to hear he mumbles of the elder while they were linking their forks and spoons on their dishes. Our waitress (who was the only server) looked like she was bothered by the fact we came into this restaurant. She was not very friendly. Which is okay, some days I hate going to work too, but at least make me feel like I'm not eating at a hole in the wall.   Like I said the food wasn't bad, it was typical breakfast food, but don't think you can bring a few friends or your family and feel a homey kind of feel you can get at several other restaurants in the easy Valley.  Decent food, however, will not return.
2	f7LqA9MFZpCTCIKqgEConw	This is one of the very few food places near where we live.  While it's not a particularly great pizza place, it's not bad either.  There are tables inside and the staff is generally friendly.  They have a nice-sized LCD on one wall where patrons can watch whatever game is on.  The pizza is serviceable, though not remarkable.  They serve lunch and have quite a few specials.  We probably get pizza from here once or twice a month.
2	eYlE54qUfJ7EOXLpHuWm9w	Ordered 2 items for my husband and myself over the phone. They didn't take his name or phone number etc. When he arrived 15 mins later the food wasn't ready, our order was no where to be found (shocker).   The food was ok I guess.  We've decided to find another place to go instead.
4	KditIrB6vIff5B2ZF5KOgA	Good food and better music ... A great hang out place... I wont certainly recommend it for a 3 course dinner or such, but definitely a great place to get together with some of your good ol'd buddies... And yeah, chicken wings are awsome !!
2	4MXeBUvfX38JeOrs3F8Tg	McDonald's is McDonald's. My "beef" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas!   (See http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-restaurants-phoenix-44#hrid:jpfxQUBZMuBoIIFn-MWp7g)
4	lqAWN6fBAVHrJABAyYVoiw	I've been there twice now and had excellent service.  Had 3 friends with me who all liked their dish.  3 out of the 4 dishes were amazing while the 4th was good but nothing to be happy about.  gemeli was great.  and my chicken f alfredo was great as well.  Bread and pesto was great too for the price you are paying on the meal.  I will be going back more often.  Once a week.
4	QkNFdXcgXDy7gm8QuZIVQ	The Good Egg is good! Shocker! You usually have to wait because it gets pretty busy, but the food is good, the service accommodating, and the atmosphere reminds me of a country home for some reason. Think of it is a notch up from Denny's. Which includes a little price increase, but it's still affordable. It's not a place I usually go because the waits were a little ridiculous and it's full of big loud families and old people.
2	09zVxZ1r3ZyzeN99JOk9gw	We ordered take-out from this place and the only plus was that it came pretty quickly. Other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce. Pretty cheap too - we ordered online and we were able to order something free for every $10 you order, but this is not good enough for me to go back to this place again.
2	miiIxI95ZhMW84H2J7dzw	We stopped on a Friday afternoon about 2:30pm and was greeted by a waitress/hostess and asked for a half table half booth, me and the misses can't agree on tables. We were informed that was not possible, those were being saved for a large group coming in soon. We place our order, ate, and no big group ever showed up, as we were getting ready to leave a young family was seated at these tables, they were a big group of three. I like the food but the next time I am lied to by the cheap help they can stick the business up their waazoo!
2	gLUN2593yb3pSp6QTtPzjA	Staff was friendly although they I watched one girl commit a health code violation by putting olives back into the tray that had been fallen off someone's sandwich. Now the taste wasn't great, the avocado doesn't taste fresh. The Bacon doesn't have any taste. All in all, one of the reasons I stopped going to Subway.
4	DDkKI6mNiA9utTtNFtqpQ	This is a great place for lunch.  Everytime we go we always see firefighters and police which means that it is good and cheap!  I found the food very fresh and the hummas was great.  Almost eveyrthing is homemade.  I did try the chicken sandwhich and found the chicken kinda dry, but the freshaness of everythign else makes up for it.  Definatly reccomend this place if you are around downtown for lunch... but with the consturtion now it is kinda pain to get to, but worth it!
4	1tfl7nfecGr7F6wDhMnlw	A great upscale sports bar/pub. The food was pretty good and they had fresh baked pie!!!....not a regular thing on a pub menu....try their Fish and Chips!!! oh they hit the spot.  Sport a seat in one of their booths near the front so you can see the flat screen tvs - service was good too. Always a great place to stop in on the Camelback corridor.
2	gr3Rw8mn6tpOz0ifPCV4ZQ	Typical breakfast/lunch cafe tucked away in a business plaza oriented to fast convenient lunch for working stiffs who need to grab a quick bite and get back to to a job.  Fast service. I never have to worry about getting back to work on time when I go here.   Food is very basic. Mainly sandwiches and chips and soda.   Portion sizes are a bit smaller here. Positive spin: "Just the right size to keep me going for the afternoon while not weighing me down." Negative spin: "Gee, there's sure not much meat on this sandwich and there's only tomato on one half."  If you're very hungry you probably want to visit the Arizona Sandwich Company down the street instead.   Drink refill's must be paid for, and I regularly get way too much ice in my first drink. Too often I leave thirsty because I don't want to pay for the refill.  There's a nice patio outside to get some fresh air with your lunch.
2	nd2DsvpPpxZOaRzaJnXaAQ	I was excited to find a Popeyes here is AZ. The ones I used to go to in Louisiana were good. They had etouffee and mardi gras cheesecake that were great. This one is awful. The chicken was old and not fresh. The red beans and rice were runny. It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.
4	Cj6B7qNiiImGhNMiP0LCBA	Wow ~ what a busy place, especially on a Sunday morning ~ yet even with the rush of people the staff stayed pretty friendly and the food came out quickly.  Einstein Bagels has really stepped up their game ~ they have coffee bar drinks that rivel Starbucks  . . . their latte may actually be better : )  PLUS you can refill your cup with their drip coffee that tasted fantastic.  They are now featuring new lite and healthy selections featuring bagels that on 1/2 the thickness to save on calories.  I tried their veggie with mushrooms and asparages.  It was terrific!  Competition is good sometimes ~ in this case having several other breakfast locations in the area has really invited Einsteins to step up and re-invent itself.  It's exciting to see their rebirth and growth.  Blessings : )KC
2	yxBoeSJaPrzTZXoh9dYjw	I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be.   I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a "fresh" plate.   My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a "fresh" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting.   A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine!   The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes!   If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos.
2	Uv89eQaAKNr2Gyn1W6W7IQ	It drives me nuts how every time I order a taco or burrito without the sauce, they still go right ahead and put the sauce on it.  Not some of the time, or most of the time, but every single time.  Sometimes, with the tacos, they even cover it up with extra cabbage or lettuce on top so I don't see it until I get home.  For that reason, I usually order the chicken or steak street tacos since they don't come with that gross white sauce that they put all over their seafood items.  But every once in a while I feel like a shrimp or fish taco and invariably when I get home with my takeout and taste my first bite, I realize that they put the d#!@ sauce on there.  I don't like tarter sauce or mayo or any of those creamy sauces.  I don't know why they put it on there in the first place since they have the yummy salsas for you to add to your food to your own liking.  Which leads me to another complaint that I have.  The last few times I have been to this Rubio's, they are out of the spicy carrots.  Nothing left in the container except jalepenos and liquid.  And one time I got some of the chopped onion and I could tell after one bite that it had gone bad.  A little more attention to the condiments, please!  Get it together guys, or I will stop coming here. Even though it really convenient, if I can't eat my food when I get takeout or have to wait around while you make it twice when dining in, then why would I want to return?
4	529w8phrCyF4v0v2R43ExA	So on my trip to Phoenix my friend and I decided to try this BBQ spot,I remember seeing it on The Food Network about a year or so ago,but never paid no mind since I never travel to Phoenix. Anyhow, I tried the Steak and Mashed Potatoes while my friend tried the Full Slap of Pork Ribs, I did order my meat Medium Well, It came out Well Done, no worries, since i do enjoy my meat regardless. I tried the pork ribs and they were really good, i did read the reviews about this place prior to heading to AZ, but i never really believe until i try for myself. Well, I have found a nice place to stop when in town, The service was good, and the portions were great. The place is a bit overwhelming with Pig Stuff, but still cool in it's own way. BTW, the corn bread is really good,could be better as to what my friend mentioned, but i thought it was fine.  Try it out for yourself, it's well worth the stop!
4	L05qPgrJFnlcDZleJaNQA	My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try.
2	YG0W2witHvXIQOwPRXHeg	1st, they were out of what I ordered. On a Friday. At lunch time. Next, they didn't do anything to make it better. They just switched my ravioli for plain pasta and charged me the same amount, even though plain pasta is almost 4 dollars cheaper, they still charged me the ravioli price. When my updated order got to me, they put the wrong sauce on my pasta too. The delivery itself was great, really fast and the guy was nice. Hence the two stars.
2	eJcodb7nZtYNZ3r1MvDbA	The food is ehh. Only good when drunk really. My main issue is that the night crew, especially Friday and Saturday night, are the greediest people ever. Their card reader almost always conveniently goes down. Given the fact that I live right next to it, I often attempt to stop after a night of drinking with hopes that things will be different. No luck. They take an hour to make a burrito, and that's if I have cash on me. They pocket the money, it's a common practice, but I've never seen it done so often. Ask for a receipt, I guarantee they can't provide one.
4	YStaEXSUkWBG0qUV3LyZw	I went this afternoon and had a great time. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice, and my lunch (the Baja pizza) was very good.   The only downside were the chips, which tasted bland and even a bit stale. The accompanying salsa mostly masked that, but not entirely.
4	TBvMVYXvqUn49iDyQRWrJw	Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month, I really do love Quiet Storm and I will be sure I hit it up next time I'm in town visiting my friends there. The decor is adorable. The prices are reasonable. It was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. It's truly a unique space.
2	CXhuKXlCLFKm8k2salOdHg	Very lousy hamburgers and service was awful. I had heard this place was good for years but was disappointed. I had a movie ticket and they refused to give me my 10% discount. Employees speak little or no English and have poor customer service skills.
4	6HHrqne1BNj6SOoeDf8eA	So I just got back from taking a solo trip over to Star of India.  I was craving some comfort food, something simple, but yummy, something that would cheer me up on a cloudy day. Something that would make me feel less loser-ish because my lunch buddy had taken the day off and I had to eat solo....cha-ching... Star of India fit perfectly!   I chose to do the buffet because it had everything that I liked. I don't claim to be an expert of Indian cuisine, but I love the sauces and gravies and the rich flavors that are used.   The naan was HOT and fluffy and I scooped up everything with it!  Like I said, this place is nothing fancy, but it was clean and my waitress was friendly. Plus, it made me feel a little less loser-ish.
4	DDKTv798Dd8I4yUCyhkcRA	Good for lunch or dinner plus they have free parking in their garage. When you are at the ballet or opera eat here and park for free.  All the food except for the fries (frozen) that I have had here was very good.
2	SDNd0OwUHw2NaZuS6iQy2g	Imperial Garden has been around a long time and seems to be a local favorite. That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case. The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s. I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now). It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P. F. Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years).
2	nNodZMVjwskZ3A3kU9N8GA	I was really excited to try this place because of the good reviews, however I was disappointed. When we first arrived there was nobody waiting and only 2 tables had people at them however we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. When we finally got a seat we ordered drinks from the bar they were out of three different things we ordered. The food was not that good. My chicken was dry and the chef popped hot oil on me and burnt me. Food was definitely too pricey for the quality. The sake was good and the staff was friendly but I would not recommend.
4	3JGxV5sjDmcx4msBB0s2g	For those of you who have been to Nakato before you know that it is separated into two rooms, the sushi bar and the grill room where the chefs cook the food for you.  My experience here has only been in the sushi bar, and it was a pretty good one.    The sushi itself was very good, fresh and really big.  It was a mouthful to eat a whole piece.  Plus I'm beginning to think it's kind of hard to mess up spider rolls, but then again I may just be spoiled.  Then there was the udon soup.  It was really good, but not any better or worse than other udon I've had.  I was kind of impresses that they had one of my friend's favorite foods, inari, that came with the soup.
4	pbyw6sdczIT0AfcVixO2g	Remember to suck in your gut when entering and exiting this place. It doesn't bode the largest establishment around, and if you show up at the wrong time you might be sitting outside in the sun in anticipation.   I have been to this place several times and have not been disappointed once. I would suggest something for you to try, but I can't decide on any specific thing that is better than the other. The cup of sweet toast is a must try. My face literally melted off in delight. The burgers and fresh-cut fries are in my personal epic category. The egg sandwich is ridiculous. Really the only knock to this place is it's size. If I didn't need a crowbar to get myself out of the building each time I go, then it might be better.   Seriously people, go here. Eat here. Revel in your trip to the land of gluttony. I love this little cramped trailer and it's treasure trove of goodness.
4	3RUalvVZmZhtbYV7VtXjBw	I was out one night looking for the best Karaoke place west of Buckeye and this is it. The KJ inspired me to sing songs out of my comfort range and had a upbeat attitude the whole night he kept the energy high and knows how to work the crowd. what I liked best is that he didn't mind staying late as long as the crowd was having fun come out and check out the show.
4	FruSDNcclcDU3L8ONxR9Q	Loved this place for what it is . . . An old time, steel city, Market Square, fried seafood & beer spot that has not changed a bit since the days your great grandfather frequented as a young steel worker!  Not a date place!    Stopped in before an afternoon Pirate game with the guys for lunch and then walked back to PNC.   The food and beer were served quickly and quite tasty.  Must try a fried oyster. I've never had one quite like this!  All in all a fun taste of Pittsburgh!!  Will go back!
4	tnpYjAewjZjlbV4wShhS6w	During my kitchen remodel I ate at pizza hut a lot more than I ever intended to. It actually got to the point where the guy working knew who I was. I don't remember the mangers name but he's a cool dude and once when there was an issue with a payment he helped me out. Now that my kitchen is done I don't eat there often but I do make sure to buy a pizza at least once a month with those guys.
4	E9An4sNiVOXuTPhzgwTLqg	Awesome place. Have been having weekly breakfast with my daughter for 10 years now. Huge omelets, awesome coffee and one of the better cheese burgers around for that price range. I know every time I walk in that I will have a great meal.
4	d0f24y4tihjRlnJNmdF79A	my brother and i did a drop in on a wednesday night in june.  the place was nearly packed (with asians) and people kept streaming in during the 1.5 hrs of eating some of the tastiest pho.  how many places in AZ can boast those kind of numbers?  if you go there, ask for Lauren or her sister  (daughter of the owners).  the other waitresses are all really friendly but don't usually speak as much english and usually will refer you to one of the sisters anyways.  our 1st time there, Lauren stood at our table what seemed like 20 mins pleasantly and patiently describing all the dishes we were curious about.  she wasn't looking over our shoulder at other customers and she seemed to enjoy talking to us.  we've eaten at the old place next to Lee Lee, cyclo and this place is as good if not better and the service is exemplary of what a great dining experience should be.  i reserve 5 stars for restaurants in heaven, so this one gets 4.96 stars
4	5eb7IXv56XMCi8NyxTg	This place was really cool. Went for lunch today with a friend who is a regular there. The place was not busy at all at around 1 which was nice, we got our order in and sat down right away. The cashier was really nice, took our order, was friendly and seems to be really appreciative for regulars.   Both my friend and I got the Thanksgiving sub which rocked.... you could pretty much put cranberry sauce on anything and I would eat it, but this I really enjoyed every bite of. It's basically a turkey sub with cranberry sauce and a sage aioli- bomb-diggety!  All in all, two sandwiches with sides and two drinks was $17.50ish- about the same as a couple footlongs from subway which is cool. The atmosphere is nice, laid back with good music, the people check in with you, but not so much that it's annoying, so points there too.   I am looking forward to stopping in again for coffee!
4	3oQiXuLzvtWBJseiPhCw	I really enjoyed my pizza at Monical's. To me, having eaten here during my graduate school days. A schoolmate advised me to ask for their French dressing on my pizza. It was absurd, of course, but tasted fantastic. Now I won't get it any other way. Thanks for the memories, Monical's.
2	XIeRfSsfYN2MuJs9d2Uqw	Because someone highly recommended this place, we tried to have dinner here while it was still located on 7th Street.  We opened the door, looked in, and walked out.  Food might have been good but the place was just one of those joints that time forgot.  I would have overlooked the ambiance had I thought the food was going to compensate.  Didn't think that was possible so we didn't stay.    Fast forward several years later - the place has now moved (to yet another dicey location).  We decided to give it another go because the reviews on Yelp are so good.  Food was edible.  I just don't get being served spaghetti with marinara sauce with veal piccata (which has lemon and capers).  And I especially dislike spaghetti that has the mushiness of Chef Boyardee.  Even Old Country Buffet is better than this and they don't charge $16 for the plate.  Hubby's sausage and peppers dinner was also edible, but value was definitely missing.    Sadly, I didn't get a taste of the delicious bread mentioned by Jason B.    So what are the alternatives for Italian food close by?  Pino's on Thomas Road and Central has awesome food in a down home kind of environment.  Aiello's on Central and Camelback has better food and ambiance for maybe a buck more per plate.    Bar seems pretty cool for the "right" crowd.
2	1IPYMCemW6FV9LlgUbQSyw	My co-worker and I decided to make a change for lunch today and hit Arby's. We're not strangers to Arby's but I wouldn't say were regulars either so we decided to take a look at the online menu. I found a Market Fresh Farmers Chopped Salad that looked pretty good so decided to order that. When we arrived at Arby's they tell us they don't have any such salad. Now with Yum brands at least their restaurant websites will tell you "at participating locations" this Arby's location offered no explanation. Now because my co-worker and I split the bill for lunch when we return to the office amongst each other a receipt is required to do so. Well no receipt either. If that wasn't enough, when it was time to dig in and eat we also discovered that the Arby's sauce we requested was non-existent... My alternate food choice was amazing but the service and experience.. meh.
2	UJuIv3IE2hWG6zsOPnFbg	I have to subtract a star because I just don't care for the new menu.  I guess they are trying to be more healthy to compete with Subway.  But they still have the same calorie laden sauces, most of the sandwhiches come with mayo by default, and fatty meat (which apparently now is hormone-free which is a good thing).  Just adding extra tomato and lettuce after it goes thru the toaster does not make it healthy.  And now instead of being toasty and bubbly with cheese, they are lukewarm with cold veggies.  Yuck.  And what's up with loosing the cantina chicken and the few other selections I actually liked?  Yes, I could "build my own" but I don't want to think on my lunch break.  I just want to order and have you make it for me.  Just give me my Cantina Chicken Sammie, dammit.  They have lost everything that previously made them better than Subway.  The only thing keeping them from one star is the fact that they still have Sunchips and the zero calorie pink grapefruit SoBe.
4	5FvobTwQAv9o3NwHROmwCA	How can you argue with a $5 meal? There's better pizza out there, but at 3 times the cost. Definitely the best bet for feeding a family. I've actually grown fond of their pizza. They have an online coupon that will get you free sauce your breadsticks. There's a wait about fifty percent of the time, but it doesn't last more than 3-5 minutes. Usually it's not because of the employees, it's because some dim-wit at the front of the line can't decide what they want to order...at a place that only has about six different things you can order.
2	AYKogl5rJA1lI525Q5IHzg	After seeing all the good reviews and seeing the sign saying they have been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives we were pretty excited to try this place. We had attempted to try out Waffles INCaffinated, but the wait was 1.5 hours.  We ate here on a fairly busy Sunday morning, there was no real room to wait while they were cleaning the table, and every time the door opened the cook?/owner?/maybe manager? would yell "CLOSE THE DOOOORR!!!!", as loud as he possibly could.  When we sat down, it took at least ten minutes for someone to come give us menus. I ordered coffee (the menu cites only one free refill ,which is weird). The breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated. If you don't want eggs for breakfast, definitely don't come here. Our order was fairly simple (as there aren't many options), but our food took at least 45 minutes to come. When it finally did, it did not all come together but rather very staggered over many ten minutes or so. I got an egg english muffin sandwich which was extremely comparable to what I could have made at home. Does not come with anything...Nothing was remarkable.. plates, mugs and silverware did not exactly look the cleanest. There was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug.  Annnnyway, wasn't thrilled. Prices are VERY cheap, but you get what you pay for...Will not be back.
2	IMS05RfY9IdLdty9nYuw	I was very, very disappointed in this place. The food is way overpriced for the quality. We ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible. Our waitress was also terrible. Slow and inattentive. If I go to a fine dining restaurant, I want/expect great, great food and attentive service. I absolutely did NOT get that here. Don't waste your money. Go to the Melting Pot instead. Awful.
2	TPIoaNyF0qsnYWNvnA	First time in this location. I've ordered crispy tacos take away. When I got home and open the bag it dripped unbelievable amount of oil. On the sofa and on my clothes. The tacos was soaking wet with oil. But the pickled carrots are good. Don't order crispy tacos!  I love Robertos tacos but not this location.
2	MxZ3NHWosUoCBpO9WypieA	C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.  This is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.  Nice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry.
4	4fzKMgo9TVW76lvoEuAIw	I had the best meatball sub I've ever had today. The sauce was phenomenal, I kick myself for not finding this mom and pop family place sooner. I can't wait to go back to try something else...can't miss with this place its awesome.
2	S8mhN9IXUyjaI9RLoKIotg	The food here is simply awful.  It's low quality and very disappointing.  I had a coupon to the place a few years ago and I was looking forward to enjoying some spaghetti, soup, salad, and all that other stuff you see in the commercials.  Nope.  Really bad stuff.    I've eaten at other Olive Garden's around the country over the past decade or so, and my experiences have universally been very bad.  In the realm of chain restaurants, I'd much prefer Chili's, Bennigans, Outback Steakhouse to Olive Garden.  Maybe chain Italian is just bad.  I also really don't like Macaroni Grill.    For some people, it appears inconceivable that anyone could dislike the food here.  If you do - you're labeled a snob.  So defensive... tsk tsk.
2	VoKwrgl2jX74Ul89vjqWw	The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!
2	YfcZZU9nU2aKXcjENZ3PLg	Upon arriving for our 7 PM reservation we were escorted to a table in the back of the restaurant where there was a party of 16 already seated and it was loud.  There were only a couple of tables occupied in the front room.  We asked for another table and were told they were all reserved - why couldn't one of them be ours? We had a reservation.  Finally we were given a table by the door.    We were given water and served a bread basket of dry white bread.  We ordered house salads which were very small and very boring.  We all ordered chicken dishes which were OK - nothing special.  Nothing impressed us - food or service.
4	4iDZqzWgvC0qdyn6kqc4Rg	After going to the Chin's on State St. I was pretty sure I'd never go to Chin's again. But this location is close to my work and a coworker invited me. Perhaps I am also weak?  Anyway I was pleasantly surprised to find that, for whatever reason, the food here seemed much better. It could maybe be argued that the noodles are a little heavy on the sauce, but everything else seemed fine. The tofu and veggies are well prepared and chewable (not the case on State St!) and really that's all I need.  In addition the staff is always pleasant and the food comes out quickly.
2	J5eyW2cynStxoxtf5zq0w	I ordered 2 things & when I got to the window young Anna recited only one item to me to confirm my order, I corrected her, and her dead eyes locked with mine and said "oh....." Awkward pause "yeah"....... In short,  I hope she was just really stoned because if not she possessed the personality of a tube sock.  Food was good.
2	xQgcvJyX1GuCfjJeui64fg	I have been here a few times and every time I regret it. The service is beyond slow. Literally waited over an hour yesterday morning to be served 2 omelets. I was late for somewhere else I needed to go because of the ridiculously slow service. It wasn't even that busy so no excuse. When I questioned and asked the waitress where the food was because it was an extremely long time since we ordered and I had to be somewhere, she checked and said he just got yours started. Mind you, this was after already waiting 45 minutes. Won't go back unless I have all morning to waste.
2	hlBECcWAAaR9pRwCAaileg	I wanted to like this place. I really did. A rice bowl is something fairly easy to do right, and I can't say that Shogun Express did so. It's unfortunate, because they're one of my favorite quick and easy dinners and I would have eaten here often if it had been even slightly palatable.  I got a fried tofu and veggie rice bowl and just about everything except the teriyaki sauce was below par. The rice wasn't the yummy sticky rice- it was just bland and squishy. The breading around the tofu tasted like raw flour and the only "veggie" I got was broccoli (which was at least not over cooked)  I only managed to force down half of it.   My friend who ordered a hibachi steak teryiaki bowl suffered from crippling stomach pains later in the night. Plus, he said the meat was chewy and low quality.   I don't think I'm going back any time soon. The only thing that makes that a possibility is Jennifer's review that said their salads were amazing... If they make them without chicken I might be willing to give that a try.
4	b6C5PnsIw6myJWelKwVDJA	After pigging out in SF for 10 days I made Gabi K promise to only take me to healthy restaurants during my trip to Phoenix. As soon as she picked me up from the airport she made good on that promise by taking me to Taylor's for lunch.  I was leading towards ordering a fresh fruit bowl or maybe even a yogurt parfait when Gabi started raving about their tuna that's made with yogurt! How's that for healthy? And so I ordered this tuna in a wheat wrap (instead of the regular bread). My side choices were fries, greens, and sweet potato fries.  Since I'm trying to be healthy I knew I should get the greens, but turning down sweet potato fries is just silly! And so I ordered the sweet potato fries, which at least are healthier than regular fries! Well, my sweet potato fries never came to the table because the waitress soon informed me that the kitchen was out of sweet potato fries. A sign that I should have ordered those greens in the first place!  The tuna wrap lived up to expectations and we received top notch service (thanks to our waiter Michael) throughout our meal.  I started to think I was in SF instead of Phoenix when the homeless man outside started soliciting us for money through the window, but Michael had a chat with him within minutes.  Gabi K seems to be a regular here and I can see why....can't beat healthy, tasty food and fabulous service! Even if they run out of sweet potato fries from time to time...
4	kiOOkgaGRWrHrshIG1LUg	I thought the food was absolutely delicious and fresh. Our hibachi chef, Hoy, was fantastic! I ordered tofu and veggies (asparagus, broccoli, onion, snow peas), for me everything was prepared to perfection. We didn't get a show, but we had really good conversation throughout our lunch.  Our server was, in his words "still waking up" and not on top of his game at all, he forgot to put in my boyfriends extra fried rice and something for the guests we were seated with. When the server doesn't put in an order, the kitchen doesn't put it on the cart and when your chef gets to the grill, he doesn't have everything he needs and everything gets held up.   I left with a big happy belly which is not usually the case when I eat hibachi and everyone else in my party was just as pleased!  Fun fact: Benihana is no longer able to pop food in your mouth because someone (in Florida I believe) got a hot shrimp to the eye and sued the company.
2	wO4NPm1JO2OURxyQYa9iug	Have been to this restaurant many times before, so when a freind recommended meeting here for breakfast today . . . I said great.  Not really sure what has happened . . . but this place has really gone down hill.  Service was a little slow . . . definitely could use more than three servers with a almost full restaurant.  Food took a little longer than I remembered . . . and when it arrived . . . it was missing a pancake . . . which my server told me would be coming, since they only made two and not three.  This was probably the only really good thing about the meal . . . becasue by the time the missing pancake arrive . . . I had finished the other, and it was nice to have a hot one.  Definitely not my first choice . . . but would return . . . if not in a hurry . . .
4	7HOKnyfl5DS7lTOlg4TYQ	Oh heck yes.  I really like Postino.  The atmosphere is laid back (the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts) the wines are good and the food is really good.  I do wish the wine list was more extensive though, especially for a wine bar.  The service is really friendly and attentive, although my husband didn't really go for the wine our server suggested to him.   The bruschetta is fantastic and the cheese plate is ginormous.  Its good to try to get there a little early (think 4pm or earlier) because it does filly up and the parking lot is tiny.  (Or you can fork over the $3 for valet)   Seriously though, I think it must be the tiniest parking lot in Arizona, its like something you'd find in Boston!\\  Update:  I chose to have my birthday dinner at Postino because I wanted something casual and fun.  Postino fits the bill.  I called and made a reservation for 12 which was no problem.  (They did take my credit card information which I am totally used to doing for large groups)  We arrived and were seated promptly with great service throughout the night.  I was told when I made the reservation that if I wanted to bring in cake there would be a cutting charge but I could bring in something from Tammie Coe with no extra charge.  I purchased cupcakes and completely forgot about them until we were at Merc Bar later that night!  I called Postino and they were nice enough to hold them for me (again- they had held them from when Tammie Coe closed that afternoon until our reservation)  and I was able to get them the next day.  Cupcakes for breakfast!  I've eaten here several times now and I'm never dissapointed....not in the bruschetta or the salads.  One day I'll try a sandwich I'm sure....if only the bruschetta wasn't so yummy!
2	Gh9XtgB7L26hrVsTMYBaBw	Took forever. Went through the drive through and ended up turning off my car after waiting for 7 minutes for one person ahead of me to get their food. Then waited another 9 minutes to get mine....horrible service. Ok food.
4	UR9tRcKUddNTziHym4Lrhw	If Dairyland was in Williamsburg, Silverlake or Logan Square, it would get five stars hands down.  This is a sincere old folks place on the East Side of Madison.  I thought the service was perfect.  My club sandwich seemed like it came from the Park Hyatt in Tokyo.  I had no complaints.
2	aJFNutxcwSUiT50SdPtKfw	A new trend is emerging, poor ordering. We arrived and asked for the fresh fish menu, to our surprise they did not have one as they were out of most of their fish.  The Blame for this lays solely on a poor manager not ordering correctly. We should have just gotten up and left, be we stayed due to time issues.  I had the wood fire grilled salmon. It was over done, and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor, defiantly not a wild sakeye.
4	y9NAnJUdF7nyVbje4RNsw	We have been to Joe's several times and have never been disappointed.  The food is very good ~ the steamer pots offer lots of good food, cooked perfectly healthly.  Each time we have had very nice, friendly and efficient waitresses.  We like Joe's ~ it's a little pricey ~ but the portions are huge.  Blessings : ) KC
4	TeFXIkJQdrTXCpqb8ijCg	Who doesn't love a little Arbys. Their window is probably one of the slowest around... but who cares. Are you really needing your food in 3 seconds?  Nah...  PS - I dream about the loaded potato bites!
4	bipJJA3UDX0xOqxLHqraCw	I went to dinner with my family and we got seated right away. The server was very nice and checked on us a lot. The salsa bar was amazing, the salsa range from mild to super spicy. There was also a nice bean dip.   We had to cadillac margarita and a mojito. The margarita came with a shaker that you could take home. The entries were delicious.
4	PzD2osu3cuwhfP3DlouBxw	We dine here often, and are NEVER disappointed in the food. Their breakfasts are hands down the best of any neighboring typical breakfast place.  Their burgers are fresh, juicy & made to order, fries, onion rings, always generous portions. The servers are all very good, fast, attentive and friendly.  Over the years we've eaten probably most items on the menu, we've never walked out hungry or dissatisfied.  Would HIGHLY recommend this place.
4	NE8RizhPoUwOickgyAOFA	My friends & I affectionately refer to this place as Mexican Disneyland (I think I stole that from an article on this place or something). Where else can you find bacon dogs, carne asada sold by the pound, bulk cheeses & yogurt, fresh tortillas, 8 or so flavors of agua fresca and chicharrone the size of a "small person" under one roof -- besides maybe, Mexico?   My favorite is the shrimp taco sold in the back of the market at the pescaderia (even though it takes them forever to make) and a large cup of watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberry or horchata agua fresca. It's the perfect meal before a Suns or Diamondbacks game and a hell of a lot cheaper too!   The produce also seems to be alot cheaper than what I normally see at Fry's & Safeway. Too bad I'm never headed straight home or else I'd buy groceries there.    Andale! Andale! to Phoenix Ranch Market!!
2	hcp6wTrW050oE7SvbKe4Q	The Perkins here has never been known for being staffed with happy people.  I found that they continue the tradition with my recent visit for lunch. Now I was looking forward to seeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.   The new place helps but I'm not so sure I like the layout.  It is small and boxy.  I liked the old layout better.   But the place is brighter which is nice. The food was pretty good so no fault there.  But the service was subpar.   I felt like they could care less if I ate there or not.   We joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.   The manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to hear that in a sort of canned way while she was walking away.  Once again giving us the impression that she could care less. Now we saw our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.  So whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers.  We still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it. Bottom line is I won't be going back here for some time until the management and staff change over which I suspect it will in about 6 months.  See you then.
2	8KA71vn7kZheKLqKmhXBg	What in the heck happened to the portion sizes at IHOP? Back in the day, I used to walk out of this place with a full belly, ready to collapse on the couch. This time, I found myself picking off my son's plate! My husband's omelette was smaller than my son's that we ordered off the kids menu! Weird... just weird. I don't think we'll be coming back. I'll stick with the Good Egg.
2	bPmNdFXZZdbPcqX9DG8Gtw	I love Wendy's but will next time go to one of the other locations within the city when I get a craving for a frosty.  The staff is a little harsh, my order was not right and the fries were cold.  Text book failure.  I might have gotten them at the wrong time so will try again and hopefully they will redeem themselves.
2	mZH1KvbKKqbVThGMLxemkA	Food was blah service was great. The gnocchi with filet tips was fatty and tasted old the gnocchi was over cooked. Risotto balls were similar to something in the frozen food isle. The couple next to me sent everything back to the kitchen.
4	RNZaXM0FoAVPrSYXEqehFQ	I really enjoy this place, its connected to Surf City Bar & Grill, aside from that your greeted by a very friendly staff once seated your given complementary homemade chips with a roasted red pepper salsa (yum). The menu is simple but if your looking for simple this is a great Mexican Cuisine Casual eatery for North Las Vegas. They do have a children's menu and the staff is very patient even with the most obnoxious little ones (my lil guy). My favorite is the Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos with Chipotle Tatar Sauce Muy Bueno!   Recommend for a laid back atmosphere.
4	RsgPQsad0VnqwmzLQcn6pA	Bacaro is very "hit or miss" -- there have been times I have loved my food, and other times where the food has been average (but has been expensive!).  Overall, it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service.  However, there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others.  I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don't like.
2	tJwkTI7sll2O5SzhK7Bfhw	I live down the road and have tried this place a few times. I generally don't like to write up bad reviews about any business. However, this place has gone down hill fast.   My In-La6sw visit every winter. Yeah, snow birds from up north. We like to find inexpensive places to eat. We occasionally visit Queen Creek Cafe and each time we come here it annoys me even more. The place needs to be redone. I can understand wanting to keep the old town feeling but this is 2013 and given the caliber of other dine in places they need a wake up call.  The menu has does not change. Except for maybe a few special items that come and go with the seasons.   The food is OK but a bit over priced. You pay $10 dollars for a hamburger that is average at best.   I will stay away from this place for a while. Hopefully they will wake up and make some major changes.
2	nMfSBhzY8yHaqFPY3I7VA	I really hate that I couldn't have been able to come on here and just rave about our meal at Bob Evans but it would have been true. We had breakfast and the food was cold and the gravy and grits tasted like the chlorine water that they were made with. You could also taste it in the dry biscuits that we were served. The best thing about the whole experience was the hot coffee and the nice waitress that kept our cups filled and offered to-go cups. That was worth the two stars.
4	ih9FrrDQweZcR0lyGBkow	I like Fatburger. Their ingredients are of a higher quality than most quick service burger joints, they have Coke Zero on tap at their all you can drink soda fountain, they are open 24 hours and I like my meat well done. It's a win-win situation for me. This location is inside the Sunset Station casino, making it a great place for a late night snack or a quick dinner before catching a movie. The prices are higher than other spots (it's in a casino with a captive audience, people!) but I think the value is still there. What other burger places do you know that have Grey Poupon mustard, swiss cheese, chili, fried egg and relish as toppings? You'll pay extra for the premium add-ons but it's worth it (bonus tip: order a side BOWL of chili for a few extra bucks; you'll get 10 times the amount you'd get if you just order a scoop on top of your burger). Plenty of seating and always open.
4	HCLAT2LcpwtAUqhZTJaO3w	This place is pretty good for being an Italian joint, and I say that because I think that Italian is one of those genres that is best homemade. I tend to think, "I can make better," or "Prego is better than this."  Got the seafood ravioli, which was really good. The pasta with vodka sauce was soupy, but our friend said it was good. Meatballs and Chicken Parmesan dishes looked good. All of the portions are large.   I don't often comment on service, but I wouldn't go here if you're going for a romantic ambiance. Our server was gruff and he said it best when he admitted he came from TGIFriday's. "Are we doing separate checks? If so, I need to know now or I can't do it." He had an I-don't-give-a-crap attitude, which I'm okay with, but I wouldn't want you to go here, get him, and feel like you're in a sports bar.
4	cPSMXurrlX9VEoSiyukzaQ	This was more of a 3.5 start experience as far as taste goes, but I'll round up for good prices, quick service and aesthetics.  Seriously, check out the picture of my pizza. What a good looking margherita! I was surpised how scrumptious it looked coming from a tiny strip mall place.  Overall, the taste was good but didn't blow me away. My favorite parts were the delicious, high quality cheese and heavy dose of garlic. The sweet sauce and thicker crust reminded me of a stepped-up Domino's.
4	M5twxjIfO3ALYztm7msg	I ate there 2 times. I recommend sea food soup, spicy salty shrimp, Singapore rice noodle. The location is not that good. It's in Sun Prairie, a suburb area from Madison, WI. I believe if the location is in downtown Madison, it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison.
2	TqzPZmNIjTjJo4MBxTyA	Our server was great!  She even fixed our wobbly table, so this review does not apply to her.  We were there for brunch, so this also doesn't apply to dinner.  But the slices of pork fat were as far from "bacon" as anything I've ever seen in my 36 years walking this planet.  We were there on a Sunday at noon and it wasn't crowded at all.  However, a line quickly formed behind us and once they got behind, they never found their groove again.  For such an upscale appearance, they are completely unprepared for a brunch rush and the chef is still figuring out how to cook breakfast dishes.  Won't be going back in the near future, at least not for breakfast.
2	MJfqvBO91uV8acSTUlEWA	So I been going to USS Fish N Chips for 5 years and I have brought in many coworkers just because their bulgogi and short ribs was AMAZING. This Friday I have decided to no go back ever again. I got my usual order of bulgogi and my meat tasted funny it didn't look the same and it was PINK! I even asked my coworker was hers good  and she said no and agreed that she also thinks my meat was pink. I tell the couple and they recooked my meat. Between then I saw them heating up a customers food in a microwave before my food was returned to me. It was still gross so I waited until no customers around to ask for a refund. I got a refund but was met with an attitude and them proceeding to talk about me while I was still there. I can't believe they would act like that when I was a loyal customer and brought new customers to them. I'm so disappointed in this place.
4	m9HPMXePVXKMmReAakiPQ	Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!
4	Qb9IA3NoBSWmsJGmAVDQA	I am going to stop here everytime I drive by it now.  We went for dinner but didn't eat much- I just got a side salad because the real reason we came is for the pie!!    I overheard our waitress telling another table they were almost out of pie.  This was before we even got our dinners.  I called her over and she confirmed.  They had one piece of chocolate cream, one piece of lemon meringue and one piece of banana cream.  I ordered all three pieces.  OH.  MY.  GOSH.  It was the best pie I ever tasted in my life.  I was with my husband and our three kids.  None of us could decide which piece was the best.  They were all that darn good.    YUMMY!!
2	s08jURvcWn9Aeml9hSogg	This is the place to be if your are one of the two following types of people.  1. You are in college because your ability to run with, chase, kick, or throw ball shaped objects. 2. You are looking to sleep with someone who is in college because of their ability to run with, chase, kick, or throw ball shaped objects.  I was never a fan of this bar, because I was not a college athlete, and thus the women at this bar were not having anything to do with me.  Where is the bar for girls that are Rocket Scientist chasers ?   Haiku!  Look! Its number 8 ! Wearing sweat pants to the bar ? Jocks gets the chicks here.  Talent Level ? Impressive most nights. I had an in with some volleyball girls and spent some time here as a jersey chaser myself, and I must say this bar has some hotties. If you are a little guy, you best say you are the kicker.
4	ZNaNLRP0ifmW16ya6zaCcA	My preferred place to eat Chinese on campus.  Although, I will admit that I haven't eaten at every place around town, there aren't too many great Chinese restaurants around here (this does not include buffets).  Their General Tso's chicken is amazing.  Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side, but not too bad considering how much you get.  Anything bigger than a small and you're guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy (are the trays seriously called doggie bags, too?) unless you're sharing it with someone else.  I usually only order the General Tso's or Vegetable Lo Mein (my default Chinese food preferences), so I can't really say much about the rest of the menu, but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl, with a decent amount of noodles.  It tasted okay, but not great.  It can get kind of crowded in there with limited seating and the atmosphere isn't too great, but it's acceptable.
4	eku7Dzr94YIqiryhuv0yA	The first time I went to OT's was a Friday night with a small group that frequented this place and thought I'd like it.  Parking is always a concern and I appreciated that there was ample space in a well-lit structure nearby.  There was no cover that night and we end up posted at the bar, since there weren't any tables left, while the jazz band was still playing.  The bartenders definitely took care of us that night and we made sure to tip well.  The music was good and we were all enjoying the vibe and the opportunity to celebrate the wknd!    After the band wrapped up, it got really crowded and a DJ started playing a lot of bangin' hip hop.  They even took it old school during last call with Blackstreet's "Before I let you go".  We had a great time dancing and met a lot of cool people.  Generally, the crowd is pretty laid back and chill.  I'd definitely make the long trek again.
4	NNEFIqGXAKHU1hF1RKEreQ	Yum!  Cute little restaurant with yummy food.  Waitress doesn't really speak English but that was so unimportant.  The service was good and the food was really good.  Great free chips and salsa.  My kids liked the cheese enchilada so much that I didn't even get a bite!  Great bean and cheese burrito.  The best chili relleno I have had in a long time.  The price was a tiny bit more than I was expecting but I will be back!
4	lIfWZTiD0QOdrWKia1rmHA	I like this place.  Just can't help it.    Let me break it on down for you...  Negatives: 1. Food is not "slap your mama" good. 2. With it's popularity, there can be quite a wait on some nights. 3. I can't really think of a 3, but I wanted to have at least 3 things here...  Positives: 1. Food is good, and everyone can find something they will like.  Nothing to experimental, too trendy or too expensive. 2. The decor.  They could serve McDonald's food and the decor would find a way to save them from one star hell.  The much-mentioned trolley car in the center is fun, but I love even more sitting in the library room (or so we call it).  Or at one of the big tables with the big velvet chairs.   3. Great for when you have a lot of people in your party, and/or when there are kids.  I'm kind of stumped when I see folks mention this as a bad thing.   4. Even when you are waiting, there are awesome chairs and sofas in multiple rooms where you can mingle.   5. Ms. Packman!  How it is no one has mentioned this?  We've had Ms. Packman competitions while waiting for a table several times.  6. The place is really huge.  Why is this good?  Because if you go at a non-peak time, while not typically a date kind of restaurant, if you ask to get put in a quiet spot, it can feel like you have the whole place to yourself.   7. Location.  How much family friendly fare is down here?  Another reason the place is always packed. 8. Spumoni or sherbet is included with your meal.  Heck yea.  Listen, this isn't the cool and chic place to be, but it's nice, kinda fun and pretty well liked by most people.  Very kid friendly.  And who knows, you just might like it too.
2	DsvhZoDVVjGaNixpYUw	I had dinner at Carpe Diem with a good friend on a recent Tuesday evening.  The company was excellent, but the dining experience wasn't something I am eager to repeat...    First, the atmosphere.  Others have commented on this already, but I really didn't care for the decor or the atmosphere.  The lighting doesn't really work - the restaurant is too bright - and the furniture and flooring just really aren't up to snuff for a restaurant that's going to charge these kinds of prices.  Truth be told, the place reminds me a lot of a funeral parlor... Yeah, I know.  For an appetizer we ordered a salad - priced over $9 - and we told them that we were going to share it.  They split the salad, served it on two plates, and charged us a $2.50 "split plate fee".  You're kidding, right?  The salad was good, but not even close to being worth the nearly $12 that they ended up charging us for it.  My friend ordered the Mediterranean sampler from the appetizer menu, and she enjoyed her food - and I am at least glad for that.  My entree, the scallops served with risotto, was fine but overpriced.  For $24 I received three scallops on a bed of risotto.  The risotto was undercooked.  The flavor was fine, but for $24 the risotto should be better than average - especially when there are only three scallops.    To me, this is quintessential "high end" Charlotte dining - decent food that is absurdly priced.  If they had charged $8 for our salads and $18 for my entree... it would have been a reasonable value.  For what Carpe Diem charged, though, I just found myself wishing that I had gone somewhere else.
4	fAcg7Jr4qlGKxzRO2B8rg	Someday I'll branch out and try some other dishes, but the Chicken Cesar Pita keeps me coming back!  Chicken is always hot, lettuce always fresh and well chilled - The perfect combination!  And at $4.95, you can't beat it!  I actually like the fact that it's served on a traditional pita (taco style), not a burrito pita like most other pita joints.
2	XsAjvQP2WUxwejZQBYGIqQ	This is was my first time at this location. Can't really complain about our food. We ordered spinach artichoke cheese dip with chips,  blue cheese beef burger for my husband, French onion soup for me, and kids meals for the boys - chicken fingers with fries. Our beverage was sweet ice tea, it was like drinking high fructose corn syrup...I almost vomited. Our waitress was very nice and only worked there couple of weeks. She switched out the teas with something else, but I asked her to cut mine with water. Well, when it arrived it tasted like chlorine ice sweet tea. Yuck! Seltzer water was not available. What's up with that? I was very surprised. I won't be coming back there again.
4	Hq5gYKxOxJ25v4fOhDzYA	I am updating my review of Carmines because it has re-opened under the original owner and I believe they are starting to redeem themselves. I went to have breakfast there a few days back and the place is completely redone inside. The tables have all new settings, new menus, cleaner, brighter, everything is just plain better. One major advancement, no more gross armpit smell from the corner of the booth. The food is great like typical Carmines food used to be! I heard Carmine booted the old owners,the franchisees and took his place back over. He has a little article about how he franchised his places and the new owners ran a few of them into the ground and it killed him to watch his restaurants turn to crap. I commend him for taking pride in his place and making it what it used to be. Now to the important stuff....  I have not been there for dinner yet as of this review only breakfast and lunch. You can't beat the breakfast. It's nothing spectacular but it's a $2.99 and you and a buddy can get out for under $12 bucks! It's really a good deal and it's not half bad. The service has gotten ten times better, I think Carmine got rid of all the old crappy servers and now has some family in there running the show so they are pretty much on top of things. I have not had a problem so far with the service at all. Lunch was good, I had some wings which were great. Done just right and not over cooked. Good job on transforming Carmine's Little Italy back into a cool local spot to get some good grub and watch a game.  I have not been into the bar area of yet but if it is anything like the restaurant  I am sure it's great. Once again good job Carmine, you have an old customer coming back.
4	TQ4yHhy2eX7D5J5LNdOYjw	On Bell Road in NW Phoenix/Glendale you will find several places to enjoy sushi.  This place is near the top when you consider quality, value, and overall experience out of all the choices you have to chose from.  Located in a completely renovated strip mall anchored by a Fry's, the place atctually looks nice from the outside and not rundown like so many other unfortunate strip malls littering the valley.  Says something for the area if they feel it is necessary to make it look new and fresh again.  The inside is nice and cozy, very inviting, with soothing music to help you enjoy your sushi/sashimi/or japanese food as you desire.  The quality is fresh and delightful with appropriate portion size as well.  They have great daily specials with bento box choices, sushi, or even teriyaki chicken.  This place is a very good choice for Japanese food for the area.  I haven't tried the teppanyaki with my many visits, but sometime I will.  Maybe an update will be due after such.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Fresh Wasabi to anyone.
2	miAUGiXMZx1lEtZoEC6Lw	This food is guilty pleasure food. You definitely don't want to come here if you're on a diet or are even wanting to maintain your weight. I'm disgusted in myself every time I come here, but the food combinations are crazy and one of a kind. It's a decent place to come for a huge breakfast or if you're still out at 4 in the morning and need some greasy sustenance.
4	A1g1FcFozjPyJWit4TPigA	I eat at this place maybe 2-3 a week! I am die hard wing fan and these are the best i have had ever!!! They are crispy, flavorful and warm all the time! Best part is they charge by the pound not per wing! So for a  great wing and a great price try wings express!!
2	MDINmumohU4gB7b0mCMSQ	This bar transport from Iowa City is all over the valley, but unlike the Iowa version I feel it has no redeeming qualities. Bad food and funny tasting tap brews. Girlfriend's fake ID got stolen there, man, having a girlfriend under the drinking age sucks, I'm glad that's over.
4	EblHAzHVmB1mUoTGZgXpVw	I am a fan, as far as the fast food industry goes. I am not usually a big fast food eater. But i was with a mom and 3 kids at the time. Tater tots, yummmm!! I am huge burger girl and will say they were pretty good. I like the convince of this place.  Pull up, order, swipe ur card and the bring the food to your car!  Watching and hoping they dont fall in their roller skates with the food! haha, I was so hungry!  I think I will be back next time in AZ :)
4	HOF6ReuX6oOceNoQqHpsQ	So far the best Chinese delivery we've had here in Madison. Their food is flavorful, fresh, and not super-greasy.   They also have an online menu to order from, which is amazing! It makes life simple, and I don't have to worry that I mispronounce something or said the wrong thing entirely.   The only complaint I had is that while our food was steamy hot, the crab rangoons weren't. They were actually a little on the cool side. But, it's delivery, so that's not all that surprising.
4	EIrMhLkvhjXS1i5hxVoQ	I like how they do things at Sam's. It's upstairs in the Biltmore Mall but they manage to be the most laid back of all the bar/restaurants in the area. They convincingly do mexican food in a southwestern style with all sorts of interesting twists and spins on dishes that I haven't seen before. The chicken enchiladas are dee-lish and the margaritas are some of the best I've had.   Service is touch and go when they're busy but for the most part I've always been content with their staff. It's a pretty good date spot and the prices are reasonable, especially considering the caliber of the food they serve.
2	1KSklNgpPfu9aQxZumr2iQ	I don't know why we have to suffer with a terrible Taco Bell so close to us. It seems silly that, when the Taco Bell craving comes on, we should drive past one to go to one better, yet I think I should start doing this now.  Though it's been through several changes in management in the two years we've lived in this area, this Taco Bell is almost always the same: lackluster, unenthusiastic employees and dirty surroundings. The tables are never, ever clean, and there is rarely someone at the front - the cooks have to call for someone to get to the register when someone comes in.  Last time we were there, there were no straws, the tables were dirty despite having been open only 5 minutes, and the drink machine was malfunctioning, spraying soda everywhere. Also, it made my tummy hurt.
2	0ViHHGxRj6nudv399wGA	The service was friendly and the food came quickly, so I have to be fair and give them praise for that.  Unfortunately we weren't very happy with how our food tasted.  Our Crab Rangoon, and Fried Rice were too salty.  Our Egg Rolls and Won Tons in our soup were bland.  The Thai Tofu dish was too dry, although the green beans and flavor of the sauce was good.  I don't think I'll return again.  I'll drive further down South to Flo's.
4	vMxgdzaa4F7yMCILuW6qQ	Thai Place has very light, extremely flavorful food and is my favorite Thai restaurant in 'Burgh (and probably anywhere). Most other Thai places in this city have extremely greasy food that I get sick from.   It is located across the street from Waterworks mall, in small and very quiet little building.   I have tried many things on the menu including their fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, dumplings, tofu curries, chicken curries, garlic chicken, pad thai, etc... everything is excellent and always comes out promptly. Many of their apps come with a sweet white plum dipping sauce which is my favorite thing in the universe. I would put it on everything if I could.   Definitely try a curry bowl or two, the pad thai, and any of their soups. I've had them all and would recommend any of them. Most dishes can have tofu substituted in, which is a plus for my veggie friends. They have fried ice cream for dessert, which is pretty awesome, but im usually too full to eat it. It is a tad on the expensive side, but for the quality and service, I am always willing to pay!
4	VT9fNokeVBlSCpBxLmPPA	This place is pretty good. It was my first time at a Morton's. This is comparable to Bob's Steak and Chophouse. Definitely up there. The double filet I had was cooked perfectly and humongous; dayum! The waitstaff and ambiance was nice.
2	ZAIPYam5fMyixjYWI0Yw	A self cook steak house, the meats are good. The idea of cooking your own meat is interesting, no one to blame if you overcook it.  The salad bar that comes with the steak is from hunger. The sea food meat alternative is less than great. Expect to pay about $80 to 100 for a dinner for two with wine. the atmosphere is drab, too dark to my taste with little or no character. this place begs the question why not stay home and cook the steak for a fraction of the cost?
4	jR23jkxhXtIfZNyQrzW39g	Now, don't think I haven't been anywhere. I have dined at elite restaurants as well as common places like this one. This location is very clean yet comes with a bit of a wait. The food is hot and fresh. The staff is very accommodating as well. They have not messed up my order.
4	KoD3pAor8McPK3itSCef3A	loved this place so much I had to see if there is one closer to home (there isn't in Mpls, but in Chicago....)  went there based on the previous review; we didn't realize that there's so much more than the initial salad bar -- we filled our plate there and then realized all the stuff behind the line.   All the food was good (we love salads, too) and had our fill and then some.  five soups and chili, baked potatoes (and sweet potatoes) -- great selection.  Although it is all you can eat, I wouldn't compare it to Old Country Buffet, maybe another place that has soup and salad -- maybe "on a diet plan" is right.  This is more of a 'lunch' place whereas OCB is a 'dinner' place (or 'supper' if you prefer). great meal for eight bucks, relaxed atmosphere (be sure to put the marker on your table to indicate you'll be back, or they'll take your plate and tray away :-) Recommended.
2	2h3KAKWIjnp9MkGT6Cj0A	First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately.  I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads.    I ordered a Caesar with chicken.  The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95.  While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost.  The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.  A shame because the dressing was pretty good.  My husband ordered the Antipasto per Due.  With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit.  But again, drenched in vinaigrette.  Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality.  At $14.95, this was a miss.  We also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed "sub rolls."  Better bread is a must.  While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.  If you see me carry a duffel bag inside, I brought my own baguette, too.
4	imns0d4s8vsCwr8iI1yg	I'm lucky enough to work only about a mile from this place... so any time I can't decide on what to eat, this is the instant fallback. I have never had one bad item from the menu, and I've eaten most of it.  One of my favorite things about their food, aside from the fact that it always comes out delicious, is that when you ask for something "extra spicy"... they can actually bring it! Not "melt your face off" spicy, mind you. But it's at least a nice tingle spicy. Most places can't even get that right!  Bottom line is, if you're looking for something quick, tasty and not too expensive, go here.
2	T2SZmisBY79vKcXubxd6kQ	I used to like Goldfinger's quite a bit. Within walking distance of my house, i'd go every couple of months with my MIL for late-night food and a bit of gambling. At 1am, the bar is pretty decent, and i've actually hit a jackpot or 2, a very nice addition. In fact,  I give them an extra star for the $800 I won there one night!  The food's been changed, and not in a positive way. This has been recent, say in the past 6 months. One of the best items they served was a steak and eggs graveyard special, and it was unique. It has a Mexican twist to it, the meat was marinated in a very delicious, unusual blend of spices. It made the meat very tender and delicious. Not anymore! It's a sub-standard, just salt and pepper steak of ill-repute. NOT GOOD. I used to love eating that steak!  Thry do have Blue Moon beer on tap, so that's worth something, I guess.
4	lNV6j2o3PEIbo9TLd1rmrw	Long Wongs. How do I Love your Chicken Wings. Well these are pretty near heaven. The price seals the deal. Really don't need to say much else. Oh their Cupcakes rock and the Cheese sticks too. They sell other things too but why? Not so keen on the $5 12" pizza though. Ugh.
4	5aTHBASMg5nkHCvfYzZ8Q	A couple blocks away from the UPMC Shadyside hospital, this was one of the better Wendy's experiences I have had.  Friendly staff working at a fast clip at the inside counter.   I got a spicy chicken medium combo with small chili and sweet tea. I also picked up the $1 frosty keychain tag of which 0.80 goes to the Salvation Army and gets me a free mini-frosty with subsequent visits.  They didn't try to upsell me or read me the rule book when I asked for extra hot chili sauce (my favorite hot sauce of any fast food chain) and crackers like the Wendy's at home.  Food was fresh and hot. Can't ask for more from a Wendy's.
2	RUTvEPDpSF61nraDMVRiuA	Extremely oily and heavy. This food will make you want to curl up on a ball and go to sleep though it is rather tastey. Just don't go on a first date and certainly avoid this place if you plan on doing anything except hitting the couch hard.
2	yZ1chIjZaDyrarfpUOq1YQ	Lame, the place is crammed and stinks. The drink was ok and the price was ok. Some "ratard" spilled my drink because he was oogeling over my wife while she danced on the bar. (can't blame him, and he did buy me another) doubt I would be back.
2	zMBSZE7FHAjQrQ3a78Aw	I lived in AZ for a year and this was my hang out.  It was great when it was a HOOKAH BAR and now they are trying to do this night club thing and I HATE IT!!! The food isn't anything special the service is OK.... Now it is only a 21 and up inside deal which it wasn't before and there is no hookah.... I don't like what it turned into the old La PIta was GREAT now i got nothing....
2	XgPxkWaxKUsfh2HN4Agh5A	I wanted to like it, I really did. The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it...   First off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly.   The BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato.   To give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think.   Over all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!
4	nNwXoetylrNlQiwjsDb8Q	So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transient-week adventure during the first week of July thru Southern Nevada and Arizona.   This place gets my vote! After an exhausting day of sun and alcohol running the tubes thru the Salt River, we came here for some R&R. I picked up the Rosemary Chicken which was huge on the portion size. Plus delicious. The service was quick and friendly. It was medium as far as the indoor traffic was concerned, but enough to where our waitress could have easily been distracted and not cared about us. I like it overall. Nice place to revisit next time I'm in the area.
2	z7jYIJbJ92EuMpplmrlw	Was so psyched for this place.  What a letdown.  It was okay, but no big shakes.  Personally, I think the group I went with is SO cheap that if you get a big pile of food--discounting quality or taste at all--then you would just loooooove this place....and they did.  Needless to say, I found a new group of buds to hang with.  I can do 'po all by mah self. Piles of food.  Not much taste is Abacus' specialty, so I ordered the something-balls which is a piece of water chestnut wrapped in bacon on long wooden skewers.  Got enough of them to be full.  Are they good...meh. If you like meh, you'll love this joint.  Plus, it looks like an old, filthy diner to me.
4	6QXt6I2QjvpQYvkwd0A	This was yummy! I got the chicken chopped salad per the girls recommendation. Also the lettuce chicken wraps and hot n sour soup. The salad was fresh and fabulous, with plenty of won tons and dressing. The chicken wraps were great, and I actually had enough lettuce! It always seems at restaurants there is a lettuce shortage so I was pleasantly surprised.  I wasnt too big on the hot n sour soup, it was kinda gross, but truthfully, I'm not real huge on PF changs hot n sour either. So no harm no foul. It is close to my house and I think I will definitely be back to try some of the yummy dishes.   Also, I walked in and ordered togo, it was so fast! :)
2	2aGafux7onydGoDgDfeQQ	Went there with 3 friends, place was dead from 8:30-11, no one really in there....the best thing was the $2 coronas and the $1 drinks tickets i got from a smoking hot cougar in a BMW by the downtown sheraton one night.
4	EJN0Cq67t8ZGa0JtQoAp3A	I really like Port of Subs sandwiches.  I usually get #6-vegetarian.  You have a choice of three cheeses, but I always get triple Provolone. The bread they bake tastes really good and doesn't flake when I eat, unlike another major sandwich chain.  It's not dry either and I don't feel like I need to wash the particles down with a drink.   Port of Subs is right down the street from where I work, which is perfect because they are quick and always have a smile.  Employees are always helpful and help me out when I make a lunch run for the office.  I always ask if I can hand them the post-its of orders and not once have they rolled their eyes.  They take them all, stick them on the counter and begin making the sandwiches.  When they're done, they will mark the wrapper with an initial or something for easy identifying.   I just love coming here. Sandwiches are made tasty by friendly employees.  Plus, coupons arrive in the mail frequently and I can use my student ID at this location to get a small combo for $5.49.  Not bad for a student on a budget!
2	bEhUl7iUkH7pjIyc8DXyDg	Ok so this was my first time going here. I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside. My total meal cost was about $11 for a two item combo with chow mein and six crab puffs.   Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken. The sauce was not very thick at all. The chicken came in huge chunks  Kung pao chicken - Wasn't very good at all. It had a lot of water chestnuts and what looked like very minced up meat. Was not spicy one bit.   Chow mein - Tasted like it has been cooking in a pan that has been used over and over and over again. Lots of carbon or charcoal type taste like if it came off a barbecue grill.   Crab puffs - These barely had any cream cheese or "crab" I couldn't believe how most of the times I would bite into one and there would be barely anything in it at all.   Overall I will definitely not be going back here again it was really sloppy really greasy and didn't come as expected. The only reason why I gave it a two star rating is because the guy on the phone was actually able to comprehend English when taking my order. Great and now my stomach started to hurt!
2	2pWmlTz0yBGtq6Gwrv7Czw	Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer, when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open. They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks. It's nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work.  The beer selection isn't that great and the upstairs bar is not full. Sometimes their drink "specials" are served in tiny plastic cups. The service can also be rather slow.  I am not a big fan of their food (pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked), although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people.
4	rRvS0QW4Nlwm5Gpa7SGSJA	I have never been to the restaurant, but order delivery every 1-2 weeks!  Like any restaurant, some days are better than others.  If ordering spicy, it may vary a bit from day to day.    However, the portions, service, and price can't be beat in the area, at least in delivery food.
2	xMqJBAaRQNan0LMC3VfXGA	My husband and I, along with another couple, visited the Golden Phoenix a few weeks ago; we shared the Mandarin Dinner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was awesome.  Food - not so good.  One thing we noticed - just about every item of food was fried!  Certain items are expected to be fried, such as the chicken wings & the egg rolls on the Pu Pu platter (btw - very bland!).  But the Beef on skewers?  Fried to the point of toughness that I couldn't even chew it.  Worst of all, they do not put knives out as part of the place setting, so you cannot even cut the tough meat they expect you to eat.  The one saving grace to the entire meal was the Mu Shu Pork, which was very tasty with the condiment of dark, rich plum sauce.  The entire dinner was quite plentiful, and we had a lot of food left over, but no one wanted to take it home.  Sad, as this restaurant has been around for 35 years; we probably will not be back.  Two stars for the great atmosphere & service.
4	xVdeGs0lSP2TWb3rtuSEuQ	I am in love...with Zoe's grilled feta sandwich. Everytime my co-workers and I go for lunch, I always tell myself I am going to try something else on the menu...and then I don't because I don't want to cheat on the grilled feta. My sandwich is always toasted perfectly and the tomato on the sandwich helps tone down the feta just a touch. The pasta salad is my favorite of the sides to get. I tried the potato salad once and was not wowed by it at all. For almost $9 which buys a drink, sandwich, side and chips, I always leave contently full.  As a warning, if you don't like feta cheese, this may not be the place for you. About 99% of the items on the menu contain it.
4	lHpwtEwa3Ih44swzgABQ	Excellent pizza; decent wines (esp. the Cecchi Chianti); great salads (Ceasar and Caprese are excellent).  Nice, friendly wait staff.  The dining room is nice, a bit bare and the bar is small but the pizza and salads keep us coming back.
4	OJnLvewpfrdDY3OVySxJ2g	Placed an order for Delivery and the lady who took my order was very quick, friendly and efficient. She knew the answers to any questions I had and repeated my order back to me to confirm.   Delivery only took about 20-25 mins and the food was still hot when we got it. It was packaged great, they even wrapped the container with the sweet sauce for egg rolls in a separate baggie to prevent it from spilling.  There was a TON of food! If I had known that it would be such big portions I would not have ordered so much. The food was great too. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best Chinese food I have had, but it was good. The Kung Pao Chicken had a good bite to it and the kids loved the Honey Chicken.   The only cons I could put down, not these are really cons, but it would have made the difference between the 4 stars I gave and the 5 would be that with the care that took with packaging, I would have expected they would put soy sauce and other condiments along with it. Also the Egg Rolls were not as good as I hoped they would be.  While we won't add Egg Rolls to our order next time, I will definitely order from here again!
4	kIilPfVIyBN720SaWJGSw	Some friends of mine have this thing called Fat Fridays!  It's the beginning of a debauched weekend when the diets, workouts, no drinking stops on a dime and are thrown out onto the curb!  So we went to Red Lobster for Fat Friday!  I haven't been to a Red Lobster in like years, so I was kinda tentative about eating here, but the company I knew would be fun so why not!  Yup, indeed, the company was fun.  As far as the food goes...the menu has changed a lot and for the better!  It still has signature Red Lobster fare like all the fried sea food you can think of, served with potatoes cooked in any way imaginable.  But they also had sensible dinners pared with nutritious sides!  I was amazed.  This made for a long time deciding what to get, but I was hungry and had the focus of a lioness on a hunt!  I dictated to the table that we have the lobster pizza for starters!  no one complained out loud but I feel the daggers come out of your eyes! hahaha  I ordered a special dinner called the Hawaiian Isles...four coconut shrimps, salmon with a pineapple teriyaki type sauce, comes with salad, rice, and fries!  Yeah...it's Fat Friday! I also had a Mango Mai Tai that was dangerously delicious! It was gone in a sec...almost got brain freeze.  Our server was the most gracious and attentive server I have had in a chain restaurant, she was wonderful!  My rec...try out Red Lobster again, the food has improved, just be prepared for the lackluster crowd.
2	gE58RJV6vEecvQ5dYZRHQ	Came to eat here before leaving for the airport for a quick meal.  $20 per person for a Sunday brunch.  The food was below average and my customized omelette looked pretty but didn't taste too great.  I did enjoy the rib roast as my favorite item.  Our server was attentive to refills as I asked him for apple juice, coffee, and a mimosa as well that time.  We gave him a huge tip.
2	02Xim5odA4SqzPycELtRQA	The buffet is very inexpensive and the lady who served me is friendly, but the food -- well, this is the only buffet I've been to where I didn't return for seconds, and had a hard time finishing what I did take from the serving trays. The  selections were limited, the appearance of the food lacked appeal, and unfortunately that was also reflected in the taste of the food.
4	cpifGc84et3BNrafXDWp6Q	Clean, fast & friendly - that is this Jersey Mike's. Will the sandwiches ruin you for all other sandwiches in your life? No. But when your tummy's a rumblin' and you need a quick sammie in the University area, this location will suit just fine.   The folks behind the counter crafting your sandwich and taking your payment are quite friendly. They also seem to really pay attention to regulars, and I really appreciate that. Yay for kind customer service.   As for my turkey sub, it was fresh and as a regular size, pretty substantial. Get it, sub-stantial?! Hardy har har. The booths and tables are super clean as were the restrooms. All in all, Jersey Mike's has got it going on...oh, and they have Garden Salsa Sun Chips. That's my bag of chips, y'all.
2	5WwxSafg39xzSy3VgreP8A	Good portion of food for the price.  However, their salad lacks substance and dressing blend.  Their meat is cooked well (a bit dry) but lack any kind of flavor.  It doesn't seem like they marinate their meat.  Even rice lack flavor.  I have had better...much better Greek food for that price.  Not going back.
2	lLvKIE1PuvK27UAC3an6nQ	The chicken is good...the service on the other hand not so much.  I've been here about three times since moving to Charlotte and I've had three different cashiers.  Okay every cashier gets my order wrong.  They repeat what you say about 10 times (not sure why they can't maintain the information and type it in as you're ordering...guess it's too much to ask for) then type it in wrong and it comes out wrong. For this I definitely recommend not going through the drive through.  You'll be home by the time you realized that this is not your order at all or you didn't' get what you paid for.  The place doesn't look that clean also (it's on the old side) and again....service (well...) It's not that their rude or anything like (some not all) just kinda...well how can I put it...dumb (sorry)
4	3HETXm182GHuRXlJeHqR5A	Einstein's always has great coupon deals.....and this past Saturday I had breakfast there for only 4 bucks. What did I have you ask? Well I had the Turkey Sausage (which is a huge plus for me ) and egg white bagel sandwich with cheddar cheese on an Asiago bagel. I also had a small coffee to go along with it.....and that includes free refills. This meal would have normally cost me close to 8 bucks and again I only paid 4 bucks...enough said. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
4	UQ2AXF8Li89JyzABPmLEA	I was a little surprised by the lackluster reviews for Alexanders on here. I've only been there once, but I was quite pleased with the experience.  From the second I entered the restaurant, I was greeted in a very friendly manner. Service to my table was also prompt and amicable.  There is quite a bit of variety on the menu, and the prices are reasonable. I had the Tortellini Verde and my friend had the Mafalda Madison (thankfully I was able to sample this a bit too). I thought both were flavorful and tasty. Granted, I'm not an Italian food connoisseur, but it was definitely comparable if not better than other Mom & Pop Italian places I've been to. It certainly blows Olive Garden out of the water, but perhaps that goes without saying.  I will definitely go back!
4	D7D1cJQVadVAvyKYCjNr8A	Been coming to Guido's since we moved to Scottsdale in 1997.  Back then there was much more family running the place.  The only 2 people I recognize now are the cook (always the same dude) and Guido.  Of all the reviews I read on Guido's (I didn't read them all, admittedly), I'm shocked more people didn't try the Broasted Chicken.  Not "fried" chicken, but a close cousin and absolutely terrific.  Juicy, crispy and darn good.  Comes with 3 huge Broasted potato wedges and cold slaw.  Let's talk about the cold slaw:  BEST in the state.  Has some kind of oniony taste that just knocks it out of the park.  Sounds strange, but sometimes I crave the cold slaw more than the chicken!   Wings are solid.  Pizza's OK (I'm from Brooklyn and a huge pizza snob, so nothing in AZ is going to work for me).  Hot Sandwiches are great.  Chicken Parm and Meatball sub are favorites of my teenage sons.  Great selection of beverages.  Interesting beer choices from the help-yourself-refridgerator in the front.  Prices are decent.  Service is spotty, but the kitchen is right in front of you and very open so if things aren't going well, you can walk right up to the cook and tell him.  Also, Guido is always there, so...  Only real disappointment are the frozen "Italian Ices" that sit in a freezer near the front of the place.  They are pre-packaged and frozen.  Tempting to look at, but a poor immitation of the real thing.   If you're headed to the Harkins Shea 14 movie heater or the Big League Dugout for your baseball gear stop in.  With the lack of good Italian places in AZ, this one's worth checking out.
2	n27lp83hZCpzSSIUUA	This is definitely a below average Wendy's although as other have mentioned, your options are limited in this area and this is probably your best bet.  I have experienced long delays here in the drive through (20+ minutes with 5 cars in frort of me to start.)  My order has ultimately been accurately filled though.  The food is normal Wendy's fare.  The interior is fine and can get busy at lunchtime.  It is not especially clean, but not egregiously dirty either. On the low end of normal. I have never felt unsafe here.
4	CzA5xuBoAFK1KFrCqN4bUg	For a French wine bistro this place is not too shabby.  The restaurant has a nice, parisian ambiance and the food is excellent.  After really good suggestions from our waitress, I ordered the sous-vied filet w/ fois gras, my fiance got the scallops risotto and we split the onion soup.  I was initially hesitant about sous-vied meat, and since I'm from New England, I don't really get my hopes up with seafood in the desert--but both hit the spot! My one negative is the sloooow, but excellent service.  Good thing we had bread to chow on.
4	c5KdtfJfqQdpcbxpASKhaQ	I am kind of surprised that everyone hates Pong Pong so far. I have a really hard time finding Chinese food that I like and Pong Pong is usually pretty good. The people there are always nice, and they usually remember my order as soon as I walk in even though I don't go there as much as I used to. My friends and I used to go every couple of weeks and they always found something they liked. It's a little dive restaurant but that's part of its charm. Plus, it's a lot of food for a little money.
2	qa8vJ6qg0IwLfISa3ZQnRA	I've been to this Fuel Pizza before and would have given it an extra star, but this time around, have to give it a 2.  Reason being, my slice of pepporoni was floating in grease.  Now on the other hand my slice of just cheese was fine, so I guess if you don't add any kind of meat on the pizza, you'll probably be alright.  But, you can't judge a pizza parlor by just it's pizza, can you? The garlic knots were warm and fresh, with just enough garlic, served with a wonderful, tomatoey, garlic, oregano and basil laced dipping sauce.  It was so good, I dipped my puffy pizza crust end in it just to have something to sop it up with. My friend ordered a side salad with her slice and the caesar dressing.  I took a swipe off of her dressing lid, and mmmmm, it was very good...didn't know if it was homemade, or a really great bottled dressing you pay an arm and a leg for at Harris Teeter. Since this particular Fuel is housed in was once a filling station, there's lots of old auto memorabilia as well as .....well...memorabilia of all sorts.  There's also lots of customer decorated paper plates on the wall and some of them are really creative and artistic.....must be lots of NODA customers going there! And, the prices are good and the staff were very nice and quick!  It may have been an off day for them, and I expected better, but if I were that way again, I would probably order a pie to go, sans the pepperoni.  Anyone know how much grease a green pepper would put out?
2	MK5flE7gN7pViSI5dIeQ	Went there the other day and found the cheesesteak to be so-so. The bread was way too dense and the quality of meat and cheese was good, but there was just not enough of it. They also have Utz potato chips and Tasty Kakes, so if you're a transplanted east coaster, you can get your fix. Also, there is no indoor seating, so it's not really good for lunch on hot days.
2	0EbY3XLpCCpQoWvrLaYrbg	Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.  I will start with the good. Service is pretty good.  The place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross.   The floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.  Now for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams "this fish is not fresh". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.  Overall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.
4	srUIo9YIVYC4jnmAg6Rpg	Good, cheap Americanized Chinese food. The Sesame Chicken is bomb and the crab won tons are dericious!  I had my food delivered and I was shocked how fast it arrived, less than 30 minutes!  I'd recommend this place fo' sho'!
2	DrzihTJDSMUdtJodjZ8ng	Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.  The beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.  The best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting.
2	ZpNFkmgr0Z9UWT8DxlpcA	I get it, people get annoyed when someone says " I'm from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc" and why doesn't Charlotte have these things?   but generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you're from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)  But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...  My remembrance of a meatball sub:  Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.  What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs.   They also have "scrap" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.  This will probably be my one and only visit here considering we have about 7 subshops within 2 minutes of my office. Yay Jersey Mikes !
4	mb4owNjY0eL7tZCy7ZW6mg	Disclaimer: Vegetarian here.  Bamboo house is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix. Other people think so too, as it is normally very busy, although the place is big with ample seating, so there is generally no waiting.  The egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!  They also serve hot tea (Oolong?) to everyone, which is another big plus in our book.  The main courses are good, I enjoy the orange flavored tofu and some of their other veggie dishes as well. My girlfriend has tried some of the meat dishes and was happy with them. Dishes come served with either steamed or fried rice (which might be a dollar extra).  We really like this place and would recommend that you check it out.
4	e5xZSt4zGVXAaCieyRdA	More like 3.5 stars - wish Yelp would offer that option!  I would never have stopped at Sakana if a friend had not taken me there.  Located in a typical AZ strip mall, it looks unimpressive from the outside.  Inside, it is small, fairly uninteresting, but comfortable.  You can sit at the bar or at one of several tables.  Service was slow, but friendly.  We ordered the gyoza, which was delicious.  Often gyoza seems to be served cooler than I would prefer, but this was hot and well-flavored and delicious.  I had in mind Chicago-sized rolls, so we ordered 4 rolls for dinner.  Waaaay too much food - 2 rolls would have been fine.  The special rolls of the day are on a board by the sushi bar, and the server didn't tell us about them, so I am glad I asked.  The spicy tuna was nothing spectacular, but the spicy crunch California roll was delicious, as was the Tootsie roll and the specialty of the night.    Gyoza, 4 rolls, 2 large Japanese beers for a grand total of $48.  I was shocked - again, I am used to Chicago prices.  What a deal!!!  If I lived in AZ, I would definitely frequent this place, well-priced, casual, comfortable sushi.  Not flashy or trendy or a good place to "see and be seen", if that is your thing, better off in Old Town - this is just good sushi.
4	0NkSQUAMdh1OJJEKbDWQ4w	Black Angus is definitely not the first place that I think of when it comes to steakhouses however its not bad. I mostly find myself here when I have a coupon for their campfire feast for two (only $39) which is a great deal if you ask me. You get to choose an appetizer, I recommend the wagon wheel sampler, then each choose an entree, I've had the prime rib, new york strip, ribeye and haven't been disappointed once, and lets not forget their selection of great sides whether its a salad or the sweet potato fries they have a good variety for everyone. Then to top the meal off you get to choose a dessert, I am personally a sucker for their chocolate cake but the cheesecake is very good as well. Overall this is a good steakhouse to go to if you are on a budget its definitely a bang for your buck!.
2	ahgLaVW4u4d9boBFqZDHmw	Have been to Pooley's numerous times during trips to state basketball tournaments. The experience had always been good, but not today. Even though there were few patrons, waited 20 minutes for our beverages, and 45 minutes for our meal. The server was woefully untrained, and the bartender seemed to be annoyed when we asked for our drinks.  Food was just averge, price was ok. Service was poor.
2	rU5qEnSAQbltKrKxss7aAQ	It's decent... its better than streets of ny....  but if you want "true" new york pizza  hit up rays pizza ,  if you in chandler go to la famiglia on alma school and dobson.  They have authentic family style Italian food and pizza.
4	iGTOfTe1UrxbGuTIVrSs6Q	When the wife and I want wings, we go here. I don't typically worry about the Tuesday night special. I just go when we want them, and 99% of the time we do carryout. It's near the house, I get Honey Hot. She gets Parmesan, and we've never had a bad experience. If you like veggies, order extra (and be willing to pay) because they are skimpy on them. And yes service can be an issue here and I don't see the same people very often.
2	p7VErnZDWVTqh05GxJvrcQ	If it isn't past midnight, don't come to Antoon's. A $4.90 large cheese pizza is great at 3 AM after a night of fun but there are much better pizza options during the day. It's a small establishment and it's carry out and cash only.
2	CbWISJ3TAXFOWrbxNSScw	I always come here for the wings(carry out) and they always tell me 15 minutes.  You'd think that after the 5th time they made me wait, I'd have this figured out by now.  Wings are great but that is because I always get them fresh because I have to wait additional 10-15 minutes after the allotted wait time.  Just thought I'd let you guys know that if you are ordering carry out, leave your house at 15 minutes and it might be ready when you show up.
4	J8HzZ5dOf7qrQHCr5oAAGg	I remember my parents taking me to boston market when I was a kid in California. There's just something about their comfort food that sits right in my belly. Always a good experience at this location in Tempe. Foods good. Always satisfied.
2	9UiNJ5NdF52wpxam5LfAA	2 stars but only because I'm still reeling from my tequila sunset. I've been here twice now & have yet to have a satisfactory review. The first time, I ordered the pork nachos & found myself munching on bones. Disgusting. Rather than take them off our bill, they gave us drink coupons for a future visit. Umm. I wasn't impressed the first time, an now you want me to come back? By the way, the margaritas were weak.  So I ended up coming back over a year later for a work brunch thing. The service was mediocre at best, granted we had a fairly large party - but with a reservation - so they could have been prepared. Hubbo ordered a breakfast margarita & it was horrible so he traded it in for a tap beer. I ordered smoked enchiladas. It was about 80% beans & 20% two of the smallest enchiladas I've ever had. Again, to make up for service, waitress brought by  EXPIRED drink coupons. Way to win me over El Dorado...
4	BG6F0lfSo8Eno28qeaSMtQ	This place is solid.  Great carne asada, but stay away from the burritos.  This place leans towards the authentic, and burritos aren't actually all that authentic.  A torta or tacos will do you much, much better - especially the tortas, which aren't stacked ridiculously high with cheap meat like most of the tortas in town.
2	NXaNeglXwB7gwhHy3H2ePg	So I don't frequent fast food restaurants often, and it's usually because of the experience I just had.  A friend and I went through the drive through (it was just before 9:00pm). I tried to order chicken tenders and was told that they don't have anymore for this time of night. I know in fast food terms, that just means the employees have gotten lazy and stopped making them. Not even an apology. I was stuck ordering something I didn't even really want.  I ordered the nachos. Although there was a car in front of us, I do feel like waiting 15 minutes for our order was just far too long for a "fast food" restaurant. It's clear to me that this particular Hardees is just mismanaged and should probably be evaluated.  Also - just as a side note as to the attitude of the employees - lights were flickering on and off and so when I looked inside, one of the employees gave me a very discomforting look.
4	eKgzpZGRMGVHVD1FdB18jw	My family was on the west side of town yesterday and since we don't know that area quite as well we wanted to try a restaurant that had a track record, as we didn't want to take a chance on a local-owned shop.  I certainly wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is clean, as were the restrooms, and I loved the island theme - it give the place a coastal feel, which is nice if you live in Arizona!  I had some kind  of combo burrito that was good sized and gulped down every bite. I was in the restroom when my wife ordered for me, so couldn't comment on the friendliness of the staff.
4	QLOGLPvOoWcw2qmEUfrTwQ	There are two ways to rock the Szechwan Palace:  1.  The small menu and a fork, 2.  The larger menu and some chopsticks.  You will likely be profiled upon entry and, unless you're Chinese, get a fork.  On my first venture to the SP, I didn't let my lack of chop slow me down.  Since the specials were off limit to us because they were "in Chinese" I ordered the water boiled fish.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sauce miraculously changes the way other foods (including water) taste and should be experimented with at length.  It isn't so much spicy as it is transcendental.  On my second venture, a friend snagged us some respect by grabbing the Chinese menu.  We liked the squid with pickle, missed out on the water boiled eel but settled for more of the fish, and really loved the baby bok choy with mushrooms.  It is best to end a meal here with some of the fine corn jelly candies at the Ranch Market next door.
2	egck2jOVpjlOLlo5BOIJQ	We went in a group of 6 for their Saturday lunch buffet. The vegetarian dishes were pretty good- saag paneer, paneer matar, daal, rice, etc. The non veg weren't that good except for the chicken tikka. Idlis tasted like they were microwaved from having prepared them a few days ago. Sambar wasn't too bad. The Gulab jamoon was OK, hard to cut with a spoon.  Overall, it was OK considering it is one of the very few Indian food options on the strip
2	GR6PB7jJL1uf8TSgfQViRQ	Recommended by a co-worker, and out looking for some grub I decided it was worth a shot.  Definitely a dive as described, but reasonably full so I stayed.  The service was a little slow, and the food kind of blah, but the cheese wineburger was decent if bland.  The chili cheese fries came out on a huge plate and the fries were not great, the chili tasted like it came from a can, but the cheese and onions were real and fresh.  I didn't realize it was RC Cola, which I did not enjoy, but the price was good and it was an interesting place to sit and people watch.  /overheard "I don't do anything downstairs!"
4	YM5qqVi6NoVxulUFU4zlQ	I can't attest to much on their menu but HOLY BATMAN! the salads here are a must! The Niki Salad is covered in grilled chicken and is much more than just one meal. The chicken is seasoned very well and this is what makes the salad. The veggies on the salad are always fresh.  And on a recent visit, tried the shrimp salad and this was just as good. Covered in fried shrimp goodness. What would really knock my socks off is if they offered a grilled shrimp salad.   Call in your orders ahead of time because they can get very, very business. Service is always good and they are very friendly here.
2	oOQesvxJ3jTRtz4lzBQ6A	I thought should i even review this place? but the loving public needs to know I hit the drive thru window after a long day at work(are'nt they all) I ordered the 8 pc w/ the usuall sides in this case mash potatos w /gravy mmmmmmm gravy /coleslaw when i got home  I opened  the bucket ,at the bottom of the bucket were 8 sad pieces of chicken the 2wings and 3legs looked like they were from a piegon based on there size 2 small breast  and 1 thigh .......and i guess i got the new grilled chicken not the original or xtra crispy not that i was asked .....it was'nt terrible but for 18bucks I think i could have gone to albertsons and got better looking chicken w all the sides for alot less.
2	sNpyvyODOiZmuMHXS9Geg	The only place open today before 11. The breakfast menu is very small.  Interior: Pretty shabby...  Service: Nothing spectacular  Food: the green scallion has too much pepper, covering the tastes of the scallions, the soybean milk is meh, the xiao long bao isnt soupy at all...  Overall: pretty close to AJ :/
2	NWLCRsbltffCmliiauRWYg	the food was standard and okay. the service was mediocre. but what i really want to talk about is the menu.  first, the entertainment book coupon is only good for about five dinner-menu items. there isn't even an alfredo option. so that was limiting and disappointing.  next, the regular menu also includes a catering menu, and there are far more enticing options on that menu. but they won't make any of them unless you are buying in large quantities. if someone could explain that logic to me, it would be helpful.  with so few choices available, i don't really see a reason to go back.

I bought some meat, cheese & spinach ravilois to heat up at home. Your instructed to bake them for 45 minutes at 350 deg F on a layer of pasta sauce; if you follow these instructions, then they will come out great.  I also picked up a bag of 12 perogies for $4 which are the best I have found at that price in Pittsburgh.  My favorite part is the deli counter where you can pick up both American and Italian specialty deli meats such as capicolla, prosciutto, and sopressata. The sopressata is housemade and fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're unsure about something as they'll most likely be able to point in the right direction.  I'll likely upgrade GI to four and a half stars when I am permitted to do so.
2	usSDe9hExsyt0M7kfj3qCg	I have been to Delmonicos for many business dinners and have always found the food, service, and management very solid. On a recent business dinner the food was terrible! We started with crab cakes that were bland. The steakhouse salad was the best thing I ate all night. I ordered the petite filet with a blue cheese crust with the garlic mash. The steak came out looking like a hamburger with cold blue cheese salad dressing pored over the top. The mash came out piped out in an ugly lasagna noodle looking design and were cold and dry. My dinner companion ordered the same thing and got a nice looking filet with a nice blue cheese crust but it had a long piece of shriveled Saran Wrap plastic stuck inside the blue cheese crust. It was restaurant week and maybe the kitchen was over whelmed, but the attention to detail and the trash they served me was unforgivable. I had the key lime pie for dessert which was also forgettable and I didn't enjoy it enough to even finish it. I won't be back for any business meetings or otherwise until they revamp their kitchen staff and management.  Time for a total overhaul Delmonicos.

Read reviews of this place and it was really up and down, so I needed to see for myself.   First thing, awesome prices! It's very reasonable, $2.75 by the slice for pepperoni. I brought a drink, so my lunch was cheap, even if I wanted 2 slices, it would have only been about 6 bucks. They have appetizers, pastas, entrees, hot and cold subs, calzones, deserts, and of course pizza! All low priced for this area. I normally spend 10-15 bucks on lunch. But not here!  The cute girl at the front said everything is good here and there is really not a specific popular item, so i ordered my pizza and it was on the table really hot and and ready to eat.   This was my first experience, and I will definitely come back and try the other various menu items.   I'm very satisfied with the service, food, and prices. I don't really think you can beat this place in the area it's in and at lunch time.
4	pO2HEz0vDDehwHic6sWng	Probably the best fast food Mexican place in town the Carne Asada fries, super nachos and rolled tacos are the best. The salsas are bomb, good spicy the way they should be. Highly recommend it, prices are fair for the quantity of food received. I liked it way better than Nico's.
2	I8GzKyAhdssXyXPrLjBtLg	Mediocre. They gave us no spoons, took way too long to bring the viddles, I received a tiny cup of tartar sauce for my fish, and the prices were too high. Not so clean either, but I'm glad my boyfriend took me here, because now I know I don't want to go back :P
2	oKx6Y02nPUj5PXr4IzNUQ	I stumbled across this restaurant while looking for a dinner spot before taking a friend to Frankie's Tiki Bar.  If you've been to Frankie's before you know it's a good idea to have a filling meal before or you'll be leaving Frankie's with your underwear on your head but I digress...  I arrived before my friend and found the dining room to be attractive and clean.  The waitress quickly took my drink order and  brought it out with a bowl of miso soup.  She asked me if I wanted to order and I told her I was waiting for my friend who was running late.  It all went downhill from there.   My friend arrived and we had to wait 10 minutes for the waitress to take her drink order and another 10 for her to bring out her water.  She did not bring her out a bowl of miso so I felt uncomfortable eating mine in front of her.  We had to flag her down to ask if there AYCE available.  No where on the menu did it say how much it was and I ended up having to go on their website to find out how much it was (thank you iphone!).  This was while the waitress was having a long conversation with some other customers.  We decided against the AYCE and were finally able to get the waitress's attention long enough to  order a Rainbow roll, a Spider Roll, and a Shrimp Lover's special.    I was relieved that the fish was fresh, the rolls were large, and everything was delicious.  However, we had to ask the waitress for wasabi and I ended up having to swipe chopsticks from another table.  The food was delicious; it's too bad the service was so bad.  I don't think I'll be back unless I'm pre-gaming and need some rice to soak up delicious rum drinks.
2	Oo70E9zpX2CYsKL6BoBcdg	Three star food with two star prices - not to be confused with the two dollar sign symbols on yelp :p So yes, I mean it's extremely overpriced  Decent for an "special occasion" and students tend to be impressed with this place just because it's actually a nice sit-down restaurant and not on Green Street, but it needs to get over itself a little if it wants to thrive in Chambana. Fondue is really the only reason to check this place out since I don't know of anything else nearby that has this for dessert, but food is just average. Oh and their sangria is on point, too. But really, what college kid is drinking sangria? If they are, they are probably used to their wine out of a box
4	BDXi4P3CqchbMnTZIZ2Qg	Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!
2	GtSMQEBxUaWp4IC2hfPweA	My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1.
2	bire2mjcDyzZmkrK4IZgoQ	Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing.
4	C9C6AqoA7I3vqQtF82Zsmg	I have been ordering from this Domino's for about a year now and I am a huge fan.  I have never had any complaints with the exception of bacon missing from two of my specialty chickens.  I love ordering online, through my mobile app, and find both easy to browse.  The delivery drivers are all wonderful and respectful.
4	6sS9SLVzDr3mCTjGUxUSTA	An impromptu party sprung up in the Dance Studio last night at 10:30 and nothing was open for food, oh what to do? We called Papa John's on Via Linda and ordered two large pizzas. They were delivered very quickly and by a very nice guy - he even laughed at our jokes (always good for a tip). And two large pizzas for less than $24, who can beat that? One regular crust with tomato, pepperoni and olives and one thin crust with ?? (not mine so who cares, haha) were both very good.  We added a little wine, a little beer, music, and good friends and it was a party! I love Papa John's at home and now found a great place to order late night in Scottsdale too!
4	zzJmPQcKsRGXobMan4mwAA	Houston's is consistent.  The burger always tastes like the burger it was when I was in high school.  It is one of my favorites in town.  The french fries are the crispiest I have ever had, they are shoestring.  Not many people do shoestring anymore, probably b/c they'll clog all your arteries in one serving.  One thing I don't like about Houston's is that they do no accept reservations with 5 or more people-- that is lame.  We had to wait for a table for awhile but we sat out on the patio and enjoyed beverages, so that was nice.  It wasn't so hot yet that it didn't feel like torture. But it will be torture next weekend.   Another meal I always enjoy is the rotisserie chicken and the vegetable plate.  I wish I could prepare a vegetable plate like that at home b/c then maybe I would eat more veggies.   Service is always good.  The dark atmosphere is very relaxing as well.
2	rSvjixGWJW3sqAtoN1CUKg	Macayo's has gone down hill over the years, quality of food doesnt seam to be the same. Happy Hour is good along with the chips and salsa.   Howere this can be a good place to go with a large family.
2	uxkOr1Q9BH50vcJnG4CMlQ	I ate here on my birthday when we did a group trip to Vegas. We got in late, and didn't know where to go and ended up choosing this because the baby they use to advertise was everywhere in the hotel.  I've had a lot better tasting Chinese food and paid a lot less for it. The Moo Shu Pork was pretty good, but all of the other dishes we got were either too salty or too bland. They forgot about one of the dishes we ordered and didn't bring it until 20 minutes after the first plates arrived. We also had trouble getting refills on anything. This was by far the worst service I've ever gotten in Vegas  I will definitely not be eating here again on any of my trips to Vegas.
2	kjbeBxTOfkJAtwtifCLBQ	Rollerz is one of those restaurants that I know is a chain, but I've never seen another one except in Tempe. The idea behind it is to take  American-style sandwiches and serve them as tortilla wraps, cold or grilled. In addition, they have healthier alternatives to most fast-food places with soups, salads, and smoothies.  I don't know how truly healthy all these offerings are as the smoothies taste pretty thick to me, and my grilled Santa Fe Roller was covered in cheese. It wasn't bad, but as one might expect, the food here does taste manufactured as opposed to cooked. It's fairly bland, heavy on the cheese and sauce. Forgetting about the food, the smoothies may not be as healthy as Jamba Juice's, but they do taste good on a hot summer's day shopping on Mill.   This small location only has a few seats, but it never appears to be crowded. I guess that may be why I've come in a couple times to find no one behind the counter. After waiting a while, I would just leave.
4	d7vuGkn0oSqatHHEoK6j6g	Casual atmosphere, quality food, friendly staff, decently speedy service.  I first came here when I was in high school and it was great even then.  Now, it is a frequent work lunch spot.  It's slightly small and generally packed and lunch time, but waits are never horribly long.  Your typical menu of pastas, salads, subs, but the thing they're famous for is their monster calzones.  SERIOUSLY, you must come here and try one.  The crust is lovely, the fillings are always flavorful.  And they are just HUGE!  So do yourself a favor and bring your friends.  This isn't the place you'd take your significant other, because it's lacking in atmosphere.  But if your main objective is to chow down on calzone, you'll be satisfied.
4	VNHxKFZ74oukOsJ4n78A	Place rocks!  It IS a bit more $$ then ur usual Asian joint but its really good and portions are rather large. You do order your food yourself at the counter, get your number and find yourself a seat you like. I do not see anything wrong with that, do you? No longer then a few minutes they bring out your food to your table. And ... Yummm.. Yummm its good.  Good lil' joint.  "I like"  Eugene
2	qDdufhWT1eRPfrDzEzcgw	I have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit.  We went during the typical lunch hour of 12:00-1:00, and the place just did not have it together.  I ordered a salad, paid for it, and then was told they were out of lettuce.  I then switched to the pizza buffet.  There was one pizza out for the entire restaurant, and we were told it would be fifteen minutes before more were provided.  It just seems odd that a restaurant that caters primarily to people on their lunch breaks would be so unprepared for lunch.
4	uu9WOXATcGiSlCGOX56dOA	I like this restaurant because of the variety of food it has. Its a good all round Asian buffet not the best sushi. When compared to the other Asian places its not the best but its far from being the worst. Its doesn't look like a sweet shop, like some of the place around Charlotte. The service is pretty good also, and the people are always friendly.  Its the best bang for the buck.    p.s. From my experience the food is good quality. Nothing that will wow you, but will sooth your cravings for lunch or dinner.
4	XkkUIA9eJgRVucwLtxFB0w	This place is so good. Really big menu and everything I've had so far is really great! Their curry soup is basically my new addiction. Anywayss I digress... everything just tasted really fresh and everyone working was really nice. I'm defiantly a fan.
4	j7AVCreFzo4WG8YiprOxFg	Good experience. Nice staff even though our visit was really late. I thought it was weird the drive thru doesn't have a window but I guess that's the whole place. Hot fudge sundae looked and tasted good. This chain place lives up to its reputation. Fast, tasty, and clean.
4	DoNPDu296Qua2jEVqegA	Pretty good viet food for the price.  Usually get the bun (vermicelli) bowls, which are pretty good and have a decent amount.  The pho/mi are ok...wife order noodle bowl with duck and requested it prepared with no bone (wouldn't do it after a few request).  No biggie, but other places had no issue with it.  Her bowl was a bit bland, but the pho were good.  Egg/spring rolls were average.  Great affordable viet food, service is ok... Would avoid during special days (father's/mother's day, etc.)...takes forever.  Better to come any other time.
2	9Og62ASzVRZEswUArO1Eg	I ordered delivery and as soon as it came and I grabbed a slice of pizza I noticed an inch of dark hair in my pizza. I don't have dark hair. And when I called, I even said I don't care I'm still going to eat my pizza just not that slice, but I wanted to call to let them know, the lady responds with "that's funny no one in the kitchen has black hair, but I'll let them know" ok.. I don't either. The 2 stars if for the delivery driver only.
4	MLkbx1yqGdV7HADSwPpxWw	We visit this Subway on work lunch breaks for my fiancee.  It's fast and the food is always fresh and tastes good.  The workers greet you the minute you walk in the door and they always have a sufficient amount of staff to handle those crazy weekday lunch time crowds.    Both of us had the meatball subs, cookies and soda.  Everything was exactly the way you'd hope it would be for a Subway sub.  Cookies were freshly made and tasted as if they were baked in the last few minutes.    Great visit.  No doubt we will be back.
2	uQ1bg1rzoIuCcXXytJIUg	Their tacos are alright but their groceries are kind of expensive. I've never seen a can of Goya brand beans priced at $1.50. I mean it seems like a little thing, but they couldn't have been more than $.89 a can in San Francisco, where everything else is totally unaffordable.
4	mAVTKt5MNduefCJAexysQ	I typically don't review "chain" restaurant, but I want to say that the service was good (I forgot her name, we sat at a booth in the bar area) this Saturday and foods were good and of great value as well. GRANTED, the only complaint I have (and it seems to be quite common to all locations), is that everything looks and feels sticky. I wish someone can just scrub the heck out of the tables and floors and chairs.   We went to Chili's mainly because they have a Cheap Bites menu that's served all day on Sundays (and we sat at the bar area because I dont' know if this is only for bar patrons). They are also avaliable during the week as "happy hour" deal and "late night" after 9pm. $4.99 and you get pretty much a full size order. My favorite item on the $4.99 menu is Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The portion is insane, plenty to share. I asked for honey-lime dressing instead of ranch.  While I'm not a big chain diner, I do find Chili's to have good food for great price. $25 to feed 4 people is a good deal!
4	n4AmPM2lbd8W1nQedNXDA	i first started hitting up the Alley at age 15, when I was finally allowed to go to shows... ha, it was the height of ska (i mean the height of ska before it hit uber mainstream and 90210 rocked Reel Big Fish in their opening music montage), and came here alot that year.  it's definitely a rock n' roll bar, that does an amazing hip hop night. yeah, sounds all over the place, right? but this joint pulls it off. it's been a year since i came to Blunt Club, but it was hap-e-nin! it was so crowded and it was a cool crowd with a nice mix of styles and great music.  i came here recently for a friday night happy hour, and it was dark and empty, which was fine by me. it's basically made up of two big rooms, with a large stage looked on with six or eight large booths, LA club style. There are plenty of other tables, bar stools, too.   Ok, for such a rock n roll heavy decor i was MAJORLY disappointed in the juke box selection. it was one of those electronic ones, so i thought if they don't have what i want, i'll just download it...nope. either it was not capable, or i was not capable of figuring out how to do it. i wasn't drunk and i do it all the time at other bars, so i'm pretty sure it was the latter, not the former.   other than that, it was a nice break from the usual HH scene, we had cheap drinks (they have nice stuff on tap and cold microbrew bottles, sweet!) and cheap food. rock on... i mean, without the rockin' music part.  oh, and yeah, this is BARELY mesa... it's JUST over the 101, on the other side of south tempe, so i guess that counts, but not really.
2	1Z6muz9il57DGrjk7CSnsg	This  place continues to go downhill.   They constantly get food orders wrong,  they are out of items,  most of the employees seem to just not care.   I am done with this place.   I like McDonald's but avoid this particular one like the plague.     I have called at least three times and complained and nothing has changed.
4	YlzNOJvJm6rfNO5xgWW2LQ	useful tip...buy the cheapest ticket for a game and then come here for $35 and eat until you are satisfied...well worth it...and to think i was paying $30 for the All You Can Eat section with only Hot dogs, Chips, Peanuts, Popcorn, Soda & Water....i will be back to the ABC next season for sure
4	z9nwRfxcoqA1dSZqYEA3gw	Cute setting, good service.  Salad bar was ok.  The beef vegtable soup was delicious & I think homemade.  Philly Steak sandwich was tender and delicious.  The country fried steak was tender and the best I've ever had.  Conversely their prime rib is the worst anyone in our family has ever had.
2	cREX47EUUHgN6J3WdvVPAQ	Personally not my type of place but some of my co workers really like it. To me it is like some home made food and sandwiches that doesn't have that pop or flare that I look for. The menu doesn't impress me much either seeing as how I am pretty picky about my food.
2	ydRKCDuyxlCb2FXMHYFGGQ	Good pizza, lousy service!  I have been buying take out pizza from Pizza Heaven for some time now (even back  when  they were on 7th and about Highland).  So I  decided to dine in once.  What a  mistake.  We sat for over 30 minutes and no  service.  The place wasn't that  busy but apparently business  is so good they don't have to wait on customers.  If you want take out, then I recommend  it, but for dining in, forget it.  Hence the two star rating.
4	c4doKp7ghETLYmddzVk3ow	Really like the dry sauteed soy sauce bean sprout chow fun noodles.  I get take out here 2- 3 times a month -  have not eaten in.  The staff is friendly, helpful, food appears fresh and is ready to go in a heart beat.  It's rather lame they now charge extra for brown rice.  I go here mostly for the noodles, the tofu dishes I've had have been merely ok.  My partner enjoys the sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken.  If I could do 1/2 stars, I would give Hong Kong House 3 1/2 stars overall - for this review, 3 is too harsh - so 5 stars for the noodles and fast service and the convenience.
2	souScmv5XYyC4qF0vlYdg	I frankly don't get why people like this place....with exception of desert, - fruit, cake, dipped in chocolate - ok, I get it...its good and I would go back for that and that alone.  But for dinner...way overpriced, way overrated. Not family friendly at all. There are much better options out there in terms of value and quality.
4	imah709piAOcI65QinPx3g	The REAL sandwich king of Pittsburgh.  This may sound blasphemous, but I really don't understand the obsession with Primanti Bros.  The bread is too small for the sandwich, the meat tastes weird (especially their 'cheesesteak'), and I just don't feel the love for a heaping handful of french fries stuffed onto a sandwich.  The taste of potatoes shouldn't dominate one's sandwich.  Peppi's is the creator of The #7 (nicknamed The Roethlisburger in homage to Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger).  It is an extraordinary combination of hamburger meat and sausage (and they use some of the best tasting sausage available) with American cheese mixed in on the softest of rolls.  Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.    Located in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.    Yinz'll love it!
4	XNPzNN7FZyRBROJnHxIrA	Definitely an excellent sports bar. There are TVs everywhere you turn, and is an especially raucous place to watch a big game.   They do have live music intermittently on weekends, but it is much more a sports bar than live music venue.  My band performed there in May, during the NBA Finals. We were slated to go on at 10, after the first game but before the second game came on, which meant they would turn down the sound on the TVs. I thought we were going to get bum-rushed when some people learned what was going on.   It turned out okay in the end, but it was an interesting evening to say the least.  Food-wise, the pizza and wings are delicious! I had excessive quantities of both, as well as draft beer.  Apart from the sports crowd, it seems this place does quite a bit of late-night business, as a lot of people make it one of their last stops of the evening before heading home to sleep it off.  Overall, a good scene, and definitely worth a stop just for the pizza and wingies.
2	Ys9ipeSjnvMXey4DAtI0ew	It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.  For the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try.   We were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets.   Surprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station.   While we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food.   If you're desperate for Chinese, get it to go.
2	VNYD1SdWaECU61GcpzOecw	Okay, so this review is for Luma in Mt. Lebanon... Been there twice now and both times it has been 'just okay'. First time, had the beef tenderloin with pasta in alfredo (something I never get) and it was pretty good. The second time I wasn't sure what to get so I picked an easy one: filet. I ordered it medium, it came out well; the sides of the day were orzo with what seemed like sundried tomato but if was tough to discern the flavor because it had been prepared hours before. The vegetable was a zucchini and yellow squash sauteed in olive oil - undercooked and lacking salt or pepper (a simple dish yet someone was lazy and didn't bother to season it or let it sautee to a put where it was done). Needless to say, for the money I am not going back... Bistro 19 and Il Pizzaiolo are in the same area.
2	ARymkD2r1RHhGDvoZ6UMqA	Let me first say that I hate to give bad reviews to nice people. However in this case I must, if I am to tell the truth.   About a month ago my fianc\u00e9 and I stopped by Bell Italia simply because we love good pizza and this place had a great review on Yelp.   Let me tell you a little about myself, I am over a half century old and I'm a New York transplant (1993), I have tried some of the best pizza and Italian food in the United States and there have been times in my life were all I ate for weeks was pizza and Italian food. So I have eaten a lot of Pizza.   Yes I am Fat, but I'm working on losing it.   We were really looking forward to finding another place that we could go to and get some good pizza.   Sorry Bell Italia you didn't step up to the plate in several ways.   We each ordered a salad, now I understand that salads are in some cases are made beforehand and placed in the refrigerator. This is apparently what they do here at Bell Italia. The unfortunate part is that some of the lettuce in my salad was brown and wilted. Too much time between making the salad and service.   I hate when I pay for something that is wilted.   Now on the extreme cool and good tip, these folks cater to you like no others. They are friendly and very attentive and I would give them 5 stars in this category alone.   Now back to the bread and the pizza. While eating my slightly wilted salad I also tried some of the Italian bread that they give us. I noticed that there was something a little funky (not quite right) about the flavor of the bread. First, I like crusty Italian bread, this bread was soft. But again it was mostly the flavor that disappointed; I just can't put my finger on it. In any case they must make the dough in house and use the same dough for the pizza, because the pizza had the same off flavor. It was a big pizza (24in) so we took home what was left and I tried it the next day, same funky flavor.   Let me say this bothered me so much and I liked the reception these folks gave us so much that I literally went on the internet to find out how to make Italian bread. Furthermore, I visited several other pizza places in town and tasted their pizza again to compare the difference and there is something definitely off with the dough at Bell Italia.   I truly hope that the people at Bell Italia take the time to see what they can do to improve on the dough. They are great people and I want them to continue to succeed in the face of additional competition.   In conclusion, I WILL give them another chance however next time I will try their entrees, but please make sure my salad is not brown or wilted and my Italian bread tastes great and is crusty. I wouldn't suggest Bell Italia to anyone at this point. I will take the bullet for you. Look for my future review on the bread and entrees. I hope it's a good one.
2	gLQspLn3tDNUNTuNyWSa1Q	I work right next door to this place, I gotta tell yah my dislikes are the fact that they are tooooo pricey for filipino food.  lower your cost people.  I do love your halo-halo and chicharron bulaklak though.
4	jSwYTBHcCOZbfze5GpJpdw	I stopped in for a weekday lunch, and Eliana's was busy.  The server said, "I haven't seen you in a long time.  Do you want to see the menu, or do You already know what you want?"  I ordered my usual: dos pupusas con carne.  And flan, for dessert.  I am a sucker for a place that recognizes me.  I don't love everything on Eliana's menu, but I love these things.  The pupusas arrived at my table piping hot.  I use all of the cabbage salad on top of them, and about half of the sauce.  Yummy goodness!  I've tried a few other things on their menu:  fried yucca (interesting) beans and cream for dessert (not so much).  I'll stick with what I know and love.  Plus, Eliana's is right down the street from my office, and the prices can't be beat.  One caveat:  I ordered my lunch to go once, and the packaging left a lot to be desired.  The sauce came in a baggie.
2	bjqvcAgk4e8ugeAvFqUpQ	No no no. What place are you people eating? The reviews looked good but the food was the same bland slop I could get at any stripmall place in the country. Panda Express is better than this. I am not criticizing the owners just the reviewers!
2	P3bG8HRc47AQyq1NPhJbQ	First time to a Weinerschnitzel and it will probably be my last. The service was good and fast. Unfortunately, the food was less than mediocre. I got a corn dog and a chili dog. The corn dog was fine but the chili dog was awful. The chili tasted like old, canned chili. I don't eat drive through too often because I like to keep it pretty healthy. I don't have high expectations for drive either, but this was enough to keep me away for a long while.
2	cM1VYZkGACwjkqS9ZsCgJQ	Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, "Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah"  When he should have said, "Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard."  I'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.  I can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's.
2	EQZjeyvQRe0xnEYcVeK0A	2.5, just not enough to give it three.   Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm!   They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!
2	fzkyKXMdy6jnYn3XsdyEA	Despite the high reviews, I found almost nothing special here. The pizza slices tasted like cardboard. No flavor and dry and hard. I would not waste calories on this in the future.   The garlic knots, however, were actually good. Most garlic knots are little hard bricks of dough. These were soft and yeasty with a real garlic flavor.   Even though it's super convenient, I will not return. There are better pizza places I'm this area. Try DaVinci's off of Davis Lake and Harris instead.
4	0rZz03LlKUuqQhCPtHrvw	LoLo's chicken and waffles were my first choice but the 45 minute wait at 10:30am wasn't good for me so went here.  Place is huge and the waitstaff friendly and quick.  Food is greasy diner fair, which I loved.  They had a great dessert display case.  Breakfast for two, under $20.
2	fNqTwhGGOUN01YPx1gZzAQ	When I came here with my ex, I think there was a private event or something going on in the "other" room. We were standing in front to check-in for at least 5 min, watching some waiters not really doing anything but walking around "just because."   When we finally sat down, the waitress attending our table was very nice, so that's why I'm willing to throw 2 stars on this place. Otherwise, I don't understand what all the hype is about.  The appetizer squid and olive salad was quite good. I thought I can make better green salad, though. Both of our entrees were so terribly salty that I thought about sending them back to the kitchen, but instead, I just didn't bother finishing it and forced myself to wash down the portion that I ate with wine.   The dessert was nothing extraordinary. My pana cotta tasted good, but my ex's chocolate cake was as dry as a kitchen sponge.   I've been to some of the most acclaimed restaurants in the country, and I'm sorry to say that Harvest is far away from making into the list.
2	5GMrdFddtJkfOH3g0SB0jA	I walked in with my aunt, and noticed there were only about 5 tables of people and there was no one at the hostess station. After 5 minutes of looking at the hostess gossip with the waitress (who made eye contact with me several times) we were sat to a filthy table which i had to clean myself. The food was not edible, and the service was awful. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I normally would have left as soon as i saw how dirty the table was but at this point i was curious what the macaroni grill was all about and why they still exist. I have no idea !!!!!!
2	8l84z3CF8mQOXaJMOF6zg	Really nice staff, the service was great. But I don't know why this place gets such good review for the food. I wanted to like it, but it feel short. Everything I ordered ( 3 dishes ) had no real good flavor. Kinda a let down on this place. I probably won't be back. But I do want to note again, that the staff were awesome.
4	lK7KMqhjs9gBSPiiBd3rg	I tried this place and loved it! While the outside may not be fancy the customer service is warm and fuzzy. I tried the black bean and corn veggie burger that was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable soup as a side item is was good but a little to salty for my taste. The coffee is decent and the prices are reasonable. Support this local family owned diner you won't be disappointed!
4	pj8P3WZb2UbFh30hKAhQ	The employees at this location are sooo nice! Even when it's super busy they are still very friendly. My favorite thing about this place is it's open 24 hours! If you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it! My fiancee enjoys their french dip sandwich whereas I always try something different. I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food. Late at night this place is especially fun because of the people watching.
4	JTrq4oFG0tXxUHc4UjKNWA	Ordered delivery when staying at the Sheraton Station Square.   It wasn't super fast but wasn't unreasonable (45mins) and the pizza was so good that I ended up eating way more than I intended.  Not too greesey with a nice balance of cheese, sauce, dough, and toppings.
2	2QlfILudCtFnesJbyhr1w	The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.  As a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.
4	7A0LjhUmmNsYFvgd3rg	I always feel silly reviewing a huge chain, but my service here last week was so friendly and great I had to get my Yelp on!  They offer several manager's specials and of course half-priced drinks and other various specials depending on time of day.  I was picking up some grub for a buddy who had been helping me with man stuff at my house all day, and got him a humungous M&M Sonic Blast.  They also put up with my special request to add caramel sauce to said Blast.  ('Cause it wasn't unhealthy enough yet...?).  They also gave me ample ketchup for the two orders of tots I got.  There's nothing worse than getting home to realize there's just not enough.  There was a small young-ish family sitting outside and the awesome carhop, Elizabeth, brought out a handful of balloons for the kiddos.  Who can resist a balloon?!?  Warning: you cannot leave a tip on a credit card payment.  I HATE that...especially when there is no warning. I'm left feeling like a d-bag cheapskate, but luckily Elizabeth took it in stride as she didn't have enough change to break the only paper money I had on me.
4	V2n3N1DccbMdDIJREvipsg	I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!
4	c6Fq2tICKnHTlgiu7QPatA	I absoulutely love a good mexican meal, and I loved this place. I had the enchiladas and I was so impressed by the way it was presented to me! I was also VERY happy with the prices, and will definately go there again. The service was ok, but the food did it for me. I think I put on about 5 pounds, but don't even care... I'll go to the gym on friday.lol
2	tPHkIyJJx9pea1fQJE88rg	We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly, it tastes like Geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. The pepperoni was very good. The crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. I've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time I'm in the burg.
2	vHtrHTnoPau79tVeRmhOUw	Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.  Fast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.  Food-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.
4	O4czAsbZP74kYsnF1dzS9w	Ate pizza and played video games at Peter Piper Pizza with my lil bro Saturday afternoon as part of a larger pizza party, and we had a blast. No, the pizza ain't great, kind of tastes like a greasy sponge, but the kids don't notice - and really that's why you're there anyway. I say greasy sponge, but you know I had at least three or four slices. Even bad pizza is good pizza.  This location definitely felt a little cleaner than some of the others around the valley.  The game selection was decent, though still doesn't compare to an actual arcade - they had Star Wars Trilogy, Area 51, a boxing simulation, air hockey, at least three different sets of racing games that two people can play together, a bunch of the ones where you just drop your token in and that's it (aim for the back of the dump truck, aim for the railroad bridge, etc) - some of which are actually a little addicting. And Skee Ball, of course. God, I don't know what it is that makes Skee Ball so addictive - my lil bro and me, we must have dropped tokens into that game for over an hour. He walked away with hundreds of tickets, which he redeemed for cool stuff - a slinky, and some playing cards. Oh, and vampire teeth. Can't go to Peter Piper Pizza and leave without redeeming your tickets for vampire teeth.
4	CHjZv0YwWLCpV8E8ZT87g	I had several restaurants on my mind: Flo's, Elephant Bar and at the last minute decided to go to Macaroni Grill at around 6 PM. The parking lot was full, all the tables on the patio were occupied so I dropped my wife off to put our name in.  After parking, I walked into the restaurant and she wasn't there, they had all ready seated her. We sat in a couples booth and could watch the cooks and waiters picking up their orders.  We ordered the stuff mushrooms, but after a long wait our waitress came by and told us they had to start a new batch. She asked if we still wanted them, of course not. I'm glad she asked, 'cause we all ready had our fill of their delicious bread.  My wife ordered the house wine, 1/2 insalata , Margherita pizza and I had the Shrimp Portofino which looked small but very filling. Our waitress, Jess, was a little slow in bringing us a take home box and the check, but was friendly.
2	F0xvFLQZPSW8zAcoKRc2EQ	I have to echo the other two reviews for Delaney's. We had heard from some that this was a great place for steak so we tried it. I will say that our steaks were very well done, juicy and delicious. The atmosphere and service was stuffy and rather cold. Our baked potatoes and salads were simple, plain and dull.   The experience is not worth the price.
2	TaHKQFZsoSrzyyktbedqA	I would award the food three stars, but the service here was not impressive.  I came with a group of about forty people, and we dined in the banquet area upstairs. It's a very nice space, and you don't have to go through the rest of the restaurant area to access it. There are chandeliers, brick walls, and a bar. We ate a buffet-style meal that included salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, chicken marsala, and vegetable lasagna. There was also bread and dessert.  The bread really wasn't anything special. The salad had a lot of leafy greens and little else except a couple slices of cucumber and a couple tomatoes here and there. The greens weren't the freshest, but they were okay. The green beans were tender but not mushy and nicely seasoned (until the end, when the beans had been swimming in really salty water for a long time). The mashed potatoes were good, too; there were some chunks of potato which I liked. The chicken marsala was also good; the chicken was cooked nicely and I enjoyed the flavor. The lasagna was very thick and was layered with carrot, zucchini, and squash. Overall, it was too cheesy for me (especially with the layer of melted cheese on top), and I ended up just picking out the vegetables. The chocolate mousse dessert was incredibly rich. I haven't had mousse in a very long time so I don't have anything to compare to, but the small bowl they served us was way too much for me. It was, however, very light, and it included tiny slivers of chocolate, which I enjoyed.  As for the service, it was very rushed. We were there for an hour. Everything (except our drinks) was cleared within a half-hour. I would have had some more bread or maybe some more salad, but it was gone by the time I thought about it. As we left, it became apparent that they had another event after us, but the rushing had a negative effect on my experience.  Overall, I wouldn't mind having a meal there again, but only if there were no better options.
2	V2FrhtyvDRKEqmAzoFGg	I've been on a sesame bagel kick these days. I went into this location yesterday, very busy morning crowd. Waited to order, waited to pay, but expected that seeing how busy it was. There was one woman who needed help out with her order which took up five big paper bags. So even though my order was as simple as could be, which was one sesame bagel sliced, not even toasted, to go, I forgave the long wait and decided to try them again. Because their bagels are awesome.  I went there this morning. Yes, I wanted another one! Decided to see if the service was any better. It was later in the day, so when I walked in, there was only one customer at register to order, only one waiting for their food. I ordered two bagels this time (preparing for tomorrow's craving), only sliced to go. I was excited that a batch of them just came out of the oven, fresh and warm! There was four employees behind the counter, yet it just seem like they were moving, yet not being efficient. One of them acknowledged me, said they'd be right with me, then I waited about 5 minutes. Hmmmm. I paid, and my bagels were handed to me almost immediately.  As I was opening my bag of bagels when i returned home, I was thinking that experience was much better. However, as I looked down at my bagels, which did smell toasty and fresh, I saw that they must have manually sliced them, instead of using that automatic bagel-slicer thing-a-ma-jiggy that cuts it almost perfectly. Not sure if it was because it was fresh, but my bagels were flat as the wall. It could've been the bagel thins they were selling. Not cool...  I'm only giving it 2 stars because they taste so good. As flat as they had become. Not sure if it's just this location, but I'll definitely be trying a different one. If that...
4	zulyuOSMRclfwcgrJmtfyw	Came here on a Tuesday night recently and I was quite impressed.  The sushi was great and enjoyed the ambiance with the waterfall in the middle of the restaurant.  I'd give this place 5 stars only if they updated the place a little.    Overall I'd say check this place out and give it a shot.  Next time I will do the teppanyaki and see if that lets me overlook the outdated decor to push this place to 5 stars.
2	blr9IsgCoam9hE3Z7XeEg	Applebees is a good place to go the service is great and the drinks are good and great places especially happy hour they have these amazing Wong tan tacos but there wings and cheese sticks are horrible the marinara and cheese sticks are always cold and the wings suck they deffinately need to know how to make wings I make better ones at home that people would pay money for
4	i4nhCkwvCIDKIRbo3qtLQ	For fast food burritoes, I DEFINITELY choose Qdoba over Chipotle.  Eww Chipotle.  Gross Chipotle.  I won't even go for the free burrito day at Chipotle.  But anyway, back to Qdoba.  They have some good burritoes.. my sister loved any of the ones with their queso sauce, and I have to say I used to love their Chicken Mole burrito (not authentic, but still so good that it didn't matter), but I don't think they have them anymore?  I tried a bbq sauce one that seemed like it was close to that flavor, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't no mole, if you get my meaning.  Wink wink, nudge nudge.. yeah, I don't know why that requires a wink wink, nudge nudge.
2	VmAWymJxt3Rc4oL4pUjzJg	Like Ians, I just don't get this place. The service at times is surly and confusing.  The pizza is extremely cheap and quite good. They have a wide selection of after-bar fried foods.  Otherwise there isn't anything very exciting about Pizza Di Roma.
2	tcYQ9oKQ1Hx1EQNzdD1T8g	The food here is decent. However,  the service  is so bad that I wouldn't consider ever going here again. The owner who was running the register definitely didn't make anyone feel welcome. (Not even a "Hello"?) Well, that and the fact that we ordered coffee and from the time we arrived until we left (nearly 40 minutes), all six containers of coffee were empty. The place was still busy. Surprise folks support small businesses in spite of how bad the customer service might be.
4	ryxecXEoo90UMUHXi1QQTg	I have eaten at fatburger several times and found the burger tasty and a decent price.  The have 3 kinds of french fries, steak, thin and curly and now that I think about maybe regular!  They serve quick even though they are usualy crowded.  You can go from a third pound all the way to a 24 ounce burger, now thats a hamburger.  If you try it you will not be disappointed.  "The Truth"  Ciau!
4	GJXTYENL5LBsBDllIyPcQ	Good food.  The sopapillas are an excellent addiction, especially the cinnamon sugar ones, and are the reason for the four stars.  The mildest of the three levels of chili is mild enough even for pasty white boring me, yet still delicious and flavorful.  The hotest chilis satisfieds my coworkers with even the most burned-out of tastebuds.  Portions are plentiful and dinner under $10 is quite doable.
2	5u1Rg6kCzfkrOFojhcyKnw	This is not real mexican food.  Who serves beans with chips?  The beans were good but the concept was not understood.  Even in Mexico they don't give you a bowl of beans with chips for an appetizer.  It was free though so plus for that!  The salsa was decent as well and of all the food we ordered (5 people total), the carne asada was the best flavor with grill tasting all over it.  Cute how they give you a "serrano" chile with each meal.  Everything else was bland.  My fried ice cream was not crunchy and way too hard that we couldn't finish it because we couldn't wait for it to melt more.  A little over priced too.
2	WC93Wnnw2ZU485518HOww	The genius who built this place was apparently under the impression that 4-5 feet of clearance between the bar and the tables is more than enough to house the crowds in a downtown bar on a college campus. The Church Key's crowds resemble a Mumbai street market (except with frat boys instead of Indians) on any weekend night, and even on most Thursdays.   While I've never actually had a terrible experience here, I've never had a memorable one either. There really isn't anything that makes the Church Key stand out from any other campus bar, in terms of selection, prices, staff, features, decoration, or anything else a good bar excels at. Drinks are pretty overpriced. Given its extreme average-ness, The Church Key doesn't really offer any specials that would ever make me want to go out of my way to get a drink here any night of the week.
2	X5Bo5N15MKGcJQrTwTzLzg	This is for Espos the restaurant right next to Espinozas Market:  On the positive side - the food is very affordable and you get a lot.  I had high expectations after reading the other ratings but unfortunately my experience with the food was that it was pretty bland. The chicken on the chicken taco was so watery (perhaps from being boiled right before being put into the hard taco) that it took a good minute for it to stop leaking water out of the shell. The chips with Jalepenos were served with room temperature cheez wiz type sauce and canned jalepeno slices on top of hard chips. The chicken enchiladas were bland - lots of cheese on top but not very flavorful.  I wish I could give it a higher rating but based on the meal tonight I won't be going back any time soon unless a need an inexpensive meal quickly.
4	rpxwpPdr5jzCV8MUdaG1sw	I think my family likes the atmosphere here more than the food, but that's OK. Even though there are always plenty of singles and couples here, the relaxed, friendly atmosphere also works perfectly for families. Get a booth if you can and enjoy your own personal TV complete w/remote control! (If you can wrestle it from your partner, that is). Want more reasons to visit? T1 connection for laptops, outdoor seating, and pool tables and shuffleboards.
2	A05sD6Cp1anuZqjORHYFCQ	We tried The Lotus and found it to be, while a friendly and capable chinese food joint, simply derivative. The food was hot, served quickly, but lacking in character or flavor. The mongolian beef was served sweet in a thick sauce more reminiscent of something that you would find on a McRib sandwich.  My date's mushroom foo young was left unfinished, she found it generally unappealing; she said that the mushroom sauce had an odd flavor.  We prefer the Sam-Pan just down Water Street, if anything for the expended vegetarian menu choices and the friendlier atmosphere.
4	VPquzTzEl08IqQ6QEDSA	Pretty good Korean food.... IMO.  I lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food.  This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare.  Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.  Anyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.  Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them.  Two of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides.  Oh, and a good boba spot is right next door... kbbq then boba, ftw!
2	gM2Pdvw693hBxEuMzB2g	The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs.
2	FO5xBbJs4ZSrT4rOxMPAhA	This is one of our restaurants in PebbleCreek. I really love the building in which it is located and the decor of the restaurant it self. The staff is consistently friendly. But the food is just lacking. I think I have had one good sandwich in the many times I have eaten here. And dinner is no better, just blah food and real poorly cooked vegetables.  Too bad too as I want to support our own, hell I am paying HOA fees to help support these amenities.
2	lMb4GSPvdQohxA06lrhPCQ	cheeseburger is originally from hawaii and is super popular there.   hmm.. sorry, but that should have been the first red flag. i do like the occasional loco moco or spam musubi, and i do love poke, but for the most part hawaiian cuisine doesn't rank high on my list. cheeseburger does nothing to further the cause. the island style burger i got was topped with a grilled maui pineapple ring and teriyaki sauce, and some uninspiring shredded lettuce and sliced tomato. the patty was an unappetizing beige, with hardly any char, and was cooked through fairly well. as far as flavor, not much in that department. a very disappointing $10 burger. the oreo shake i got tasted like a few oreos tossed into water with some ice and blended ever so briefly. any attempt at consuming my beverage through provided straw was thwarted by chunks of ice. the chili cheese fries were ok, but rarely do places mess up something as simple as that. overall, i'd rather go to my local islands chain.
2	Nvq7dUV97Xn3z4E7TeVoQ	I ordered from this place due to all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed. The pizza was not good. It wasn't disgusting but not tasty at all. I think maybe it was the marinera sauce they use. Also, I oredered pepperoni and ham and got pinapple (bleh) and ham. I also ordered wings and they were ok. I did like the cheese bread, though. I'm wondering why everyone gave rave reviews... maybe I ordered the wrong pizza?
2	dCZetm4xXLoHBzeUvolA	Well, there's not really much I can say about this place.  I came here with my friend for a late night eat.  We both ordered their $8.99 late night steak special.  Granted, at 1:30am with a empty stomach, the bland steaks did their job.  Probably won't eat here again though.  The menu didn't really appeal to me.
2	lCItwKctwSI5Bs5PFwuA	This place (this location) is inconsistent with the taste of the food and the options. My family and I have been here twice for Sunday Brunch, the first trip was a HIT with the Orange Grand Manier French Toast and a $5 Mimosa which was standard. We went back the next Sunday and the french toast was over cooked, my daughter burger bleeding when she ordered it WELL DONE, my husband had hair in his food and we had a SHI&&Y waiter who only came over to take our order and to drop the check. We had to go grab a manager to send our food back..
2	gEmJuPNPI3DRsaKhPvt4mg	Don't know what happened here....we use to love this place.  But the last couple of visits was not the same!  They reduced the amount of food on their entrees.  I remember the first time I went, the bbq combo had 3 pieces of ribs, 3 pieces of chicken and a bunch of beef slices.    Last year, they reduced the amount...2 pieces of rib, 2 pieces of chicken, and a few pieces of beef.    Last week, there was 1 piece of rib,  2 pieces of chicken and 4 slices of beef!  Totally cut their food cost down half!    Also, they don't serve good tea anymore.    I guess we are done with them for awhile...
2	XUxDo3AB6XXPLaHDPa9A	Totally underwhelming Mexican food.  Even Macayo's and Chipotle burritos have cost less with bigger portions, and tasted better.  I ordered a simple rice, bean and guacamole ($6.95) burrito for lunch.  I mean, how hard can that be to MESS up?    But they piled some warm slimy goop (frijoles, I imagine) in a tortilla and called it done.  I have heard this location has been several other ill-fated restaurants before.  Let's hope this one can stay a while.  Lunch service was slower than expected - only 2 servers but with 10 parties.  Their signature dish was the poco pollo - basically a chicken chimi with heart clogging jalapeno cream cheese - a standard dish at most Mexican eateries.  Might be worth it - who knows? The inside decor is nice a warm modern Mexican look, but with booths and cheap tables/chairs throughout.  They also serve tequila and margaritas yet have NO BAR.  WTF?
4	qrNM9JVkvTq4e0p9yNf7PQ	Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill. I had been there once before about 3 years ago. I don't remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good.  Anyway, it was fairly empty for lunch. Perhaps it's because it has a darker atmosphere (today was gorgeous out) than other SS places. I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella, basil and roasted red peppers (9$). GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos, spinach, feta and onions (9$).  My sandwich was great. The chicken was nicely cooked (not dry). The mozzarella was nice and big. The basil was a nice touch and fresh. The roasted red peppers were from a can, but were good. Served on warm ciabatta. Sandwich wasn't overly salty either. The fries were surprisingly good.  GF's veggie sandwich was equally good. I usually don't like spinach, but the bite I had was nice and feta/mushroom-y. She ate all of it (which rarely happens).  I also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale. It was quite good. Nice and malty with minimal hops.

I ordered take out, so my priorities were the food and the timing.  They have all my favorites in addition to typical pizza place foods - namely Reubens and gyros.  I went gyros tonight.  They told me 20 minutes, and my order was ready within a minute of 20.  That's important to me.  The gyros were good.  Not authentic Greek restaurant good, but for a pizza place I was more than satisfied.  The bread was so good, I can't wait to try their calzones.  I tried Pickles one night, which is on the same block. There is no comparison.  Lillens definitely will join my rotation of places that give me a few brief moments of pleasure during the stupidity of my chosen field.
2	ApM1YyYZKLJHBUiKJloACg	Good quality food. But terribly slow service.  I know there is something they can do. The hostess actually took our order - thank god because the guy responsible was really slow and seemed new. They should do more to train there people.
2	JkAcKtdWq2fdw49v5QRbQ	I stopped in on a rainy afternoon. My arthritis was flaring up really bad because of the humidity. We were all hungry so we turned onto Main st and end spotted Griff's and gave it a try.       I was disappointed they wouldn't let me use my own teapot that I came in with, but there tea was pretty decent. My waitress was at least 350 lbs but she had a warm smile.  I was pretty hungry but I only had enough for a muffin. We sat inside for around 5 hours until the rain let up - I drank a lot of tea lol
2	rIvHZsZrPgSpOYFI9Nasg	I've eaten at this place a few too many times. Everyone in town always seems to want to meet up here, and I'm really not sure why.   Granted, there aren't too many other great Mexican options in the area (which is sooooo disappointing when I need a nacho fix), but this place isn't really even a "let me settle for this because it's here" kind of place. It's more of a "I should really drive to nearby Charlotte for a more delicious Mexican treat if I'm going to be spending this kind of money and consuming this many calories" type of joint.    The food always taste soggy to me, whether it's the nachos, the tacos, or anything in between. The service is consistently slow, but the staff is generally friendly...which makes up a tiny bit for everything else...but the price is not right for food this blah.
2	pOf7PXUH3vSo84ifVDndg	I am new to Yelp. Here are my star ratings:  1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back. 2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful. 3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back. 4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here. 5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.  Maybe I was spoiled during the 5 years I lived in ATL. Med Grill in Decatur. Phenomenal. The little hole-in-the-wall place on Broad Street near my office at GSU. Yum. I guess I had it good.  I started to worry when I asked if they ever featured cabbage rolls. They guy "cooking" looked at me with a blank stare and said, "my wife is Polish, she makes cabbage rolls..." Awesome.  I ordered a small Greek salad, hummus, a falafel wrap, and the kibbe special.  The hummus and falafel wrap were both bland. The pita bread was dry. The greek salad was good, with a generous amount of feta and plenty of chick peas. The kibee special was probably the best part of the meal, but they didnt have laban to go with it.  They people working there were nice enough.  Oh, last straw. The baklava was absolutely awful. Dry and tasted terrible.
4	lbH61rNbQMMC3QtSfV08w	I wish we had discovered this place sooner! Inside looks much like it did when it opened in 1957 with the old vinyl red and white chairs with the glitter. Old news paper clippings and other old memorabilia adorn the walls. My wife and I love old retro joints like this. You can get 2 eggs, bacon , sausage or liver mush, grits or hash browns and toast or a biscuit for only $4.25 Mon-Fri. What a deal! The Belgian waffles are large, fluffy and good and the hot sausage is Neese's and it delicious! Bacon is crisp, sweet and smoky. Portions are good, food always hot and service is friendly and attentive. Breakfast Mon-Fri till 11am and 12 noon on Saturday. Lunch until 2pm when they close-No Dinner hours. The place is packed on Saturdays no matter what time you get there! My wife and I are lucky 'cause we can go during the week when its less crowded. This is now our once a week go to breakfast spot!
4	uu6FUmDQXO6GEw5Uz5GVsg	I miss Charlotte, though now when I go back, the fast food ain't so good on my stomach. Bojangle's  is always on the list when I go back to the QC. Definietely get the Bo Berry Biscuits and Bo-Tato rounds!! UMMM.....
4	zGhMzBKHPFJWE3aRTND7Gw	I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's "authentic" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.  The food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist.   I have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.  My husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.  Their salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.  Portion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...  Service at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.    They also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.  Give Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you.
2	tB194GdjdJx8rXEjsXybQ	Yo, ho, yo, ho a greasy life for me!  Pirate's Fish (ampersand) Chips was my first experience into the ever so popular UK "Fish (ampersand) Chips" lifestyle. As a matter of fact I don't really even enjoy seafood to begin with....that must be why I liked the food here the first time I visited it. I went with my totally cool Yelper buddy "Fatso" (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ) and have been back a few times since our initial visit. We actually have not visited the Chandler establishment, we go to the Gilbert one (Warner and Gilbert Rd area).  The Ambiance: OK well ambiance is a bit of an excessive word in this case, but it is a room with windows a place to sit. To me this is BY FAR the worst part about this place. I honestly feel like I'm sitting in an ER waiting room, wondering if I'm going to see a doctor in the next 4 hours. The tables are made of the same material my kids "little tykes" outdoor picnic table is made of and they feel very grimy and in need of a serious power wash. There is no pirate paraphernalia nor any background music reminiscent of the high seas. The closest they come is when the 42" Westinghouse LCD is set to ESPN and they have a special on either the Pittsburgh Pirates or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  The Staff/Service: I would probably say that the the Staff and Service are right around "par" but they are real close to dropping to a quick "bogey" (sorry, got stuck on the ESPN reference there). The wait time for your food once you order it is probably 4x longer than McDonald's however the food seems a lot less complicated to make. There isn't an item on the menu that's not dropped into a fryer basket then removed after the timer sounds. I'm sure it's just the amount of time that God requires a frozen hunk of sub zero seafood to thaw in boiling hot grease but I WANT IT FASTER! For the most part the 2 employees that I have ever seen there are amiable, however you don't want to ask too many questions or get into heavy conversation. That would most likely prove hazardous to your health as the wrong spoken word or impatient glance would most likely push them over the edge of  complacency, to postal. Just smile and nod, smile and nod. :)  The Food: Since I didn't know what I would like decided to go with the phrase "I'll take one of everything". Fortunately they had a combo meal that gave you a nice sample of all the different "fish type" products. Not being a fan of seafood turned out to be a GREAT thing at this restaurant because I was served a huge basket of sizzling hot french fries topped with pounds of batter dipped.......batter! I found out that somewhere in the middle of the batter dipped batter there was in fact a small portion of "fish type" product. It's kind of like eating a "tootsie pop"except the other way around.....the batter is the best part, as opposed to the crappy hard candy you have to get through to eat the tootsie roll.   The Price: The bright spot here is that the pricing is rather inexpensive however if you stop and think about what your eating it kind of makes sense. Most everything is frozen, processed and covered in batter. Everything on the menu can be ordered as a meal with fries and a drink for around $5 - $6. If you'd like to "super size" your meal you can actually throw in pieces of fish, shrimp, scallops or crab "A la Carte" to meet your stomachs needs.   All in All: All in all I CANNOT figure out why the hell I keep going back to Pirates Fish (ampersand) Chips!!!! I HATE the atmosphere, I don't care for the employees, the tables irritate the heck our of me and the food is unhealthy, deep fried and CHEAP! The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap. REDRUM REDRUM REDRUM The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap. The food is unhealthy, deep fried and cheap.    .......oh yea, thats why.....yum!
2	4GeZPnqoDn5j34rgCT68w	Wow, I hate to sound grumpy, but I feel like I went to a different restaurant than the reviewers who gave it 5 stars. Over priced and marginal food at best. Sadly, my favorite part of the meal was the half priced bottle of wine. They had a keyboard player and violinist and they were talented, but the volume was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk. The room is so small, the music just overpowered everything. Won't be back any time soon.
4	T9LKA9mHWeZuTqJNI3o0eA	They have chocolate chip bagels and that's all you really need to know. I went there for the first time on Monday and it was pretty cute. They have a large menu and the people there seemed really nice.
4	HWmnSAm5ZCJAK6w30nmOQ	WARNING! My rating is based off the wings and beer. Nothing else on the menu.    I was a big hooters fan, but when I moved here, everyone said try this place for wings, and I did and they are great! The best ones are the honey hot wings.  I love coming here for football games tons of flat screens everywhere and happy hour is great 22oz of blue moon for $3 bucks cannot beat that price!    By the way do not get the pizza it is really awful, I suggest NYPD for NY style pizza.
2	W3TpSAbjZghud4LgaJxbg	The service was really slow. They were really understaffed. Just to let everyone know the free yelp snack is popcorn or peanuts- I cant remember what she said bc neither sounded appetizing. Happy hour prices aren't that great considering the small amount of food u get. We needed almost 3 appetizers each and we are both slim. We won't be back.
2	D1ivf5Q6tpbztF4TJdSVJw	Nothing special. From the service to the food...just not that memorable. The pork chop w/ pork belly  was just too sweet. and not  as tender.  The halibut was slightly overcooked and not special. Overall there were tons of uneaten food on everyone's plate.
2	7CqpUe4UTT2rJgSTCWcRA	The food is good and the portions are large.  The service is terrible.  The servers are just "too cool," to show any sort of hospitality.  No personality or spark.  I don't know if they hate working there or hate serving people.  It's puzzling.  Why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude?  I have been here a couple of times and it doesn't change.  They just look at you blankly, like they don't understand what you are saying.  I've never had a staring contest with a hostess before.  It's bizarre.  I wonder if they are all on Xanax...
2	YlktlzLuhIDkfaIbTEOCQ	As a dive bar this might work... as a restaurant it is a total loss. The food is far below pub grub standards and their audacity to claim "The Best Burger in Charlotte" is simply ridiculous. The service and food quality are non-existent. This place only exists because of its prime downtown location.
4	VjbGDUFpCoZZsGWWes16Mg	Quality is consistent and prices are more than fair. The staff is very kind and accommodating. It's our go to Chinese carry-out. I wouldn't say it's the most authentic, but then again, it's delicious and cheap!
2	2ZD2eSOHvKdDyZ0JpzuOA	Ugh, I hadn't been to an Arby's in "forever" and now I remember why.  Skimpy meat portions, over-salted and dry meat, and just "blah" all around.  Sure, it's fast and the service was friendly.  It's expensive for what you get, which isn't much.
2	327r4EgIcuSrWOzIeUUfPQ	The first time I went to this place I was very disappointed.  I ordered Pad Thai with tofu for takeout and when when I got home, there was absolutely no sauce or flavor to the noodles at all.  I guess when you order it not spicy, they just don't add anything to it? On top of that, the texture of the tofu was a little off and it felt overcooked.  The noodles also had a weird rubbery texture I've never experienced before. It was edible, but not good.  Perhaps I just didn't order it properly?  So a friend was visiting and we both had a taste for thai food. Nitaya was on our way to downtown so I decided we could give this place another try.  This time, I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu again, but I told them to make it Mild.  It was better than the first time I had it, but still kinda bland. The noodles were again really rubbery and just not appetizing. The portions are also kinda small for the price. I've eaten at MANY thai restaurants and this is unfortunately one of the worst.  Sorry, Nitaya Thai, I'll be trying the other thai options in town next time.
4	AiHZnbJaKsSD9qqHqahg	MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.  This is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos.   They have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.  The portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.  The tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.  The California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.  The restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.  And if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)  PS I think they are closed on Sundays
2	GpzKKTGBBdVLxaCWGZqeWA	We decided to have dinner on a Friday evening.  It was pretty busy but then again it was Friday evening and coupled with the GroupOn fervor it does brings people in.  They do have a Happy Hour from 5 to 7 and live music certain days of the week, but there is separate section devoted to the Happy Hour crowd.  We ordered the Melenzana Arrivederci (Rolled Eggplant filled with spinach & four cheese, served with tomato sauce and pasta).  The eggplant was ok but lacked flavor and the pasta was very inferior with the tomato sauce that was meh....  Also at $16, I would expect alot better.  We also ordered the Penne Alla Pepe e Nero, which was Penne in a lemon black pepper cream sauce with sausage, chicken and eggplant.  Pretty big portion but at $18 it was a fair price.  However, the sauce lacked a fresh lemon flavor and seemed more like a mustard in it for some reason or might have been overpowered with the pepper.  I understand all the pasta and sauce is made in house but the quality seemed like out of a box.  For dessert we ordered the cheese cake which was nothing great to write about either.  Giving it two starts because the service was good and so was our server, otherwise it deserves only a single star.    Even with a GroupOn, there are many good choices around for good Italian Food and will not return.
4	bHmFuWcnpXI2D9ZyIjjIfA	The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option, and the produce is always fresh. Skinny bagels have become quite the trend, and Brueggers does it justice. At times, the coffee can be mediocre, but the bagels are always fresh, and Brueggers really is a Pittsburgh staple. A skinny zesty egg white breakfast sandwich is the perfect way to go for a lite breakfast.
4	c3N3cm1mOPYfmSjYg1yTgg	The husband and I have been here 2 times now. First time we ordered the grilled artichokes and mac'n'cheese as an appetizer. The artichokes were amazing! They came with this aioli type dipping sauce that had a great tangy flavor. The mac'n'cheese was really good and came with a boar sausage on top. The portion was huge, so we took it home as a next day lunch. For dinner, the husband ordered the braised short ribs with horseradish whipped potatoes and they were AWESOME! Super tender beef and the potatoes had a great kick that melded well with the beef. I ordered the sea scallops which came with a corn risotto. The scallops were extremely tender and delicious. The husband and I kept eating off of each other's plates, both were so good. For dessert, the husband ordered a flourless chocolate cake. He loved it, and it was good, but not my favorite. The second time we came back with my father-in-law and all three of us ordered the braised short ribs. Definitely a delicious choice.   We live down the street and have a Tapatio resident card, which allows us 20% off the menu. This is a great deal, since it can get pricey. While the ambiance is a little older inside, the patio is really nice and I'd recommend sitting out there is the weather allows.
4	4gcmeUlZbHksHtRfrsTYhg	Ate here for dinner during the week while staying at the hotel. For an appetizer had house made potato chips with bleu cheese.  Waiter said the bleu cheese was also house made.  Seemed rather incredible but it was really good. For my entree I had a filet cooked medium with the same bleu cheese on top.  One of the best steaks I have ever had.  Up there with the top half dozen, at least.  I travel and eat a lot of steaks, so this is saying something.  Had a loaded baked potato on the side.  Service was fine.  Attentive, knowledgeable.  No complaints. Ambiance was fine for a hotel restaurant.
4	cRHsvXcT4rdsWumR3GAQ	Love love love Nixon's.  I'm a big fan of the political commentary, quotes and humor all around the place.  But the rest of it is great too.  Wonderful dark wood tables and booths.  I almost hadn't realized there was an upstairs the first few times I went - even though it's a small place.  Has the feeling of a neighborhood pub in many ways.  Service has always been great too.  One bartender even let me surf through one of her drink encyclopedia's to see if I could find something to inspire me.  Only problem now is that I totally loved the drink and no one else seems to know what it is by the name in the book.  (Greenie Meanie - Anyone?  Anyone???)    Food is more yummy that I'd anticipated too.  I've tried several things (Wanted to get names but I have no memory and they have no menu online) and they were all quite good.    Special note - they are closed on Sundays.  I've been there several times when I wanted to go after catching a Sunday movie and I've wondered why they looked closed.  Now I know.  Other than that they are open 11am-2am M-F and 4pm-2am on Saturday.
2	7Dztv0Bd48SawCAMepg	For some reason, one always has to wait to get a table here.  I don't know if they don't have enough staff or if they have just decided to use only half the restaurant.  With all the team ropers and tourists, I would think this place could do a steady busy, and much of it seasonal regulars.  Instead, there are never a lot of people eating there.    This could be a unique alternative to McDonald's and Denny's.  Whoever owns this place is seeing money slip across the street.
2	Wd0cNHX3M0GmSPMcgoHkIQ	Don't go! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the food a 3, service 3 and ambiance 5. Prices are high and serving size small.   The tandoori chicken is the worst I have eaten in AZ. For a moment there I was envying my dog's chew stick. Really, it sucked.  Wonder how they survive.
2	hm6V8hTtuW0B1oHzUB7aWw	Was just there this past Monday, and here's the scoop -- you have to be realistic about these kind of places.  Food is mediocre at best, but there is a lot of it and its cheap.  I definitely have had worse, but for the price (under $7 for a senior citizen including the drink), you cannot go wrong.  Some positives -- they have a basic Mongolian stir-fry BBQ, but on it, there is fresh shrimp that you can make your own stir-fry combination with.  You cannot compare this place to buffets like Zen Buffet or Pacific Seafood Buffet, but for the price, you cannot go wrong.
4	q0aWBiLGMyAQx0LOY6PEnQ	Two visits on consecutive days, two awesome sandwiches and pasta. When asked if they've been here long, shared a laugh at a very well delivered deadpan 42 years. Pictures of family everywhere, clustered italian deli and dry goods, frozen, take home and cook yourself available. Cash register must be from when they opened, very charming. Had their pastrami sandwich, italian hero, very well balanced between the that-morning-baked bread, juicy meats, and refreshing veggies. Oh, and it's CHEAP! A huge sandwich will set you back $3.25-5.55. Also they have freshly made cannolis! This will become a weekly ritual for me and my co-workers, I'm thinking.
4	aiDZGZcKSDGfblmMyBhsnw	Stopped in for lunch with an old friend.  We had lots to catch up on, so got a booth inside where it was quieter.  The decor is true to Tom's heritage at this location, modernized with lots of historical pics on the wall.  The Governor's Room has an attractive gleaming golden state seal over the doorway.    Service was excellent.  Food was OK.  Great bar with Tom's specialties, where I don't water, so no info on that.  I should have had the 1929 chili, or a burger to really try the food.  I had a Cuban sandwich with house salad instead.  The salad greens were fresh, the tiny Tom atoes sweet and crunchy.  The sandwich was a Phoenix Arizona Cuban sandwich from Tom's Tavern, not like a Cuban sandwich made by somebody's Cuban mother or Abuelo using all the right Cuban ingredients.  Kind of like Mexican food in Yellowknife, Yukon Territory.  Good test.  Next time I'm having the burger.  There will be a next time.  Ambiance 1 Service 1 Cleanliness 1 Cuban Sandwich 1
4	YbqC6wnhUGzQ7stTDh8Mw	Excellent food. Topped only by the service, which is the friendliest you'll find in Phoenix.   I had the 1/2 sammie and soup. I chose their 3-cheese grilled cheese, which was great, along with their chicken tortilla soup. It cost me $3.10.  I had a huge (generous portion) of 2% milk for $1.75 and a cup of coffee, which I heard was some pretty great coffee. I liked it, yes, but I wouldn't rave that it was the best ever.   My colleagues loved this place. They said they can't wait to come back. Good!   I was able to talk to the owner about Yelp and how we all heard of this place. I'm glad I was able to do a lunch search in the area of Eba Cafe. This place is the perfect lunch spot, followed by a quick drive over for boba tea afterwards.   They serve breakfast all day. The prices are reasonable. And, like I said, it's super friendly. So, what are you waiting for? Go!
2	gjf5urcsq5RWbZhejzBnZg	Not impressed. The offer lunch specials at a great cost. I ordered a slice of pizza and 6 medium wings. Was disappointed with the pizza being super thin and hardly had any taste, the wings weren't any better they had no taste and they were super dry. I don't plan on coming back.
4	ntHcRCwlaEEYNIn7x9HxGA	My wife and I went to Wokee Express for the first time a few days ago. I like to try new places my wife does not. upon entering the restaurant I was not excited about the decor and the seating, but it seemed clean so that got the approval from my wife. We order our favorite kind of Chinese food to give the place a fair chance. We were pleasantly surprised when our food cam out as the portion size exceeded our expectations. The food was very good and I would recommend this place to anyone. The only reason for the 4 stars is the atmosphere.
2	WpODKwf6nUjDeiQy2CE3uw	Seems everytime we come here experience varies tremendously.   This time ordered The Roma Steak medium. Came out almost raw. It came with cut red saut\u00e9ed potatoes. They were red, they were saut\u00e9ed,  but there were 5 pieces. Really 5 pieces of red potatoes which as we all know are small. A shame. Mushroom on the plate was mushy with a concoction.   Very disappointing probably won't be back again.  Now my guest ordered a Strawberry, Chicken, Avocado. 5 little pieces of strawberries.  Avocado brown and black on the plate. Chicken was tasty, but the spinach in the salad was brown and wilted. Another fail in my book. Waitress was great, the appetizer was great. The chicken wonton tacos, excellent flavors.  That is why for the 2 stars. God Bless all.
2	9rQOmJnL1QILjza0Wd7nfw	Well it is a Denny's so I shouldn't be to critical. However, the place was dirty. Hair strands and food pieces on the booth and a dirty floor. Food was typical Denny's food. Service was decent and servers were very nice.
2	lXDf1oj2wCRPoUcyAPJwcA	This location is consistent with being inconsistent.  I frequent this location because it is close to my house. ONLY REASON.  I pretty much order the same thing every time:  4 piece chicken nugget happy meal, ranch for my dip, for a boy and a apple juice.  Absolutely nothing special.  Yet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples.   So I have to make sure I check my order every time before I leave the drive thru window.  And the inside is always dirty. Always.
2	vvwpIH4KwZSE84Pq8nhAA	I guess as I'm getting older I'm seeing the value in things a little more clearly. I used to really enjoy going out to eat and didn't ever stop to wonder if I was getting a good deal. Lately, though, I've been paying close attention to what all of the foods cost and comparing them to other eating establishments.  My daughter's school was having a fundraiser at this Chili's last night. It was the kind that they donate a certain percentage of the total bill to the school. We try to help the school whenever we can, so we decided to make it a fun night out with the kids. My daughters enjoyed themselves and saw a few friends, and we all got to relax and let other people do the work.  My issue with this restaurant, though, and why I gave it two stars, is strictly with the value of the food. I understand that the costs of everything are increasing, so business establishments have to raise their prices accordingly, but they should still be able to offer a decent value.  We ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger for my wife and I to split, and the kids ordered a corn dog and a quesadilla. My wife and I usually split meals because they are so big and calorie-laden, and it helps to keep costs down. Most of the time we leave feeling full and happy. When they brought out our food this evening, though, my half of the burger was tiny! The burger was supposed to contain bacon and onion straws, and according to pictures, was supposed to be packed with them. There was a tiny piece of bacon on my half, and a few scattered onion straws. I looked over to my wife's plate, expecting to see the bulk of the toppings on her burger, but her toppings were as pathetic looking as mine. The size of her half of the burger was not much bigger than mine, either. She said hers was exceptionally greasy and didn't taste how she expected it to taste. This was a little burger to start out with, and splitting it only made it worse. And it was $10.99!!  The burgers are, like most places, served with french fries. When we split meals at other restaurants, they usually give us both a full portion of fries. I know it's not the healthiest thing to be chomping down, but because we go out to eat so infrequently we don't worry about it. We want to get a pile of fries with our meal. The amount of fries delivered with our meal last night was a joke! My wife had maybe fifteen fries on her plate, and I had about eight. Seriously?! I know this restaurant is in business to make money, so they don't want to give everything away, but how much does an extra handful of fries cost for the few people that are splitting meals.  The kids meals were, in their opinion, good. The corn dog and celery sticks were quickly devoured, while the quesadilla and oranges were left mostly intact. (typical kids!). I tried a few bites of the quesadilla. It was ok, but was pretty small because of the meager amount of cheese. The kids meals, with the included drink, are $4.99. Not cheap, but not outrageous either.  I like to leave every restaurant feeling that I got a good value for my money. I know that a good restaurant can give me that, while still making a decent profit off of me. When we left last night we looked at our bill and reminded ourselves why we don't go out very often. My wife said that she's going to keep the bill, so that any time she craves this type of food she can look at it and remind herself that we can eat much better and cheaper at home. Or at least at a restaurant that gives us our money's worth.
2	jgUyXaEWwL7s11bdOuwQ	My wife and I have been driving by Joey's for two years and last Saturday evening we were in the mood to try someplace new.  I'm always up for trying a new restaurant.  The Adventure! The Curiosity! The excitement!  Oh, lets not get to carried away here.  I'm a pretty decent self-taught chef and my standard is simple: The food had better be at least as good as I can prepare at home.  I had the Rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce.  This is a dish that's hard to screw up, and they didn't.  It was fine. But 15 bucks?  We're talking about a few cents worth of pasta, some cream and parmesan, and about a quarter of a chicken breast grilled and tossed in. Easy. Tasty. Not worth $15 hard-earned money. We're talking the same price as Macaroni Grill's Chicken Scaloppine and there is a world of difference between what went in to the two dishes.  My wife had the lasagna. She ate a small portion and asked for a cary-out container.  As we were walking to the car later she said, "The lasagna was terrible".  So why did she want to take it home?  "I dunno".  At least that gave our son a chance to render a second opinion on it.  Our son, the Army Infantry Fire Team Leader. Chows down MRE's like they are gourmet.  His verdict?  "Disgusting"  If you are going to spend fifty bucks on a meal you deserve better than this.
4	bIfyLNp67k8CxaMEWSTaA	great location for the Mercado on the downtown campus. Very convenient for grab and go.  Sandwiches are made quickly and have been excellent. I wish they had more selection of hot sandwiches - like having the mozzarella & tomato as a panini option or something like that. I usually get the BLT.  Today I tried the thai chicken as a wrap instead of a salad. It was very good - had quite a kick to it but very good. Staff is always helpful and very polite.  No inside seating but there are tables and chairs outside (too hot right now but would be great once it gets cooler).
2	Fil5RvMxTSp94dEuR1MOQ	I'm not sure when the standards for Chinese food became so lax. I can remember going to so many good Chinese restaurants when I was younger, but it now it seems most every time I try a new one I'm disappointed.  I hate to be so critical of Mr. Hunan--a mostly takeout joint--because the people behind the counter were very friendly, but the food was so oily and bland that it's hard to describe. I mean, it's hard to make "Hot and Sour Soup" neither hot nor sour, but my try of this famous soup at Mr. Hunan revealed that it was indeed possible.  My main dish fared no better. In fact, it was so bland I've forgotten exactly what it was that I ordered!   Come on, Mr. Hunan, this is the Southwest! We're not scared of some spice!!!
2	CkK9v9nsxNhwM43OisMLBA	I asked for a bacon potatoes egg and cheese burrito.... I ate 1/4 of my buritto, eggs, cheese, and huge pieces of ham??? Like huge, that wasn't bacon.... no potatoes.... I don't understand how hard it is to make this burrito.... I'd suggest going to the other place down the street on 35th ave... this place always screws up my order... oh and their veggie burrito is soup in a tortilla....
4	saLSgAK741Ormzh326u9Tg	I absolutely love this Morton's. Yes a chain, but as a guy, and a steaklover, this is a top notch steakhouse. I was a little biased because I used to live right across the street from it, but that didnt change the fact that its a good steakhouse. A total dark (or dim lit) mood steakhouse with prime cuts of steak. Well aged. Great drinks. Excellent service. One of the better Morton's that Ive been to around the country.
4	cQFv9cX8izBT5Kk8ICbsw	Every town has it's long standing greasy spoon where the old salts come to hang out over coffee and talk about the good ol' days.  Tag's is precisely that spot in Coolidge.  Food is old school diner and a little on the mediocre side  but four stars for being the place I go for a grease fix and coffee after a late night.  Tag's food is the perfect hangover cure!
2	pngKk7ZEKVP8by6iqiVJA	This place is very old, but the ownership has changed hands many times since I was a child.  When I was a kid my mom would bring me here for the best bacon cheeseburgers ever.  They were almost like sliders and my memories still make me salivate.  These days PRS is more typical bar & bar food than it's legacy suggests.  The kitchen will deliver something typical and depending on who is working you'll get something far more greasy or closer to right than wrong.  We hit this place up from time to time because it is centric to a driving route we have often and having a touchstone memory always draws me close but it is something to be wary of.  I'd like to see it revitalized to it's old glory but I don't know who manages it now or their goals.  Enter with low expectations and be surprised on occasion.
4	gqxf6f0dg9tOZx5ugstNaQ	I'm a sucker for old saloons and cool bars.  Been going to the Wagon Yard on and off throughout the years ever since since my wife & I moved here 29 years ago. My wife goes there every Friday night for Karaoke and I go with her on occasion.  Although I've been here many times I never reviewed the Wagon Yard. So where do Ibegin with this place?  To start honestly the Wagon Yard is not going to be everyone's bag. At first glance the menu is fairly standard for a country western saloon. What I like about the' Wagon Yard is they get a nice mx of people not just a western crowd.  They have a harty breakfast menu, a nice selection of sandwiches for lunch and sevreal dinner specials. None of which are pricey. Everything is very reasonalbe there.  My wife normally orders either the mini chef salad with ham. Why because the regular chef's salad with ham & turkey is huge. Even the mini chef salad is more than enough for one person. If she doesn't get the mini checfs salad she will order one of their burgers. She says they are always made to perfection & taste good.   For me I think over the years I've tried everything on their menu. My favorite is the liver & onions. Just make sure they don't over cook it. If done correctly it is FREAKING PHENOMINAL. in fact I'm salivatng thinking about it right now. :-)   CUSTOMER SERVICE: SERVICE: Our waitress normally is DJ she is Super (super) friendly and always accomodating.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but they do have decent prices and okay portion size. AMBIENCE: This is not a fancy place and they even have a pretty decent size dance floor where we can only imagine the amount of line dancing going on. CONCLUSION: Been coming here for 29 years why stop now. Overall rating of either a 3.5 or a 4
4	uVMVfmbLWUVQ4qepCUqo3g	There is a cashier who is the most awesome woman ever. She is super excited every time I walk in, and makes me feel like the best customer ever. I will find out her name the next time I go, but she is the epitome of great customer service.   The only other thing I have to say is that their soda dispenser is space age Star Trek awesome technology. You pick the type of drink you want, and any additives, and it is AMAZING. Touch-screen awesome drink magic.
2	PKWtdBGjRfXeAyi0udE5zw	so, yeah. stopped by for lunch today, had the teriyaki chicken salad. not quite sure how this was a salad - 5 strips of teriyaki chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce? ok, i'll concede that generally chinese food restaurants don't do salads well, but still. that was pathetic. chicken was fatty. sauce was flavorful. oh and my table had a funky plant/fake flower vase ... the green leaves were alive and in water, the fake flowers were mixed in with the live plant. weird.
4	PVo8yxrxN0xx83UF2a2Rrw	The Pot Roast burger is tremendous!!!  Peach pina colada tasty but not much of  a buzz.  Atmosphere is great, alternatives are non-existent.  Seriously... I'd go back for the Pot Roast burger.  I have never had anything quite like it.
4	ulyx4CEL404C91wI2eG4A	Supper Yummy!!! The place doesn't look very nice when you first walk in but don't be scared.  They have a huge menu with tons of yummy items.  The staff was really nice and even gave us a few free drinks!  I can't wait to have their dry sauteed green beans again.
2	vWwDOjvAtBdh0OKgPbIXdQ	After waiting several minutes for an old homeless man with a shopping cart to exit the drive-thru, I placed my order and pulled up to the window.  Within two minutes, I had my three piece white meat meal with mashed potatoes and green beans ($8.19), or so I thought.  I arrived home only to discover instead of mashed potatoes, I was given coleslaw.  I detest coleslaw!!!  I was planning on feeding the potatoes to my baby.  Thanks, KFC.
4	dXGfGynAb1hTlYQ7GATApw	My girlfriend bought me a round at the Pinnacle Course for my birthday (I don't even want to know what she paid, but it was August so at least it was the summer rate).  This place pretty much ate me for lunch, shot in the low 3 figures but I did birdie the Par 4 6th, so there.  However, it needs to be said, this course is gorgeous and you are treated like a king, which more than makes up for the high score.  The only lowlight were the 4 snooty old women who were behind us and played like their cars were double-parked.  I could go on for hours about these idiots, but who in their right mind plays a course like Troon from the freakin' red tees and constantly tells those in front of them to play faster (when we are keeping up the pace with the group ahead of us), excuse us for wanting to enjoy ourselves.  You may have more money but I still know how to enjoy life and appreciate things as opposed to you old fogies, so deal with it.
2	KHv0CmN6VVVcvqzKOjoIA	Pete's Fish and Chips has a reputation for being legendary in the Phoenix valley, so of course I had to try it. And, wow, what a miss.  First of all, they had outdoor seating only, which isn't so bad I guess. Oh wait, no, we're in Phoenix, doesn't it get to be about 117 degrees F outside in the summer? Sounds like a blast.  Secondly, they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar. How on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce? Malt vinegar is a little more uncommon but for pete's (lol) sake even McDonald's has Tartar sauce.  Third, the fish itself. Speaking of McDonalds, that is what I am reminded of, this is not batter dipped and fried fillets of fish, this is minced and formed, and covered in a crunchy, crumbly breading, like what you'd find on a Mcdonald's fish sandwich.  Fourth, they only take cash. What year is it?  The red sauce they give you is OK, but it is more like a shrimp sauce, I'm sure it would be great on that. It definitely does not belong on fish.  Their Hamburgers though, are quite good and very inexpensive. If you go to Petes, get one of those. Skip the fish, it's awful. I have no idea how this place became so popular on such awful fish and chips. An Englishman would burn this place to the ground.
2	Rz7H9LMiW0pwGiX46JmFaA	I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.
2	16yIJWhnKiZrdHoDmlA	Don't alter order - you won't get it.  Asked for no salt on fries got extra salt room temp.  Isn't that why we go there?  Asked for no onions got lump of pickles.  My fault. What once was a treat is truly crap.  No you can't go back.
4	G0nOZyefy02EcgEVBff4g	I am always mad at myself after I eat at Texad Roadhouse because I get so carried away with the delicious appetizers that I never leave enough room for my entree or dessert! But it always makes for a satisfying leftover meal the next day :)  Totally delicious food. It's a tradition in my family to go here every time my parents come to visit. Great service, great environment, even better food. A+!
4	94JHQPXs32eZTlRsEfgkTA	We went for dinner on a Sunday night. We were three of five customers in the restaurant, which was off-putting. I guess they only just started serving dinner as well as breakfast and lunch. It would be a really great dinner joint if they dimmed the lights a little and played some romantic French music (instead of Johnny Cash... a bit much for nighttime).  The crepes were great. The service was great. Our server (#7? possibly the owner?) was quite jolly. I'll go again sometime.
2	GgvhHKYOlnQUpIYDgGqbYQ	Being from Texas, I am a fan of Tex-Mex which believe it or not, is hard to find in these parts.  Although not Tex-Mex, I had high hopes for Los Dos because of the rave reviews of my husband's friends and family.  Everyone was promising me this would be a break from the disappointing Mexican food I had tried in the valley.  So, off we go...and what a let down.  The food was okay, but definitely not all it was hyped up to be.  I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues...
4	1chQo49RYQAWSxBfGrlLg	Say it with me now - Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding.   When I first told one of my friends about this dessert, he told me that the thought of it made him Krispy Kreme his pants. That's before I even went into the pornographic details about how it was swimming in Makers Mark Caramel Bourbon Sauce that was set ablaze. So naughty.  I mean, I don't even like donuts all that much but it just felt wrong not to order an item that was just so blatantly taunting.   I kept my expectations at bay before dining here. It's located inside of the City Center Marriott so I was very aware that the food may be uninspiring and generic. But what I found is that Savannah Red is actually a fabulous restaurant that stands on it's own two feet, with delicious food at tasty price points   Things started off nicely with an amuse bouche of cauliflower soup, which was rich and delicious.  I like to just nibble and taste so I ordered a few small dishes. The Jumbo Crab Cakes ($8) were pretty good, but keep in mind that the Cilantro Avocado Emulsion is little a small dollop on the plate. The Diver Scallop Ravioli w/ cream sauce, wilted greens, and Sriracha gastrique ($8) was my far my favorite dish ordered. You've got to try it. the greens are cooked perfectly and the two ravioli are large, fresh and meaty.   I was given a bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate before being presented with my Pear and Endive salad, blue cheese brulee and pink apple vinaigrette. So good!  Initially, I had no plans on ordering dessert. But the bread pudding was only $6 and sounded so novel that I had to give it a try. If you like donuts, you will love it. For my own personal taste (I'm not huge on donuts) it was a bit too sweet, but the preparation and plating were fabulous!  Overall, an excellent restaurant with stellar service and an exciting menu.
2	b27b5OTy9UU17XkFqxbZNw	Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.  Would be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it.
4	yPb9TbcB4D0h1jikcY0ESw	5 stars on entertainment and fun. 3 stars for the food.  Live band, belly dancers, and accomadating owner that is there to have fun.  Food was alright, but we had a ton of fun.  If you want the same bland Phoenix dining experience, then don't go here.  If you want to be transported out of the heat exhausted norm of Phoenix, then go to this lively plate smashing venue.  Anytime I hear OPA, I think of this place.
2	lmtmG4CoEyOGgmQszf1w	The food tastes good but the portions are small and the plates are expensive.  The atmosphere is "cute". If you have kids it is hard to guess if they would like it or hate it. (I've seen some kids get excited and others become frightened.)  I've eaten at the Phoenix and Las Vegas locations.  Although I think the Phoenix location is more professional, the staff always seems lost or confused.... honestly, I could take it or leave it.
2	mLdlIPnzuPh1vSfJhWB2Ag	The food here is NEVER fresh, you can tell it all sits under heat lamps.. too many times I have ordered food without mustard or without mayo to have it slathered all over my order. The salads usually have wilted lettuce and a foul smell...  I now drive the extra few miles to go to the one on baseline and rural. I agree with the previous review.. they have let me down time and time again.
4	TR51XrBHpBRywo0NBbgvQ	I'm Asian and love authentic, down home Chinese food but sometimes I get the hankerin' for good old Americanized Cantonese food like at Yao.  The owners are super nice and the place is clean and fast and the portion sizes are out of control.  Also $2 Tsingtao Beers anytime!!  It's easy to drive by and never feel like stopping in but the the place is great.  Don't Panda, Don't Pei Wei, Don't PF - go to Yao and support local, hard working folks.
4	FR4d72mUnxHFh3U9W378g	Went back the other night and of course the food was good, but this time the service was ...  not as good as normal and we actually ended up speaking to the manager who made things right.    We will certainly be back again and be sure to try the Vodka Rustica as it is awesome!
2	Oo6nr6JIOLtxXLCpjhww	Just okay. Often crowded on weekends for food that while I'm sure well prepared is not the most flavorful.    This store is literally NEXT DOOR to the headquarters of Eat N Park so it's a safe bet that this is the best one there is.  Strawberry pies being the exception to the rule.    There are better places to eat for the same money.
4	wO06xYWYil8J8gGHptbhQ	I go here for the drinks and the avocado eggrolls.  Back when I ate meat I loved the pasta with chicken and asparagus.  I never order cheesecake here though.... maybe I just don't think cheesecake is worth the calories.
4	AfqNnLWycQcBOAzQpPAspw	Forget about the spicy Korean chicken!!  Repeat after me..  Kalua pig. Kalua pig. Kalua pig.  The kalua pig was better than what I had in Maui.  The pork was so juicy and tender with hint of smoke, and it was mix with perfectly cooked cabbage which allows you eat the whole plate without the need for a drink.  I can not wait to get hungry again, so I can have more Kalua pig.  Kalua pig. Kalua pig. Kalua pig.
2	iU6bSVpLPANpGTsq56fnYA	Jaipur is definitely a hit or miss kind of joint. They do lack consistency in quality, flavor, spice distribution and amount of food given.  Today the order came out completely wrong and had to be redone. The shrimp tikka masala was made of rubbery chewy farmed fish and the medium heat was non existent. There was no spice involved. The tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today. It was very runny and overpoweringly tomato based.   The first experience I had merited 3 stars, the second time I ate there they qualified for 3.5 stars, and this last time they really went down to 1 star. I'm averaging them out at 2 stars after three tries.  I've exhausted my attempts. The inconsistency is too great and for the price they shouldn't be lacking at all. I will not eat here again.
2	B0iFLhKV6Mjro8u9jQrN5A	Hubby loves this place...I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice.  We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent.
4	UdQtMA1l9G8RRQ0cIL5HDQ	I was a little apprehensive returning to another Sonic after some really bad experiences at locations in California but eating here made me a believer again. Needless to say I've been back twice since the original visit and its starting to show.
4	WixtK1gxQDtYjMNdSRkHtA	Kinda dumpy, and not entirely in an endearing, it's-an-almost-hundred-year-old-place kinda way.  Service was ok-ish, music terrible (live music Friday nights - not a fan myself).  This place gets 4 stars for the food.  Burger and fries.  Epic win.  Burger with bacon, dried apples (??? I know, right?!) and a huge gob of blue cheese on an english muffin.  Fries were awesome, too, served with a giant cuppa ketchup.  Burger was slightly overdone, unsure whether there was ordering confusion or what happened (I shared the burger w/ a friend, we both agreed it was awesome despite unfortunate well-doneness).  I liked my drink, I paid 15.50 for two of em which is a pretty good deal.    All-in-all, a surprisingly accessible yet highly unique place - offbeat.  Seems like it needs a look at the details - a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.  I'm totally coming back here when I need a place with character.  I'm psyched about getting the food here again, too.
4	bLH9rHq8SKR2PWBYRoYLcw	Nice place. I ate breakfast here this week.  The meals are good and the buffet is very nice with more than the normal options like Eggs Benedict, Egg Blintz and more.  A little on the expensive side, but good service.
2	eNW5CVMd98Gdzye7wf6b0g	This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.  We stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.  We looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.  The waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.  After we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.  It's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.
2	R8m5vTsBiOseZStpczkTw	This Wendy's is REALLY SLOW at getting food out. The food is pretty standard for Wendy's, but the service is SUPER SLOW. Also, this tends to be the dinner spot for a lot of the homeless from around the area- so carry some loose change.
4	ENi7a2EgBvOiGPMbv2ng	Prior to this visit , I was a Longhorn virgin.  So to be fair, this review is based only on my very first visit which was good and I'd go back if I could press replay on this visit. That being said, I am surprised by the low rating here.   Three of us shared the Texas onion (similar to OB bloomin onion) but we liked this version better.Wild west shrimp was also shared. Cherry peppers gave it a nice zing.  Salads that came with the entrees were fresh and big. Had we known it came already dressed, we would have asked for it on the side.But it was a perfect amount anyway.  I had the porterhouse, great, cooked the way I like it. Nice tender ,flavorful. Mashed taters were good.  Friend had filet (7oz.) again, tender,cooked the way requested, good. Served with giant loaded baked potato.  Last dish was a new menu item ( I don't know how new, like I said this was my first visit.)Parmesan crusted chicken .  Menu states " two juicy chicken breasts grilled and topped with parmesan cheese and garlic crust." Surprisingly, It was described just as it was served. She enjoyed it!  Service was great ! So much to the fact when the manager came over to check in and see if we enjoyed our dinner , I made a point to compliment the excellent service.( I'm sure the verbal compliment was just the icing on the cake. The real compliment was the nice tip I left !  I'm not sure if they have a lunch menu But I did notice the dessert menu.None of us had room for dessert.  The place is big and looked as if it had a private dining spot.  Listen, I am not a steak house aficionado.But based on this visit, I like Longhorn chain better then O.B and L.S.
2	U565knoHmCIbj4UfHQQ	Now I remember why I stopped coming here.  It takes FOREVER to get your food.  I realize it's a small kitchen with one guy back there but for 3 orders (2 ahead of me) it shouldn't take 25 mins.  Foods decent but I'll head to Frederico's on Cave Creek any day over this place.
4	Tza7PtIWkqjT8XNF3u4xQ	I love breakfast and after a night of catching up with old friends and staying up way too late, we ventured over to Crackers.  We were seated fairly quickly and the service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is cafeteria-like with outdated decor.  However, the menu has all of the regular breakfast offerings and then some.  I went with the Farmer's skillet and it was great.  My only complaint is that the potatoes were not crispy enough for my liking, but all in all, the flavors were good and it hit the spot.  Next time,  I think I will go with the Vatican, which got good reviews from one dining companion.  The only real negative was that the tortilla that came with the huevos rancheros was a little hard.  All in all, this is a good breakfast stop for the basics in a secluded strip mall behind the Home Depot.
2	faUYCMy0KphdJjouVjIUA	Another bar that is full of regular's. Nothing wrong with that, but maybe they should treat everybody who walks into the bar like a regular. I'm never gonna be a regular at any bar (just my nature), so I guess I will never have the joy of being an old man at the bar trying to tell the gorgeous 23 year-old bartender (dark hair, ponytail, sleeve of tats) about my pathetic day at ole construction site or my latest doctor's appointment. Being a regular just means that those hot bartenders have to listen to your crap, but if you think they really care, then I got some oceanfront land in Arizona to sell you.  This is definetly leaning towards a biker bar as magazines about that lowlife aspect of society are present in the bar. Leather up! Yes and old TV sets too except for one nice giant screen in the back. Roomy bar area too.
4	yKMIc8ffjUjvmMP8ZN1Jlg	Simple, cheap. This place probably hasn't changed for decades.   There really isn't a formal menu..just a list of what they offer on the wall. Your waitress will tell you what everything costs, but it's so reasonable..just order what you want.  I usually get the two egg breakfast: eggs made to order, grits, toast-or-biscuit and a meat. Plus coffee. And it's only $4.50!   Note - they only take cash and close around 1:30 pm
4	0X1XbQvrT7AA8C6TWA2VsQ	After visiting Donatelli's today as part of a Yelp Event, my husband and I returned to purchase Cheese Ravioli, Grandma's Plain Sauce, and Chocolate-Covered Almond Biscotti for dinner. After having tried all three this evening, I can definitely recommend Donatelli's food and look forward to having these items again!
2	Yrl0ZIFyhkzv9Hna2lwow	I am from Chicago and have only found places I like.  Hadn't tried Nellos and heard it was good, so my wife and I went there today for lunch.  We had their thin crust deluxe.  Was disappointed.  It was very thin, but crust was not airy, like I am used to.  And being from Chicago, I like my Italian Sausage, not pepperoni.  The sausage was bland and was almost freeze dried.  No flavor, not moist.  It crumbled.  Very disappointed.  Sorry.
2	aQCAKCnj9Elbqnnm7MJzXQ	I would have probably rated this place 3 stars or higher in the past, but the place still smells like smoke, years after the statewide no-smoking in restaurants ban.   Lunch dishes tend to be very small.  One piece of fish on a fish and chips, etc.   The wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating.
2	FZXDBlQM9BI0X4vgitmQ	A bit dissappointing.  I have no idea how anybody would rate this place higher than a 3/5.  For those with a 5/5, what are you thinking?  All I can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp.
4	olbLomtXGX5cWMCUFer1g	I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator.
2	w51Pp2dnJj2XbmI31HJw	Dude, did you really turn to a co-worker and say, "you take this order, I don't have the patience to wait for this" while my 9-year-old was trying to tell you what he wanted on his sandwich? There were no other customers in the store at the time other than me and my children, so I'm not sure if you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or if you somehow mistakenly think that your job doesn't involve serving people no matter how long it takes to place the order.  Major customer service fail.
4	FdpJEkPBf38JYs2hmfehQ	This is the watering hole closest to my humble abode, so I may be a little biased, but I love this place. It's exactly what I would picture when given the phrase "hole in the wall bar", and that's what I'm looking for when I just want to relax and unwind or even pregame.  The bartender/server/foodrunner/barback that basically runs the place (I seriously don't know what the owners would do without her) is so nice and a very cool person to interact/chat with.   The food, while not as extremely diversified as it could be, is always prepared when you order it and comes out hot and delicious.   They have a cool side patio to smoke on. The bar also falls right on the Orbit route so it's just a quick lift back home or to a different location.
4	uY0LJELbmIV8LXlaauBEw	Just had another wonderful dinner at Ruth's Chris with friends.  Ruth's is a wonderfully prepared steak with great attention to the service.  I cannot think of a time when the appetizers, salads, steaks and side dishes were not prepared perfectly!  My wife had lobster and she noted that it was a tad overcooked but she is a trained chef so I know sometimes she spots things that I never would.  Overall, if you are looking for a special night out with great steaks, go to Ruth's Chris!  I doubt you will be dissapointed!
2	QQBlXRNoNZCScaGcVoA	The service at this location is really good, but on more than one occasion, the food that I've gotten hasn't been really good.  Many times the chicken seems to be cold and the sides appear to be a little old.  The customer service is great, my only complaint is that at lot of times they try to avoid giving you a bag and put all of your order in the box.  This isn't a bad thing, I just have a pet peeve about being given greasy napkins :)  It's a known fact that if you put the napkins in the box with the fried chicken, that the napkins are gonna be saturated with grease.  Note:  The drive thru line can be a bit long on Sunday afternoons, so save yourself some time by going inside.
4	e51qjGhPXbE2uLHP25l9YQ	Awesome food and a big selection of Wine. The pizza ranks as "pretty good" for east coast standards, but "damn good" for Phoenix for sure. The house specialty is some kind of pasta-alfredo-chicken and a few other choice ingredient combo which is REALLY RICH and tastes great but sits pretty heavy. It's a nice place to go for dinner for 2 and not blow tons of cash (if you live way out there).
4	IA9IgSP07OmIN3EDKhnwg	I brought my partner to Upstream for his first visit.  We had a table in the middle of the dining room.  I love the look and decor of Upstream (especially the ceiling!) so this felt very cozy.  The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level.  There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen.  I understand (and enjoy!) the concept of "open kitchen" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants.  The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates.    Anyway, we had fantastic service.  Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal.  To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls.  We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us.  And she was right.  It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes.  The only disappointing thing was the portion size.  Good thing we got the bento box, too!  I ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices!) to go with it.  The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too.  Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal.    All in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon.  There are so many other options out there and Upstream didn't "wow" us enough to return time and time again.
2	NEwmOsmM1wgCWXf2YQNwhQ	If you stop eating frozen custard for a while and then go back to it, you  wish you never tried it again.  After a few years frequenting this place, the Oreo malt is the only thing I consider ordering. And that is only if someone I'm with really wants to go and is paying for it. Prices are obscene. All of the food is greasy, bland, and expensive.
2	kmEKgbWe6fH42xRBtIARtQ	There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min, walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet. This has happened on two totally different occasions.   The workers themselves are ok and the managers are nice.
2	JoUKHO2a3RZOaKUsky8WeA	Meh is the perfect descriptor for Porta Alba.  We went with a group of friends, of whom 2-3 had been at the old location.  I have no complaints about the decor, and really none about service.  Neither stood out for good or bad reasons.  The food...yeah, meh.  The pizza was okay.  (And yes, I am aware this isn't supposed to be American pizza.  I've tried pizza all over the globe and like each variation for its own reasons.)  Even my husband, who will pretty much eat anything and at least say it was okay, was pretty meh about it.  I had a special pasta dish.  Just based on that, I would give a 3-3.5 however because it's not a normal option and what I tried of my dining companions' food was also meh, it's not enough to raise the overall score.  Upon leaving the restaurant, my husband and I immediately named this a we-won't-pick-this-restaurant-again-but-won't-throw-a-huge-fit-if-a-group-of-friends-want-to-go place.  Thankfully, we haven't had to go back.
2	5JcopCMD4pq2V5tNRr7vMg	I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed "best burger" in Pittsburgh, as it had been recommended to me.  I guess I was expecting more flavor - some kind of house seasoning or something special, but it was very ordinary.    It was quite busy and seemed a little cramped inside.  They seated us near the window facing LIberty, which was great - but the way the seating was arranged, my friend had her back to it.  I generally prefer  tables perpendicular to the window which allow everyone to look out occasionally without craning their neck.  I'm hesitant to go back, because the burger was the best-sounding thing on the menu and it wasn't that great.
4	udMlo0ySd0vohhYAMastEg	Cracker Barrel is so dependable for down-home American comfort food!  My boyfriend and I were in Phoenix, heading back to our part of town on I-10.  We decided Cracker Barrel would be the perfect stop for brunch.  The wait was 25 minutes that Sunday around 1pm.  We didn't mind, because we spent that time perusing the old-fashioned candy and timeless children's games in the gift shop area.  I also love checking out the latest and greatest kitchen gadgets and decorative plates, etc. in the gift shop.  I purchased a cute muffin pan with a snap-on lid perfect for bringing baked goods to work!  The food was outstanding and definitely fresh.  I love the apple cider in a mug too!  Mmm I think that's my favorite thing on the whole menu!  I can't get enough of that tasty cider!  The biscuits are so yummy too!  Cracker Barrel food never disappoints me.  The service was a bit short, since they were so busy, and that wasn't too cool, but I'm still giving this review 4 stars, because service is usually much better at this location.
2	6HJrJvHnQCxTuv9F23G1jg	This recent trip was the first time I've been to a jack in the box in 10 years and the first time I've ever gone sober.    I got off of work and was very hungry, realized I had no food at home, and made the impulse decision to stop in here.  There was no line so I ordered quickly.  My food was ready in a few minutes.    First, these sandwiches look absolutely nothing like the pictures.  Smaller, grayer, and totally unappealing to the eye.  The taste was blah but whatever I just wanted some food in my belly.    Second, the place was full of crazy people.  They were being loud and obnoxious and generally behaving like crazy people do.  I should have gotten drive-thru but ate inside because i was hungry.    I plan on not going back for another ten years, or at least not when I'm sober.
2	HrHdGvE8MVdRIFcd3w7tpw	It was late at night in Vegas and we decided to have some Korean food instead.  The food is okay, but it was a little overpriced according to their portion.  Be prepared to pay 15% gratuity if you have 4 or more people.  "All you can eat BBQ" was not bad for just $20, but have to finish it in an hour.
4	7UmOn5tNwT8N91CAbGsvew	I am definitely a fan of their subs, they have always been fresh and tasty. I do have one complaint on the "Chicken Caesar salad" which I had ordered awhile back. To be honest it was a pathetic excuse for a Caesar salad. First of all my chicken was heated in the microwave which was a little unappealing and the texture was a little off. Second, there was no croutons, no parmesan, and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix. To top it all the dressing wasn't a creamy caesar dressing so I was 100% disappointed with this salad. I would have named it the Plain Microwaved Chicken Salad.
2	ejSu9v8Fdy5yx0e42VataQ	We usually have to wait close to an hour for a table on a Saturday night, but this weekend the wait was only 10 - 20 minutes.  I don't know if it is the ecomony or the food, but it was unusual.  It's Tony Romas, so what can we say.  It is a restaurant chain located inside a casino in Downtown Las Vegas.  The food tastes pretty much the same as any other Tony Romas.  The wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  The ribs were great (4 of us had ribs), and we added their red hot BBQ sauce, which made it yummy.  My mom had the prime rib special and she was happy.  We started with the onion loaf, which is a treat for onion lovers.
4	jOy9qJWuepLokHXvPoREA	Mac Alpine's is an Original Soda Fountain.  Pretty sure it's the only one left in the city.  When you walk in you can sit on one of the stools at the original bar and one of the lovely folks there will make the drink or ice cream desert of your dream.  A fizz, an egg cream, a malt or even a simple Dr Pepper float.  You name it, they can make it.  The ice cream deserts rock in their simplicity.    There are some very cool original booths still left, and some extra seating in the back.  It's not a huge place by any means, but I've never had to wait for a table - even when they were a stop on the First Friday bus route.  Folks who came by acted like they were in a museum - just looking at all the cool stuff - some of which is for sale - and left.  They have NO idea what they were missing out on here.    The ONLY thing that makes the place not get 5 stars is that they don't offer french fries.  Their burgers are awesome - but without the fries, I stick more to their amazing BLT or their messy but good good egg salad.  Both of those go great with their potato salad - which I think is one of the best ever.    The absolute best part?  We had 2 meals, 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25.  Bam baby.
4	jtqcos4bLyLlX2z1KRvWw	Exactly the NY style pizza taste I was craving tonight.  My only complaint was there was too much cheese/sauce so it was a little greasy and hard to eat.  Wings were good too!  Food was very hot and staff very friendly.  I called in the order for pickup and was hoping to find a menu online since we hadn't been in there but they don't have a website yet - what restaurant doens't have a website???
2	sBd2xsZbY395qhafVEw2vg	Went to Shady Grove this afternoon and sat at the bar for a quick lunch.  It was anything but!  I originally went to order one of their "taters" - a loaded baked potato and the server told me, sorry we don't have them and that we are in the process of changing the menu.  Thanks...then I waited 25 minutes for her to bring my second choice.  The BBQ chicken wrap was okay as far as nourishment is concerned.  I wouldn't go back.  It looks like a cute cafe from the outside but its clear this place is a bar, serving bar food with bar service and bar atmosphere.
4	kczNr4hT5oLuVZfLRBhUsQ	It's about time I write a review for Malee's!  After all, I've been more times than I can count... in addition to the Yelp event (which was fantastic), I've been to Malee's in large groups, small groups, and solo.  I've also done take-out various times including tonight!    I love the Desert Ridge location because they have sushi in addition to a really large thai menu.  It's great because you can order edamame, seaweed salad, or sushi appetizers and then get a thai entree... or you can get a thai appetizer and sushi dinner.  (I'm a big fan of mixing and matching!)  I also like that Malee's is open to substitutions in dishes if necessary.  Some of my favorite thai appetizers are the siamese kisses and summer rolls.  I also enjoy the pad thai, and all of the vegetarian options.  As of tonight, I have a new favorite dish at Malee's... the thai basil curry clam house special.  It's a mouthful, but it's awesome!  I ordered it with medium spice and had them add veggies.  Wow.  Phenomenal!  I was happy it came with rice (your choice of white or brown) because I sopped up the broth with the rice... and I have to admit, I thought about drinking the extra broth too - it was that good!  Service is usually great and everyone is friendly at Malee's.  By far the BEST thai food in the area, and the best restaurant in the Desert Ridge shopping mall.  The only suggestions I have are these:  please add an eggplant entree or at least allow me to add eggplant to the dish I choose to order, and perhaps a thai garden salad with peanut dressing.  Other than that, Malee's rocks and still supports my theory that I was thai in a past life.  See you again soon, Malee's!
4	IHdZiXBBnzzIgqjGWU7RA	I ordered the Pittsburgh Steak Salad and LOVED IT. My client had the Italian Sandwich w/fries and said it was really good too. So, about my steak salad..well done slices over a ample amount of greens, mozzarella cheese, thin carrot slivers, black olives, cucumbers AND french fries..I kinda, sorta drenched it in Ranch dressing. Mmmmmm!!! Yea, the place is outdated on the inside, but the food makes it all worth the visit. My waiter was friendly, as well as the other staff. Will definitely be coming here again! Sorry, no pictures. I forgot lol. Oh, and ample amount of parking. That's always a plus!
2	A8ITgfa0LEuays5I8t2gKw	This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come, and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.  With all the wonderful dining options in the Strip, I'm confused as to how this place survives.
4	wmXPZSfguDFaiSom1gP0w	Pick Up Stix is not as popular as some of the other fast Chinese restaurants but is still very good. For first timers who are not sure what to get, go with the "House Chicken" it is incredible and happens to be there specialty. The lunch special is hard  to beat that Jake C. mentioned. The only bad part is that it only includes the "House Chicken" so for the few of you out there who don't like it might be out of luck. If you are picking up, be sure to call a head because you might be waiting for a while otherwise.
4	P649kAjNLJVerzKPCVKQ	Dined with a good friend of mine while in town, so the slow(ish) service was no bother. Actually, we had good service. They were on top of my need for water with lots of ice.  Lisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good. The portion was large and she took about half home.  I got the chimichanga. It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the best Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese.   They have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.  I'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was grand and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)
4	K0iX19tHPfSMFnPc3ZRJw	I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.
2	kcBgfLmIeseooXjiiYjLKw	First, this place is located in a gas station.  Not that it makes it bad.  In fact, it makes it more appealing to me.  Unfortunately the food was just meh.  The shredded beef had very little flavor to it.  The enchilada sauce also needed some spice.  I guess if I was drunk off my rocker I might want everything on the menu.  Being sober, on a Saturday around 1pm, this place definitely needed some help.
2	aYTaFcCBRFlvoLqraa7dQ	really disappointed after going here on 9/30. ordered a am crunch wrap meal. half way to Madison, i took a bite of it and it was cold. not that big of a deal but got to the hashbrown was rock hard. like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours. then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager. pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that. then she proceeds to tell me that the person preparing it may have not noticed it. doing some food prep for my job, i called bs on her.   in the end, would not recommend the taco bell.
2	OdLESDnP9UGwoToR4ktCg	I keep hearing good things about Neo Tokyo and have driven by it way to many times. I went for lunch the restaurant was empty well waiting for my food I saw everyone was getting take out. The staff was really friendly the restaurant really clean... I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well. I will not be going back for lunch anytime soon.
2	ZXu9uCr3xrpmlV4XJZhUDg	My friend was super excited to get some crazy bread - she kept talking about it since we left Portland.  So I headed over to the Luxor food court from Mandalay for them.  The bread sticks were a little tough and needed more parmesan cheese.  Luckily, we got the dipping sauce to soften it up.
4	TpNoeJtv40c84uPoD6KQ	Beautiful course with a reasonable mix of Pars. I only made it to the 15 before it became too dark. Though it was busy, I wouldn't say it was overbooked.  I would definitely go again.  This time of year it gets really cold towards sunset on this course, bring a sweater!
2	T1hBNwBL978D4fAj5hF2FA	The salad bar is about the only thing going for it.  Had hoped that a place that is generally pretty busy would be a great supper club, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.  The feel, the decor, the bar are typical supper club but the entrees...nope.  My wife and I have tried the Friday fish fry 2x and both times were very disappointed. The fish looked and tasted exactly like they came from a box of VandeKamps frozen fish filet.  Same unnatural shape, thin, with same breading.  Nothing like a true beer battered cod or haddock.    I think the only reason the place is busy is due to the cheap prices and lack of other options in the area.  We won't be going again, it may well be the worst fish fry I have ever had in my life.
4	7oHHsyCm6FmWZn9qlOxI0Q	Honestly, they can get some better quality ingredients if they're going to charge so much for a sandwich.  However, they make a good sandwich - not all sloppy, not oversized, good combination of ingredients.  I will probably go back and pay the hefty price next time I'm in the vicinity.  :)
2	yjhendabs1kgUAUiiq2r3Q	Seems a litle overpriced for chicken, fresh or not.  I think if you skip the value meals and just get singles pieces of chicken, it may be a little more worth it.  This place doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo Wild Wings.  BW3's has more sauces, more selection and better prices.  I'd say hang on to your $$ and go get a snickers bar.
2	DexMJ7T3Zel4bJSaOkuVpw	I've never really regretted choosing to go to a fast food place, but this particular visit was definitely not the best.  I was actually circling South Park for a place to eat before heading to a meeting so it had to be quick... most of the places in this area are sit-down places and take a while so I stopped in here.  The people were friendly, but it took a long long time to get my food and then I decided to sit down and eat rather than stuff my face and run.  I did overhear a lot of employee conversations about going home and their feet hurting, etc.  I think they were in the middle of a shift change, but it's hard not to hear that stuff when it's being yelled from the cash register back to the kitchen.  Atmosphere aside... the sandwich was dosed in mayo like someone was trying to put out a fire with it.  The fries.... were scalding hot (that's what was the hold up with the food - and also the drive thru line).  They also ran out of ketchup containers so I had to be creative and put ketchup on a napkin in a big blob.  Oh well - get what you pay for though I guess.....
2	H1ebnubnwZqu6WJNSf18g	Date: February 2012, a Sunday morning around 9AM  Ordered:  1 - Fried Zucchini 2 - Steak and Eggs  1 - Ice Tea  1 - Coffee   Total: $25 to $30  *************  Fried Zucchini - Tasted like fish. Other than the fish oil it was fried in, this was a good deal. The zucchini was cut in quarters lengthwise and you received about 8 pieces, accompanied with ranch.  I am willing to give them a second chance on this dish.    Steak and Eggs - This was a steak just didn't taste right; either it was old or very poor quality. I ordered my steak medium, and it was served well done, not a speck of pink.  The eggs were cooked correctly. The hash browns and toast that this was served with were both on the verge of burnt.   *************  Atmosphere:  Spacious.  This caf\u00e9 is large; they have 3 sections, one outside on a gated patio.  There was a group of "regulars" sitting at the counter  Service:  The waitress was satisfactory.   *************  Will I be back? Maybe... only if I am craving zucchini and am willing to take a chance.  But then again, Brothers Restaurant is across the street and they are great.    P.S. Currently there is a great deal of construction going on there.
2	Gllm0UuyeJtuRY4DqOhJTw	Been looking for a good Indian restaurant for awhile now, and it looks like I am going to have to keep on looking.  The staff was very unfriendly, not even saying welcome, or how are you today?     The food itself was okay, nothing worth going back for, but not something that I wanted to walk out over either.  The only real redeeming item was the Rice Pudding that my husband had for desert.   Overall not a place that I would tell people to go to.
2	Dm8vbZf1K86soIdzfPM90w	OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.  This restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:  Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.  Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.  The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.  Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.
4	FCIKw6iO01YA8gy1AUigQ	This place a little dive breakfast spot with a golf nick knack theme. There's golf stuff everywhere, golf clubs on the walls, golf clubs and tees as light fixtures, golf pictures. It's definitely a dive but they serve a pretty darn good breakfast.   Not to mention, it is SO CHEAP!  There's nothing over $6 on the menu. I got 4 slices of french toast, 2 eggs, hash browns, and sausage for $5.50. I mean, $5.50?!?!?!?! You can't even go to McDonalds and get some crappy breakfast for $5.50! Not to mention, the food is good.   There's usually a wait on the weekends, especially in the winter months because it's a winter-visitor haven. On any given weekend you generally can count about 30 smiley blue hairs.   It's tucked away behind an old-time Western strip mall and can be hard to find, as you can't see it from Apache Trail. But if you can find The Good Apple Natural food store, it's right next door. If you're ever out east during breakfast time, it's definitely worth checking out.
4	8WTmzVAZfdCKEdezsQNQ	Nice lounge with real people.  The patrons are friendly, easy going and mature, and the music is eclectic - James Brown, Tom Waits, the Black Crowes...keep going.  Good hamburgers and cheddar broccoli.  Also a great black bean burger.  Excellent place to grab lunch.  Reminds me of Southport Avenue in Chicago.
2	XBRn86fthgmKMcvxJZayA	Madison is not a great Italian food town, but there are certainly better choices than Porta Bella, which serves up uninspired versions of  standard checkered-tabecloth Italian dishes for $15-20 an entree, in a dim room that looks like an abandoned Legion hall.  Nowhere close to Osteria Papavero or Lombardino's -- to be honest, the food here tastes pretty much the same as the meatball sub I can get at the FIB's cart for 5 bucks.
2	fdQC6reYrwi3qsyPQW2BQ	I hadn't read too many great reviews about this place on Yelp! but a friend suggested I try this place before I left Wisconsin so I decided to give them a try.  Despite hearing fairly good reviews about the pizza I planned to get Ians the next day (my last Saturday in Madison) so I decided to go with a cheeseburger instead.  We arrived and were waited on in a timely fashion.  I placed my order for a Chicago burger with American cheese (see pic) and my friend ordered the appetizer sampler (see pic) thinking it would be a regular sized sampler.    My burger arrived in about 20 minutes.  It was cooked he way I asked, medium-rare.  The burger itself was pretty decent, but nothing memorable.  It was fairly dry but not really ridiculously so.  Instead of fries I got a side salad which was ok, although you'd think tomatoes were in short supply in the world since I only got one 1 tiny cherry tomato in my salad.  I also didn't like the lack of cheese in my salad but lots of places don't offer that so no big deal.    My friends appetizer turned out to be HUGE, about what 4 or 5 people would snack on while waiting for their dinner.  I tried a couple of hot wings, a bbq wing and cheese stick of of the tray.  The wings were meaty but not particularly hot (as in hot/cold hot) and the hot wings weren't particularly spicy either, rather bland.  The bbq wings had a decent amount of sauce but the hot wings were definitely not sauced enough.  The cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste.  All in all the sampler tasted about like the burger, pretty decent but pretty forgettable.    So I guess my bottom line is this place is alright, I'd go hear again if a friend suggested it but I'd never come back here on my own initiative.  They do have a really nice patio out back and their beer list looked really strong so that'd probably be the main thing for me to ever want to try if I were to come back.  Oh that and the pizza of course.  And just a note, the service was fine and the restaurant seemed pretty nice, as well as clean, it's just the food was not particularly great, just average.  This place reminds me alot of TGIF's, of which I'm not a fan of...  Although I didn't taste the pizza it looked pretty decent from the people sitting around me and it's possible, although unlikely from the reviews on Yelp!, that the pizza may be the item to order here.  It's highly unlikely I however will ever find out..
4	VWuLYQGtH9Bpiq4X458iw	i love china seas we order a lot love their sweet and sour chicen and their General Tso chicken they will mke it to your wants i cant eat spicy food but my son loves it so they will adjust it to your liking eggroll  are good woman that anwered the phone was very nice my food always arrives hot  love you china seas!
4	TMMUGjiYKQ265nlJ4GPowg	Stopped in for a bite while my car was being worked on at a local dealership. Pleasantly surprised at the quality and portion size of my lunch. Service was great and the price was right. I will be back.
2	zxUeRZNdCjlYxkorAddw	I have tried giving  Filiberto's three chances for improvement, each in a different location. Yet, with each visit I am more disappointed. I have to say that the one on Guadalupe Rd is the worst I have ordered from. Not only was the customer service a disaster, almost borderline rude, but the tortilla for my shredded beef burrito tasted old and crispy. Flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that. The next time I want some quick Mexican food, I am going to stop by Moreno's Mexican Grill, even if it is a bit farther away than a Filiberto's. I gave it two stars, because they do have complimentary chips and salsa bar, and so that does deserve some merit.
4	Wf3TKw8KBowmwbYhD3al8Q	I work in Tempe and this Counsin's Subs in quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots.  They are quick!  I've never waited more than 5 mins for my food.  Usually my sub is ready even before I get my fountain drink.  I love their cold veggie sub but the one that keeps me coming at night is their Italian Special.  I just don't want it to end.  I get it on their Italian bread and they have little containers with vinegar and oil off the to side that I shake up and drizzle on.  Give it a try if you are in a rush and wanting a tasty satisfying sub.
2	5PXEcjDMBigxuzlGDO55nQ	I know I said I hate "chain" restaurants...but honestly I really do.    We were looking for a reverse happy hour and this was close by so we gave in.  The beer was cold, but our food took FOREVER...literally!  Then, they cooked my steak incorrectly...instead medium rare it came out super over done...I asked for a baked potato and got mashed.  I can say that the bartender (we sat at the bar), noticed immediately and sent it back and had it taken off of our bill.  So the two stars is for the food and for the slow service of the kitchen...I'd give more for the attentiveness of the bartender and the manager!
4	7JGCLABB5M8b9xOtURunFQ	For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant, this place is as good as it gets. There's nothing like a 3 am burrito or huevos rancheros after a long bike ride down mill. The night time crowd will probably consist of late night weirdos (I myself could be included) and the obnoxious children let out of yucca tap room. It also helps that it's basically across the street from where I often reside.I usually get a burrito with random veggie ingredients or a breakfast burrito and a horchata. There's HUGE portions, cheap prices, and their salsa is tasty too. I believe it's usually cooked to order and they are happy to deal with my picky, custom order. This definitely is gluttonous though so don't expect to feel sexy after eating.
2	pDPpsrOrOtZP8kmoGkGv5w	I was hesitant to come here, but it is super close to my fiance's work so we decided to go. I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos. They were really salty and just... well, not good. My salad was fine, but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side, and instead it was slathered everywhere. We also split a burger, which was decent, but very very heavy. I think I maybe had 3 bites of it. My partner also ordered a drink special- a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue! They said it was the "Illini" special, though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green... Bottom Line: Save your money and support a local restaurant instead!
2	b8qQb80OnF8FCpMBDbhsg	Love going here late at night. But the most recent visit was thw night before Halloween. And around 3 am the place was full of drunk college kids. The table behind me actually puked on their table and ran out of the restaurant. Employees left it there for about 10 minutes before cleaning it up. The smell and the visual spoiled the majority of my party's appetite. Service slow usually and eggs always underdone. But a reliable late night breakfast.
4	k6JGo0sIzCNGePnAd1HqQ	So, very hot day in vegas... well, compared to Mountain View, CA that is... I had some scrap steel I wanted to sell, and had just carried a load to my local recycler... and  I was thirsty.... My wife and I decided to swing by McD to get our favorite Wild Berry Smoothie and went to the drive thru.  The drive thru at this McD is unusual in that there is actually a live person at a window (they have 3 windows, one to order, one to pay, and one to get food) taking orders. Before I said anything, he's like, "would you like to try our new mango pineapple smoothie?"... I said, "well, I was going to order our favorite, wild berry smoothie.." He says, "the Mango Pinapple is much better.... you can put Baccari's in there and it would make a great frozen drink too"  Sold!  It was good! The syrupy sweetness of mango with the sweet tang of pineapple was very refreshing on this hot Vegas day... it just might become my new favorite.
2	8lekt0UxW11XyeHAe2b93g	Came here because I wanted to try something new for dinner with my folks. Since it was near school and I didn't want to drive across the city to eat, we decided to come here. There is plenty of seating, as this place doesn't get that much business (I wonder why...) and the cool thing about the seating is that for every game on the television there is a small box that can tune in so you can hear it. However, it didn't work at my table because either they didn't turn on the system or it was broken.   Let me say, this place is not somewhere to eat. It's a drinking place. That being said, I ordered the BBQ burger and it was stacked (which isn't bad). However, there's a catch to it. You would imagine, yeah burger comes with fries right? Wrong. Fries are a dollar extra on top of your $8-9 burger ($2 if you want onion rings) So, if you decide to get a burger, prepare that there will not be any sides. However, I believe that their burger is something to get and actually more than their BBQ.   My family enjoyed what they ordered, baked potato with a salad and smokehouse burgers. I don't think they had really anything special about it, except that they said it wasn't as oily as other restaurants. (But come on, it's supposed to be greasy!)  Thanks to those who reviewed here on yelp, my family and I stayed away from the brisket! And plus, I think no where can compare briskets to Mac's (check out my review on them). Until then, I'll be sure to mention it. I think my next trip for BBQ will be Mac's, but if you're in the Hilton and you're starving for BBQ you really have no other choice. Hey, at least you can walk.
2	kMvTSM8h5U0ocw88GwahA	I've eaten at this location since 1997/98, so I know what I'm talking about. First, the place is under new management and the renovations are awesome. My first visit for lunch since the changes was great. Unfortunately, I thought dinner would be the same and it was borderline terrible. My falafel was cold and one side was a cheaper substitute for the tabouleh that I'm accustomed to having. Other patrons complained that their food was cold as well (which had to be reheated). My appetizer came near the end of dinner, the baklava was ridiculously small and the pitas I purchased were completely molded 3 days later. I've been a loyal customer for more than 10 years. It will be a long, long time before I ever go back and I won't recommend my friends eating here until I see improvement.
2	AsNxK1GvUzwU1JLDoNjhvw	not impressed.  food was lacking (cheese enchilada tasted like rubber and beans were over cooked) and service was mildly attentive. with so many great mexican food places here in arizona, i am glad that i dont have to be stuck with Serrano's.
2	fFeAF9cmnXYPO6LPJAnxA	Bad service high prices. This place gets overcrowded during long weekends.  I went for a lunch buffet, had to wait 30 mins for naan.   If they want to serve lots of people during holidays they should increase their staff to provide a Better service.  Food is average, very limited options considering the price they are charging.  Only advantage they have is very few Indian places in town.
4	Ec7ukepx3PehZ6mQM8jbw	First impression, the hostess was nice, if not unprofessional looking. The manager was also extremely unprofessional looking. The restaurant was not clean, sticky tables and dirty looking floors. Our waitress was nice enough, but service was extremely slow. The plus side, the food was so good! Had southwest egg rolls, chipotle honey no less wings, and onions rings! All was so good! My husband had buffalo chicken tenders and Texas fries, he enjoyed all! The new pay at the table kiosk was neat and made leaving quicker and easier! Overall, good experience.
2	hF71z8QNjh4xzIHqXEUw	I had a chicken chimichanga because it was their $5 lunch special. In retrospect, I should have ordered something else that would have challenged the place more. At this point, I feel like I've visited my fair share of -ertos restaurants in Phoenix, and I should have known better to get chicken + tortilla + sauce + sour cream + token cabbage instead of something more complex and interesting.   There is no reason to go to Nico's when there is a Filiberto's down the street. I might consider going back if I was trapped on the corner of Southern and McClintock, starving, and if I had eaten at that little deli place next to Sunflower Market every day for a year, and I was allergic to Long John Silver's.  It's not that bad, just nothing special. And no salsa bar!
2	7DelOvcAaPrPeUXItCw	I know this place has been around forever and is well established in the Valley. But I think its about time for some CPR! Everything about this place inside and out screams old school...all the way down to the service staff's uniforms! Ummmm...has anyone else noticed that this place used to be their parent's old stomping grounds? That's cool but how but making it inviting for the 30-40 yr old crowd?   I had prime rib that was barely warm and I swear had the flavor of a dry piece of toast! The most bland Prime I've ever had. The "fresh" horseradish I requested on the side was even bland. My friend had the buffalo meatloaf (half buffalo/half ground sirloin). Now that my Dear Reader was a home run! Tender and full of flavor!  The ribs were decent and the "baseball" fillet was par at best also.   We went on a Friday night and were 4 of perhaps 20 other people in this huge place! The website reads like its scrumptous. When in fact, the experience was more like waiting in line at the new hot club only to find no one inside!   Oh....the only redemption was the desert. Pecan pie and their citrus creme brulee....Both make you rub your belly!!!  Bon Appetite!
4	b32KXupFP63pgk2Ik8meJg	I've been  back to China King a couple of times now since my initial visit.  I came earlier around 11 to 11:30 is and it was not busy at all.  I ordered off their specials menu, Spicy Pork & the next visit Sa Cha Chicken, $5.99 for entree, rice & choice of egg roll or chicken wing.  Both were pretty good.  Again nothing outstanding, but pretty tasty.  I order a chicken wing as side both times to try them out.  The flavor is excellent, but again they were a little soggy from being left on their steam table for a while.  I also had soup on both visits since it is getting colder out now.  Egg drop the first time, then hot & sour the second.  Both soups were pretty good and you can get some crunchy noodles to go with it.    Since I keep returning I'm upping my rating to 4 stars.  This place is kind of growing on me and the food has been consistently hot and flavorful on each of my visits.  Don't expect anything fancy here, but they do have pretty good Chinese food here.
2	ykY04e9o4eqJU7mfYNEiA	Pricing: Good-Expensive. The sandwich isn't pricey, but the combo options were. Quality: Poor. Blandest thing I have ever eaten. Turnaround: Poor-Good. Came right before closing, but still this is suppose to be fast food. Service: Good. No attitude and provided everything I needed.  Sadly, this is one of the few places that I have nothing good to really say about them. Their pricing was not comparable to anything I have had before and bordered on being way too expensive for a simple meal. Why would anyone pay $3 for a measly side of fries? The worst was the food. I never knew beef mixed with onions and peppers can be so devoid of flavors like this sandwich was. I am actually amazed, but since I had paid for this meal, I feel cheated instead. The meat, although tender, had no taste to them and I would have doubt I was even eating beef if I had not known I ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Moreover, the sandwich was dry, even with all the onions and peppers that would normally be oozing juices. The cheese was also strangely nonexistent so the sandwich was really just a bunch of beef sitting around doing nothing. The turnaround was also pretty sad. This is suppose to be fast-paced eatery in the middle of a food court and given that the items are either grilled or fried, I expected speedier service. In addition,  I was the last customer before they closed with not another soul in sight so I had no idea of what the holdup could even be.
4	BesjaJyHuPXDMYn7nW3w	I love this place, great custard, sandwiches, and soups. I fiftys diner feel inside this small little custard shop has big taste. Dont eat dinner before you come here for desert. There sandwiches are top notch. The freshest bread you can get. Their pepper relish could be the best thing you can add to a great sandwich. Then to follow it with frozen custard which will make you forget about ice cream or frozen yogurt. Must try in my book. Heaven is a hide away on baseline.
4	tO2GUuLkAHQyuXFXeIm9aQ	Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Was relatively crowded, but I was able to order quickly with my food coming out a few minutes later.    I ordered the Chicago Dog all the way and a brat.    The relish was bright green, so I was a little taken aback by it.  I gave it a shot, but it ultimately was not my taste, so it was banished to the serving container....  The remainder of the hot dog was really good though.   The brat - Nothing to write home about.  It was OK.  Not as good as a beer brat from home.  I would skip that one and just get 2 Chicago Dogs instead.  If you're looking for a hot dog in Chicago, Matt's is the place to get it!
4	eTI2di6bcXKCC1qSMBMNw	I really enjoyed the service. One of my favorite things to eat is enchiladas. But here, they're inconsistent. Last time was amazing. This time,the sauce tasted burnt, Which is typically how the sauce tastes to me.but I'm not just writing this review based on my experience, my daughter absolutely loves this place.
4	fx9C0pmZmx8Z90RA70Qg	We prefer Pizza A Metro now. Tastes great and catches you way off guard. But we'll return on occasion to Slice of Sicily. They still have a fun place and solid food. They know our neighborhood, too, so if you want to keep it local, keep going to Slice of Sicily.
4	oTmR5tUQxy69sGlUbrA5w	I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.  Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.  When I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash!
4	TyVaDJMylhPlOwGAfhyyQ	Piping hot and on time delivery.  I'm usually not a fan of take-out because I don't like lukewarm or cold food, but this place did not disappoint.  I literally had to blow on my fried rice it was so hot!  We ordered the Beef and Broccoli main course, with a side of Chicken Fried Rice, and potstickers.  The total was $33 (not including tip) which I thought was very reasonable since the portions are huge!!  It is at least 2 meals for my husband and I.  The potstickers tasted really good as well as the sauce that comes with them.   I typically like my potstickers more crispy, and these were softer but still awesome.  Some places just cook them differently!  The fried rice portion has a ton of egg and white chicken which I loved.  The beef & broccoli and was also very good, pretty typical chinese food, nothing crazy different or out of the ordinary.   We were quoted 35 minutes over the phone and it came pretty much right on time.   Will definitely do their takeout again!
4	ztyoiaiEkcLsGc9ciDIQYQ	Went here several times on a short trip to Vegas to visit my dad for Thanksgiving.   The two bartenders we met here -- Karen and Robert -- are the type of naturally friendly and attentive people that you just don't encounter frequently enough in the service industry. They make this place what it is.  My wife is what you might call a mashed potato aficionado, and she loves the mashed potatoes here. She also enjoys the little wooden trays that fit over the bar so you can still eat and play a machine, if you so desire.  Speaking of the machines, they let us play for a decent amount of time on our first couple of visits (and even win a little on our second visit), but then they turned nasty on our third visit -- even the Harry Potter pinball machine chewed me up and spit me out that day!   So, play the machines at your own peril, but either way, you will enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and good food!
2	6EDe2PXH9RQSauTF0G0i9Q	I seem to be going against the crowd here, but I found their pizza to be on the flavorless side.  I've had it a few times, trying different kinds hoping for better results.  I haven't tried their hoagies, maybe they're better.
4	A4A03K22YygVRcBgK6ZuBQ	I had breakfast here this morning, while waiting for Firestone to change my oil and rotate my tires.  I was so happy that it was within very short walking distance from the tire place, saving me from a fast-food breakfast. I did the gyro omelette with hash browns and a biscuit.   The food was great, the service was great, and the diner ambiance in this place is great!  It wasn't very crowded; I was surprised at how quiet this place was.  I had a great experience, and I'll definitely be back.
2	h0NU2EgWijXdHXTHLBCILA	This first paragraph is a 1 to 2 starness...... Well for starters they had empty trays, and the empty trays were the hottest ones that is there was steam coming off of them. In other words most of the food was cold. This place must've been severely understaffed because they didn't get the plates off our table till long after we'd gotten another. They were letting the food trays run empty for 10 and 15 minutes at a time.  This second paragraph is the 3 to 4 starness...... the food may have been cold but some of it was very good, in that the spicing was done correctly. Often Chinese buffets spicy dishes are not quite as spicy as they need to be in my book to be called spicy. The price was good and the drink was included but that's not enough to make up for all the inequities. It was pretty much unanimous at the time we left our little UYE Rand H. Mike C. Robyn N and myself all agreed and said in the parking lot as we left two stars. Rand H. upon further contemplation came to one star. And only because some of the food was fairly good did I stay at two stars. I hope they get it right, but I won't be going back there anytime soon.
4	Rh0FUMWGHMLbZbzm7ANA	Very reasonable daily specials, and large portions, of tasty fresh prepared food.  Not the most gourmet experience out there, but a fantastic value, and reliable consistent experience without a long wait.  I particularly recommend the grilled chicken salad (Bangin' homemade greek and ranch dressing) and gyro's.
2	8M0qKyRDFcyFhW6IJ1hqww	Bagels are good. Waited about 5 minutes before they started my cappuccino. 10 minutes after that when it was still an empty cup I told them nevermind and left. This location seems to do an ok job with 3 or fewer people in line. The one at Desert Ridge does better with rushes .
2	blXAfvLNBHrAA1oRfV57GA	While my drink was delicious, I waited in the drive thru for at least 15 minutes when there was only one car ahead of me.  I expected the car in front to have an order of 10 bags or so, but it appeared all they ordered were 2 drinks and a shake! What can possibly take so long?
4	Rh17VoWPHzfcmftK8opw	While I absolutely hate going here, it's dirty, noisy and full of kids, my sweet pea loves it so we had his last two birthday parties here.  They took good care of us and were in charge so I didn't have to heard kids around.  I just wish the place weren't so dirty.
2	03zi41xV7JbBGXuComxdQ	Shame on me for not consulting Yelp prior to going here but I was uptown with my 6 y/o and she was in charge of finding somewhere to eat and chose this spot.    The service was fine, place was empty because it was early so if the service had been bad I would have been even less impressed.  The kids menu was quite pathetic AND expensive!  $6.00 for two small hamburgers? And when I say small I'm talking like half dollar size burgers...thus the reason we followed up dinner at TCBY (silver lining :)!)  I had the Thai beef salad and it had about 6 strips of beef.  Definition of strip = about 3 inches long and 1/4 inch wide...again pathetic.  Flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else.  My advice....avoid it and keep it movin!
2	nuNejMOa5MvPIRdisq40lQ	It breaks my heart to write this but this summer my favorite Chinese hole in the wall for the past 13 years has been sold and after giving it 3 tries I have to say it's just not the same.  Not even close.   We have tried all about old favs and they are only half as good as prior.  Soooo bummed!    If you know of any place I should go between Waxhaw and Matthews please let me know.
4	6Pw3ZFnBqtQUXsAFZrfg	I was surprised by all the mediocre reviews here. I've always thought the food was excellent.  The service is nothing to write home about, and even with a reservation I've ended up waiting 10 or 15 minutes.
2	SrbjsRDwEZ2AOZJhQCyug	At this Taco Bell it takes two people to mop the floor. One to mop and the other to watch; she must be training. In general, I avoid this one because the kids that work here spend more time socializing with each other than paying attention to the job they are getting paid for.
4	m2M7qnEDOTHPrTADdFDhQ	My Husband and I had lunch today at Federicos, he loves their Fish burritos, they are huge  !  we live in scottsdale, but visit this mexican restaurant often, so worth the drive!   they also have good green chile !  they make their beans with soy, so they do  taste a little different !! this place is very clean also !!   good food ! good prices !
2	x6y72PxZhKUTWkh76PeWw	So I drive by this place a few times a week, and after seeing their cheesy commercials I've decided to give this place a try. I would not recommend their pizza at all. I had the California Pizza which includes your typical pizza veggies, and I have to say...NO FLAVOR at ALL!!! Even with added salt and pepper..no flavor!!! This was the first time coming here after being in AZ for 2 years...and will be my LAST!!!
2	Rnmp3WNdBbqE3M5K4KHacQ	I used to come to this Sonic quite a bit, but they seemed to get slower each visit.  I hadn't been to this location for quite a while; not since my last drive-thru nightmare here (look under the tips).  I was in the area tonight and craving a pineapple malt, so I thought I'd give them another shot... Waited  in the drive-thru line 10 minutes without moving, and fled  - If you want Sonic in this area, save yourself time and drive to the one on Pecos and Flamingo... I guarantee the drive will still be shorter than the wait here.  I give it two stars, only because the food and malts are excellent here, once you finally get them; and the staff is usually pretty pleasant.
4	mbtnCuUIo615T1YQfUIv7g	I decided to write this really quickly while I was still full from the deliciousness that is the Tasty Turkey.   My sis used to work for Bruegger's Bagels back in the day and brought me home millions of bagels... this is how my obsession began (thanks for that Christine - probably has lead to my wheat allergy...)   Anyway, the sandwich is served on an Asiago cheese bagel, I prefer the garlic one... tastes better with the chive cream cheese. Add cucumber, tomato, sprouts and of course turkey and you have yourself one tasty sammie.   I only give 4 stars, 5 if my pickle wasn't always so shriveled. Also, 5 if you weren't so darn expensive. And, 5 if you were open past 4pm, some of us want to eat you for dinner!
2	Sff9V82MCD2zjyNTYaYMg	I'm not sure how a buffet could have cold, overcooked food at opening time, but it did. The rampant, morbid obesity, and the emphasis on deep fried, fatty, flavorless, foods should have clued me in. Hey, it is cheap and you will get what you paid for.  Stay away. There are several restaurants nearby that are inexpensive and worth it.
2	jz9g9jbEjQ36fxQkHxc1oQ	Carne asada is alright, but you've gotta put more effort into your food than handfuls of shredded cheese on most menu items. On my second visit, I opted for the green chile burrito...the tortilla was nothing special, and the chile was bland. You call THAT a green sauce?  As the green, gravy like mixture spilled everywhere, I tried to enjoy it with some tortilla chips. Their chips aren't anything special either. I like the salsa bar and the atmosphere, but when it comes to a quick Mexican dining experience, I know you can do tons better. I don't hate this place, but the bar is set higher in the desert.
4	SHUSnMzyfwiehipCRkwciw	Great Chinese food.  Costs a bit more but it's worth it in my opinion.  For instance, I had shrimp lo mein.  It was a large portion , the shrimp were abundant, large and devained.  Now I only know of one other place that does that and it's a whole bunch more there (P.F. Chang's).
2	FDzVH7QM3ZQjUf7TKUafWw	This burger king is rude. Going through the drive-thru hasn't been the best. Every single time whether it's 1 item or 5 items the person wants you to pull ahead. Your waiting and waiting, watching car after car. I mean sometimes for just a whopper jr. But then FINALLY they remember your out there. When you do get your food it's ice cold and get this... the order isn't right!   This location got a face lift to match the others. It is clean. Just details about food quality and service.
4	X1a5O0Yd2paR6j5jJdeSg	Gah! Wish u weren't so far away.   We were down in Urbana for my brother's gradation and came to breakfast before the big event.   I had never been to Cracker Barrel before but after this experience, I will definitely be back. The food was delicious. I loved the baked apples.  The coffee cup was kept full. I love the idea of the little peg game on the table to play while you wait.   The waitress was so sweet and offered me a cup of coffee to go.   Super nice staff throughout.
2	2y4vYx8SFuLnRzgB8SrA	With all of the pizza choices in the area, I can't understand why someone would choose Slices.  They serve a huge variety of different pizzas, but they are all sitting out cold, so every time you order a slice, you are getting what amounts to pizza leftovers.  You know, the pizza that is still in your fridge from the night before?  Good, but not as good as when it was fresh.  I don't get the crust.  It is similar to the crust used at Peter Piper Pizza from childhood.  Tasteless and gritty from the corn meal, and dry from sitting out in the open air.  I know there are a lot of differing opinions regarding pizza crust, but if you are in the camp that actually eats the crust, this is not the place for you.  For what you get, it seems a little over priced.  You can also order a whole pie fresh, but it seems a tad expensive for the quality.  I'd rather drive 2 miles to Southern and Mill for Venezia's Pizza.  Hell, take the bus to Venezias.  The 66 goes straight there from Slices.
4	8yMBnCtdSkAMGQQVYjwUwA	I went here on Saturday for the Kentucky Derby with a party of 4.  I knew it was going to be packed so I went in and reserved a table a few days prior.  It was $20 to reserve a table but that money goes toward your tab.  The place is pretty sketchy and I was expecting them to "lose" the money and/or my "reservation", but to my amazement they indeed had a nice table with my name on it when I arrived on Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty busy so service wasn't exactly speedy gonzales, but it was very good considering the crowd.  Our drink orders came pretty quickly as did our food.  I had a burger and fries and it was good.  Typical bar food that was probably frozen at some point but it was pretty good nonetheless.  The prices on food/drinks are very reasonable as well.  I was surprised they didn't jack up all their prices because of the occasion.  They have a ton of TVs and plenty of tables/seating.  The entire place could use some updating but I guess that is all part of the charm of a sketchy off track betting place in Tempe.  Anyway, I had fun and the entire crowd as well as the entire staff of the place was very friendly.  I would definitely return if I'm ever in the mood for some horse/dog betting action.
2	tf70um7nolulpgVFXgNQ	I had a coupon so stopped by for lunch. It was still to expensive. I had a Turkey Club  and a double slice of Cheese Pizza. With coupon it was still almost $11 and my pizza was burnt to hell. I couldn't even eat the pizza because all of the burnt black spots just didn't look right. The turkey sub was just okay. I can get a bigger sub from Subway that tastes better. With the right coupon I do like certain things here but they aren't consistent as far as the taste and quality of the food. There is a drive thru or you can eat inside and get free bread sticks.
2	nWnCf190KZjFmBO0bLCFgg	Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.    The food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.  This last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!  What really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere.

Situated in the courtyard of the office tower in which I work, BF is a convenient lunch option when I've forgotten my lunch in the fridge at home. I enjoy the freshness of their food and that it's made to order, and that the workers seem to be constantly cleaning. The salsa bar is always well-stocked and offers a good selection. Today I ordered the Nacho Burrito, enchilada style, and found it quite tasty.   It won't knock your socks off, but it's a fairly-priced meal downtown that remains consistent. If you go, stop by my office and we'll dine together.
4	vPMWBQtsS8e88VoEZ8EuA	In some cities (Detroit for example), Olive Garden is the place you go once a year for something really special--wearing your Sunday best.  In Charlotte, Olive Garden is the place you go when you want some fairly good italian food--wearing your shorts and t-shirt.  The Zuppa Tuscana (soup) is really good.  The alfredo sauce is pretty good too.  One thing you must try (if you are of age) is the Sangria.  Excellent.
4	q9bnhmmYjPbFaoGDrlERg	Filiberto's is a unique place that can't be compared very well.  The previous review said it was in between Taco Bell and Del Taco.  I disagree.  I think it is more between Taco Bell and a sit down Mexican restaurant.  The food is very authentic and isn't the fastest fast food.  My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito, which is HUGE, and the shredded beef nachos are big enough for two.  The cost isn't fast food either.  A burrito is around $3.50 and nachos around $5.  But to compare their food to Taco Bell doesn't do it justice.  Taco Bell would be like cafeteria food and Filiberto's like a Mexican BBQ.  It is the most authentic fast food Mexican food you can find.    By the way, Filiberto's is usually in a former fast food place.  The atmosphere isn't necessarily the kind where you would want to sit down and eat.  I recommend the drive through.    I do remember the 2nd location too and the line was unlike any other I have seen for a restaurant before or since.
2	hn9hmdoBRegX6Fh0jukow	Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf.  However, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded. They Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.
4	vLVCmUpHqjkR33qtRZw	When you think of a nice Italian restaurant, you don't think it would come in a strip mall, but Mama Ricotta's bucks the trend. Not only does the atmosphere & decor give the impression of a nicer Italian place, the food is pretty good.  While you may be thinking that this is a dinner only place, this is actually a really popular lunch place. There is usually a line during lunch, but it moves pretty quickly, especially if the outside seating is open. While the food can be a tad on the pricey side, I have yet to have a meal I haven't been happy with. They have plenty of selections for all Italian lovers so don't expect just the obvious options.   I'd suggest this place as more of a dinner place, mainly because of the prices along with the portion sizes. If you lunch it here, it may be a long afternoon at work trying to stay awake. And with their wine selection, making this a date destination isn't a bad idea either.
4	eLmorIxW1Z66TzxhKdKQ	This place has a great variety of food! Go here for lunch! The portion is bigger and it's cheaper. You get a salad and a small appetizer with your entree during lunch, but you have to pay for it during dinner. The naan here is absolutely to die for. the only complaint i have about this restaurant is that you will walk out of there smelling like the food. The odor is not the most pleasant so I wouldn't suggest wearing your sunday best.
2	YkM9YpKwmN0oU3mWiptp1w	I really wasn't that impressed.  Plastic table cloth and the place smelled kind funky too.  I got the bone in ribeye - and it definetely wasn't the best steak in the area.  Wine selection is rather lacking.  I'd hit the many alternatives before this; Flemings, Capital, Ruth...
4	pWDK4ZhXaqoJJD7GwRyp3A	Would have been 5 stars w/ better pricing BUT what KILLER PIZZA!!! I cannot put into words how good it was and I am mad at myself for living here for decades and just now discovering them! We will be ordering again!!!
4	cqBDlttwsMm2yLsL2QBBjA	It's been over 2 yrs since my original review, time to update it....this place has been a solid, consistent restaurant since I moved to town a few yrs ago.    They should be recognized for their consistent delivery of good food and solid service.  Their employees are always friendly and welcoming.  It can get busy here for lunch and on the weekends....the one knock on it is the small parking lot area...it can get full fast.  I'm addicted to their Steak Burritos....especially when I top it with Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.  Return Factor - 100%
4	HyXGqVdBhE2cY1EpP2jNcw	We went here for dinner this past Saturday for Restaurant week.   Its a cute little place with lots of little rooms. The decor is a little old and boring.   The food and service was pretty great.   The lack of music was deadening. There was zero atmosphere here.   The little basket of bread they brought out was decent though the mini croissants were very very chewy and a bit burnt.   I ordered the Baked brie puff pastry with fig sauce, freaken YUM!  We also ordered the beet and goat cheese salad off the regular menu to share, it was really good but the price for the portion is a total joke!   For dinner I ordered the bean ravioli, it was just ok.   For dessert I got the flourless chocolate cake, it was really dry, not sure if that's how its supposed to be. The husband ordered the pecan pie, I snuck a bite and it was amazing!   We had a really great time but I wasn't floored or wowed and glad I didn't have to pay the regular prices as they were very high.
4	1R5SRY7ONrNU79TDGJqGlA	This restaurant is a local mom and pop with good 'ol home cooking.  I ordered the eggs nova scotia which was filling.  The combination of eggs, salmon, cream cheese, and dill was great in this dish.  The "everything" bagel was fresh and when I asked for extra cream cheese the serving was enough to lay on a thick coat.  I've also had one of their gigantic sandwiches and the pickled tomato was tasteful.
4	lpvOxxBuD7cRcO57utVTDw	Don't really go to these types of bars a lot (a handful of times), but this was a very enjoyable evening.  Don't line dance, but my wife got out there and kicked up her heels a bit.  The food is good, the atmosphere friendly, and the crowd was great.  If you are into C&W, this is very good place to go.
4	MbbevCd1YzQFb5GEThNfDQ	I eat lots of sub sandwiches but I usually opt for the more famous chain which will remain nameless but it starts with Sub and ends it Way (and the word is subway) which happens to be about a block down the street.   How foolish of me to go to a chain when Sub Factory is right in my neighborhood.   The subs are 10'' on white or wheat with a large selection, most subs starting at only 4.89! That's a good deal! I had the steak and cheese which was loaded with peppers, grilled onions and lots of meat.   Pictures of "old" Tempe (i.e. probably from the 80s and 90s) hung on the wall. There are a few ways to my heart and an appreciation of local history is one of them. So are good sub sandwiches. I'm now in love with Sub Factory and I'm going to go there a lot more.   The girl working was very nice and genuinely smiled and thanked me when I left.   So this is a major win and a great new discovery for me.
4	tt03cawHs06BosH1JgX2PA	"Who Yelps about a Blimpie", right? This guy. This location of a moderately big chain of shops is awesome. The staff is super friendly. I'm sure that the sandwich making itself is standardized but I've been to several other Blimpies and subs just taste better here. Even other patrons here seem magically friendly. I don't get it but it's true. My office lunch crew thinks the same.   Between injury and vacation, I have not been here in awhile. I will certainly have to remedy that. A Club w/all the veggies, a New Times and chit-chat with pals sounds good.  Oh.  Map to the right is wrong, btw.  The shop is on the NW corner of Via De Ventura and Hayden.  ^_-  Update: So I went today.  It was great!  What is it with this place?!  The sandwich was yummy.  The people behind the counter were friendly.  Everyone in the looong line seemed so pleasant.  Like they knew the secret too.  The young boy and husband of the young lady behind the register came in.  Heck, even the kid was really cute and the husband seemed like a good guy.  Is this place on a ley line or something?  How does this insta-sub shop do it?!
2	ikvm42dGopC1oplb3FIazg	It was alright, but if I'm driving that far I'm going to Maggiano's. The aroma that you smell when you walk in gets you excited about their food. However it doesn't WOW you or anything. Service was good and attentive.
2	krmla9gLIvDotXChMOANKw	An interesting venue - definitely mixed feelings re. this review - take it with a grain of salt if you want to visit, but otherwise, consider other options if you have them.  Joan and I were visiting her sister in Phoenix, and, to be honest, we had no idea where to go and consulted Yelp.  This place came up first for breakfast in the rankings, and I'm not surprised.  I don't know much about Phoenix, but relative to my standards of NY/LA, there's not much there.  We were very happy to drive up to the farm, park, and sit down at a very nice table in a beautiful, popular, semi-rustic setting.  The weather was perfect and the atmosphere delightful.    Service was also great to start, coffee was self-serve and tasty too  ...... if only the food had been good as well.  I hate to give two stars, but Joan's frittatta was straight-up cold and rubbery.  Doesn't get much worse than that - the waitstaff warned us that it was 'served at room temperature,' but seemed like that was all-too-subtle code for 'just don't order this - it's bad.'  Wish they had just said that.  I had Eggs Benedict and it was so-so OK, but not good enough to balance it all out.  In the end, the waitstaff switched through shifts too and they messed up the bill, so that didn't help either.  But more than anything it was the mediocre food that earned the two stars here - I hope they improve it, as the setting was delightful, but until they do I can't recommend the place.    (As an alternative, though...what else, exactly, is in Phoenix?)
2	P5gqBU9S4GmgnlhatlDwLA	I'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.  Boston Market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the Internet, the order is sent to the store that you select and you just go and pick it up.  Humph, that's where the happiness stops.  Just because you send your order in and are given a time for pick up does not mean that your order will be ready.  Also be sure to print out your "invoice" prior to going or they will literally argue with you that you order is complete.  Out of five orders, only two were done correctly.  So that meant the estimated twenty minutes on the "invoice" actually turned into about 45 minutes.  Would have been easier to drive here, walk into the store and wait for the order to be done.  And prices weren't really that great.  Food not as good either, the meatloaf I ordered has several pieces of gristle in it.  And if I hadn't asked for gravy to put on it, it would have been dry beyond believe.  As the stars say, "Meh.  I've experienced better."
2	KtNISFnBMjNbDPYIbmVT0g	Having a ying for a taste of Switzerland.. I decide to celebrate a special persons birthday here.. Kind of to remind her of Europe.. well.. the price reminded me of Switzerland.. but the authenticity isnt there.. AND they have a menu that says a Alpine Nite.. dont be fooled.. most cheese fondues do not have grainy mustard in them.. We did the price fix menu.. starting with the cheese fondue.. a salad.. the meat and seafood course.. (a small amount for two considering the price was about $45 each).. chocolate fondue.. with too much amaretto in the chocolate.. the experience is cool.. but if youve been to Switzerland.. dont go in here thinking your getting authentic.. my advice.. hit up Sur La Table and get your own fondue pot.. do it at home.. and youll get more authentic.. am I snob.. proudly..
4	kPlw8hjcMkh70MZY1MMHw	had a saturday morning brunch there with my kids who got to watch the planes take off and land. it is a neat novelty and the food is good, but not great. service also good but not great. Interesting spot worth trying, but not sure it's worth revisiting.
4	GaeExsMJLn4oxSDqKosuQ	The chocolate covered strawberry bowl was very good. However when you ask what is in the different blizzards, no one seems to know and they have to go get a list. They did find out for me however and were pleasant about it. Always very good, prices similar to other places.
2	Zq7ICldpdonw2uNpE7uIw	I mean, it's Taco Bell. Not much to say. This building is very outdated, definitely needs an update. The food is alright, I haven't had any issues with the ordering. They aren't very busy though, so I think the workers could be nicer.
4	PPEw5F66bVfFTeObFA5aeA	I know, I know...shame on me for eating at a chain restaurant...BUT, I like the options that they have on the menu and I generally like the quality of the food and flavor, plus the portions are large.  It was fairly busy when we arrived.  We had to wait maybe 8 minutes for a table, so in the mean time we went to the bar and ordered a drink.  Gin and tonic with lime for me, fat tire for the fiance.  Nothing fancy, nothing to get hyped up about.  We were seated in an odd little corner in the back of the restaurant.  It was cozy with the exception of the loud and annoying kid sitting next to me, who clearly had a mild (or extreme) form of ADD.  The parents were doing nothing to prevent the kid from going crazy...but, this forum is not for talk on parenting, so all things aside, let's talk about the food.  Our waiter was AWESOME!  His name was Mathew, early 20's (if that), skinny and frail, but overall a bright burst of energy and enthusiasm about his job and serving us.  WAY TO GO.  He had a cute goofy laugh and made the special sound tasty, though it was not what I came to eat.  He was prompt to deliver us our water, bread, and come back to take our order.  My fiance ordered the farmhouse burger (burger, pork belly, egg, all the fixins) and I had the farfalle garlic chicken pasta (which came with peas, cream sauce, garlic, tomato, shrooms, etc.).    When the food finally did arrive, I was greeted with something that clearly was NOT my order.  It was a pasta dish, except it had shrimp and spaghetti, instead of bowtie pasta and chicken.  I kindly told the girl this wasn't what I ordered and she graciously brought me back the correct item.  Apparently, she got them mixed up.  I ate only two bites before I realized that almost half of the ingredients were missing from my dish.  Mathew came back, I advised him of the issue, and he HAPPILY took the plate back.  I was expecting to see the same food I just snacked on with a splash of peas added.  WRONG.  He brought me back a whole BRAND NEW dish!  Fresher tasting than the last!  Exciting!  He made sure to hook me up on the extra parm cheese too!  In either case, I gave this experience 4 stars.  I know that there were some issues that took place, but the way that it was handled and amended really stood out in my mind as excellent.  I genuinely have great experiences when I come here.
4	shoqrCIQyYl7zIkTQ1MV2Q	Definitely good when you're in the mood for a carb-overload at good price. The breadsticks are unlimited when you dine-in (idk if that's a good thing...we went overboard). The staff was very friendly.   All in all...an excellent fast food meal, without the fast food feeling.
2	ZCjDFUhaDWfq5SIdqoZBA	Second visit,both with similar results.Latest following a Packer game with late NFL games on TV.. This sports bar had a rugby REPLAY on with volume. When asked for NFL was seemingly a bother to bartender,not to mention taking  beer order too! Other places in Verona with better more friendly service..Will be my last visit.
2	iVlPX03GL0YRAQ8ZPyxmA	Snack bar quality! According to one in our party, the chicken was as good as the other review states. Carnitas good as well. Fish tacos...DRENCHED in grease...yuck!...heartburn. Nachos were okay, if you like cheese whiz. Typical glorified frozen food. Yuck!
2	IEVJSIn1gnYf0fOBd0TG8Q	I went twice to this place. To be honest, I decided not to give it a shot after the first time, but I said it might be a bad first experience. We were a big party the first time so I almost tried most of their starters and some of their main dishes. I did not like how they serve the hummus, tabouli, main dishes, and everything else in very small quantities (unsatisfying at all).  Here are my ratings : Place & Decor: Below Average Food: Below average Service: Average Prices: below average ($$ for few food)
2	Brv0SvGp3xeKe0RjodlnQ	In the (relatively) new Lowe's Foods shopping center, in the rapidly developing area near Highway 51 and Lawyers Road where they're buliding lots of new houses, this restaurant sure is postioned well.  Having been open about six months, we decided it was worth a visit.  The place is nice, as long as you don't look at the carpet.  Seeing as the whole center isn't that old, it's amazing to see carpet that looks about 10 years old.  No telling how that happened.  That said, the food is what we were after, not the carpet, and that didn't disappoint.  Quickly served tempura appetizer was good, although a bit heavy on the batter, and not as light as most tempura dishes.  Instead of having smallish veggies, it was chunky style, which was odd, although not entirely bad.  Lettuce wraps were good, though I'm not sure I really like tofu, and there was plenty of it in the mixed chicken that was served with the dish.  We also had some spring rolls, but let's face it - it's tough to mess up spring rolls (or deep fried rolled anything).  We will probably go back another time for a full-fledged meal, but for a sampling of appetizers it wasn't bad at all.
4	AAKbGwbVukjvQrJchAdGg	I never write reviews. But I read some reviews here that almost scared me away from Gino's. If you love planned communities, big-box stores and chain restaurants, you will probably find something negative to say about this place, no matter what. I think I'm somewhere in the middle and can (at times) be a food snob, especially when it comes to pizza. I'm from the East coast. I can be very critical of food, in general. I don't really like chain anything. Which is why I gave it a shot, regardless of what I read. So, here's my honest opinion. First, the pizza: I ordered, Reg Crust, extra cheese, onions & bell peppers. The crust is truly super thin. (think flatbread). Everything is fresh. There is nothing wrong with the sauce or cheese. It is adequately flavorful. If you are a big sauce lover, get extra. I think it's fine. Next time I will order Thick crust and won't order extra cheese. Gino's is more than generous with their toppings. The little container of hot pepper seeds were actually Hot! Nice switch from the usually tasteless packets most places give you (mouth still burning, yay!) It's not the prettiest pizza you'll ever eat, but who cares? I don't like the way they cut it (in squares). I will also request that they cut it like a pizza, next time. Second, the location: personally, I like the flavor of So Pho, and so do they. No apologies here. I got the feeling that they embraced diversity and are a little "edgy". Yes, they do have old school pinball machines. Cute. Plenty of seating. Clean and comfortable. Service: Outstanding. Super pleasant. Owner on premises. Friendly and helpful people. This is a family business. I love that. All in All, YES, I will go to Gino's again. Next time, thick crust and cut like a pizza. I'm happy.
2	15Ss6pFWHP1TLqhISFqbSw	Stopped here the other night for a quick late night dinner to share with my boyfriend. I got the philly cheese steaks with grilled onions, plus tomato and lettuce- which was 6.99 a sandwich. Each was a very light, fluffy, toasted roll filled with lots of cheese plus grilled beef and onions with a few slices of tomato and leaves of romaine. Not an extraordinary sandwich but an easy solution after a late work night. They offer chicken wings, fingers, salads, warm and cold sandwiches, pizza and different pastas. Reminds me of you standard neighborhood pizza joint.   Pro: Open late, if not 24 hours! Yay for people who work late for me having yet another option for food.  Con: Food seems overpriced for what it is. Not a sit-down restaurant,  the decor is more suited to waiting for a quick pizza to go.   Once I try the pizza I'll give it a more in depth review, but so far I'm not planning a return trip any time soon. It filled my belly but wasn't crave worthy for me.
4	hiSRNbDdzk0oSpn6wue8g	What can you say... It's Applebees. If you don't set your expectations too high you probably won't be disappointed. The service during my visit was prompt and pleasant. The cheeseburger sliders were good; they were no White Castle but then, nothing is. All in all, nothing to complain about.
4	2QmBE8OOIg9m2iMWj0RXug	We haven't been to the EB for some time. Found out that they NOW take reservations. The place was hopping and we noticed that there were a lot of senior diners. I'm not knocking them...'cause I have my "senior discount card".  Both of the women in my life ordered the wedge salad. It looked like half of the head of lettuce. I ate my wife's half and it was crisp and cold with ranch dressing and a sprinkle of bacon bits....I forgot to finish this and can't remember what I had...so much for us seniors.
2	LiPKFrDbOylhR6UYvNqSHA	Food was great. Service sucked. Waitress forgot about us and we had to wave down another one for a to-go order which should have been placed a long time ago. Now we have to wait for 4 orders to be filled before ours and we have been sitting here done with our meal for 20 minutes. Oh and they forgot about our bread which is supposed to be included with our meal. All we got was "sorry".
2	YeNoDn7TbTSSN63vIN4VwA	my job forced me to spend 3 long summer days in Phoenix---i found this place while driving with a co-worker hungry, without any idea where we were going to eat----she was Lebonese, so she was fired up to eat here-  I ordered the Falaffel meal with a side of basmati----the place was empty on a Tuesday at 7pm----to the servers credit, she suggested I order another combination which came with basmati which saved me a few bucks----  the salad came first----i ordered it with the taziki---very plain, bland and un-inspiring----chopped basic iceberg---( i am a fan of iceberg), even being a fan of iceberg, this salad was just plain--blah---came with a sliced tomato, 2 olives, some finely cubed onions---I really saw no reason to finish the salad after a few bites.  my dish came, the falaffel were Ok, the rice was ok, but what became clear after the first tasty few bites was that everything was overally salty----way too salty to the point where I could not finish my entire place----those who know me, know I can finish whatever is placed in front of me and more---  my co-worker said she liked her dinner which was a chicken kabob and a meat kabob-she felt the chicken was the better of the two and used different spices than which she was accostomed to  not sure if I ever would retun-----
4	4oqjurd6tw55aVkwkNhOxQ	My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas. We ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.
2	6VSroByCDTSY2octFj07Q	The hostess sat us at a table that is designed to expand to the table adjacent to us for larger groups. We sat maybe 20 inches from total strangers with his toddler. Both were quiet but just too close. Made me uncomfortable for the whole duration. Food was quick and I'm a fan of Denny's anyhow (pancakes). The carpet was quite dirty which makes the whole place seem dirty. Just an observation
2	UQMiMF550LKZQl0S0WvPQ	It has been a couple of years since I have eaten at this location. The one North of Phoenix is much better. I adore the Soup, Salad and Bread sticks for lunch but the last couple of times I ate at the Cactus location the bread lacked garlic and was only a salt fest. I stopped eating here when they made people wait to be seated, with the restaurant only half empty at 4:45 PM. I eat out with some older individuals and this restaurant consistently made us wait when most of their seats were empty.  I have tried the spaghetti and lasagna a few times but can make better ones rather easily. Fortunately they have added back the "grilled sausage and peppers rustica dish" as it is much better than most of the other menu items.
4	3rvFpndhiitLDs98BkO7w	I admit that I came here with a coupon.  Without, it would be way out of my price range.  The food was great and I have no complaints.  When my wife salted her food and the cap came off the shaker the management replaced the entire plate and threw in a free bowl of soup while she waited for the replacement.  For going for my Birthday I got a giant fresh cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.
2	76jPu6Rf5UECIaaVvw0akQ	I have eaten their food for years now at several locations.  It usually tastes the same at all. Decent  Today, my noodles were burnt. If I were to imagine what a melted plastic fork would taste like, this would be it.  I stomached thru a few bites before doing the unthinkable.  I sent it back.  If an employee had not come by my table and asked if all was good I would have finished eating and left.  The crab rangoons were good and I really like the chai vanilla tea.   My replacement meal was of the normally expected quality.   I think today they had a bad chef.  My friend that went with me said his meal sucked too.    I will eventually eat their food again but it won't be my sugestion to go.   One possibility for the bad food could be this.  Two cops (police officers) were dining there too.  Perhaps we got their meals instead.  Many fast food places have a reputation of messing w/ cops orders.   Who has seen Super Troopers???
2	7cEBbpYIYEEtYiMgBSEUxQ	Husband and I have been here several times and while the food is ok, the slow service makes each experience worse than the one before. We have been here for 40 minutes and still waiting for our soup, there's only one other table....ridiculous...the hype of triple D will only last so long.
2	fSv5N9imamhiQGjBhKdE4g	I went to this Denny's only because it was on the way to where I was headed for the day.  It's a self standing not like the other two in the area which are in a mini-mall.  (Craig road and Anne road.)  It seemed busy but we were seated right away, which was nice.  However it pretty much went down hill from there.  I was brought the wrong drink and when I asked for it to be replaced I was given an iced tea with some kind of garbage in it.  Twice the waitress came by to ask how we were, but never stayed long enough at the table to let me answer.  That is beyond annoying, I'd rather just be ignored.  I made my husband ask the manager to take off my beverage since I never got to drink it.  He was polite enough to take off both drinks for us and apologized.  All the food was over cooked exept for the hashbrowns which were still cold, but I wasn't going to push my luck here.  Leave this place for all the truckers and go somewhere else for your Denny's fix.
2	ZewrvZ1lhLuhliH8QsQi2A	To quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at Ruth Chris's: Thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! If we had paid full price, my husband and I would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  Now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. Sadly, neither was true at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  My husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. While he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just OK. Definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  I had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. Was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? Heck no! I appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  I don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but I don't like them overly moist. McCormick and Schmick's are way too dry, but Ruth Chris's are way too moist. Blah. Also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  I can't wait to visit my parents in Maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  Our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  The $1 instant potatoes we buy at Fry's are better and have more flavor.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is 10x better than what I ate at Ruth Chris's.  Our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. The atmosphere was just OK.  We had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...WTF? And for an "upscale" restaurant, I was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! Yuck.  My husband and I said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  High prices do not equal good food.

2	viin7cqzhXdswGhZRxwb0Q	I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.  The lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.    The dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week.   I won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.  Bummer update.
4	fyXRzHyX3gF93aujUWpZLQ	While I went to ASU, I worked at the Melting Pot in this complex and would visit Zipps almost nightly after work. The staff at the time was awesome - however, with as much as we went in there, and being in the industry, they rarely helped you out on your tab. If you're not in the industry, you wouldn't understand, but for anyone that works in the biz, you know that most bartenders will slide you a few (especially if you and around 5-10 people come in nightly). Anyway, not the staffs fault, just a REALLY overwhelming ownership from what I am told.   But I still enjoyed it because the food is really good for a bar. The wings (golden) are really, really good. They do a wing night, or used to, when they were like half off. The monico foccacia is really good, too.   A great place to watch a game, shoot some pool and have a bite to eat. And you won't feel dirty after being there all day.
2	9Aex5DAD5LmdLiKJU3M8A	Let' s get one thing straight, this is not Indian food. It's Pakastani food. They threw out the word "Indian" to attract more customers however the food is very traditional Pakastani. I didn't think the food was good at all. There are better Pakastani restaurants like Tandoori Times and Tandoori Village.    The only reason this place is still in business is because it is one of the first "Indian"-Pakastani restaurants in the valley and so clueless Phoenicians had no idea what Indian food back then. If this place opened now, it would go out of business with all of the new and better restaurants in the valley.  The restaurant is clearly not for vegetarians and that is no suprise since it is a Pakastani restaurants and Pakastanis are not vegetarians unlike many Indians.  They specialize in the chicken and lamb dishes and much of their food is cooked on the bone in a traditional set up. There isn't much flare or professional chef-like appeal tot he food.  It has a very homestyle Pakastanie cuisine. As a result the food is not that spicy and doesn't pack a lot of heat but it does have flavor. Again, I'm biased because I'm not Pakastani and I prefer Indian food which is spicier and richer (greasier). However, if you are Pakastani, I think you wil enjoy this restaurant as it does have a very authentic Pak style cuisine.
4	GNfxSYSKQqNBM1skN1xA	Sea of Cortez style Mexican food. Doesn't get much better than this.  The Shrimp Cuilici (sp) is the signature dish and the item I order the most. It consists of shrimp baked in a creamy pepper sauce with a layer of cheese. It all blends together in a gooey goodness that you can spoon over tortillas.  All the seafood is awesome there, cooked in several styles. I love Mexican food and I love seafood. San Carlos Bay is the best of both worlds.
4	sqPlu0sFcryCdhu4d8tKQ	I visited this location on Mother's day and the first time thru they gave me different food than I had ordered. I ran back thru and the manager was extremely friendly and apologetic. Service was great and in the end he gave me 2 coupons and the wrong order as well. He seemed very genuine. Food tasted great!
4	ZQ4Qf1HttsHBpwfOBwBlg	Tonight, five of us went to our first First Monday seminar at the Burton Barr Central Library with fine art photographer (Roger Palmenberg) . The seminar was fun. Being able to walk to our destination...Cheuvront Restaurant & Wine Bar (I googled them) was perfect. You don't have to fight for a seat on a Monday night! The proprieter and two great guys helped us put together tables for 15 of us. Others came over that we met at the Library. We were a half hour early for the Reverse Happy Hour that starts at 9. Dang it. So my delish chocolate mint martini was $10 and not $7. The service was good. Sitting and visiting just felt comfortable.   Our group of five decided to order all five desserts so we could try everything! We ordered creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, lemon tart, pumpkin bread pudding and coconut cream pie. We all had so much fun trying so many different things, that was what made the experience fun! I told them I was going to do my first review on here and we had even more fun voting for our favorites! With 3 votes, the winner was PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING. It was heaven. With 2 votes, second place went to the coconut cream pie. The others were just ok.  But it was the combined seminar/restaurant experience with friends that made the evening unique and thus, special.
4	SkS58J6nb5mSVE8kGaIR9A	Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!
2	mrwwEnZrbTCKLnD7VKCSWg	Good selection of sandwiches.  The ice cream looked great but I didn't try it.  Husband and I both had the BLT which was good.  Nice crisp bacon on some kind of toasted egg bread.  All very reasonable priced.  The only reason for the two stars is that we both had some tummy issues about an hour or so later and that was the last thing we ate.  If it wasn't for that I would give another star.  I could be encouraged to give this place another go though and hope that it's a one off just because the food tasted so good.
4	wfXVCmDn9gKqUYnmC1AQ	Lunch from the Duck is something to look forward to. They call their sandwiches Nooners ... how could you not love that?!  It's a step above your typical deli, so be prepared to pay $10 for a sandwich. Yes, a sandwich. Everything is made fresh to order. I usually go for the albacore, which includes celery and water chestnuts, and I add Havarti and pickles. Yummm. They're a reliable source for Selma's chocolate topped rice crispie treats, too.  Call ahead to find out what the daily soup special are, and if they have chicken and dumplings GET IT.  You also can order online - whether you just want something for yourself, or you need a platter of sandwiches and some fresh baked cookies for a meeting. Ordering ahead will save you a little bit of time, which helps since the visitor parking is limited (you can use the garage and I think they validate).   All three stores are family owned and operated. You get a great lunch AND you get to support a local business. It's a win-win.
2	tbEoFzqhvPnk7tETWICPw	Not the best, not the worst.  Food was ok to good.  Went here thinking I was trying out a Mexican restaurant I had read good reviews for on Yelp.  The reviews I had read were actually for Taqueria Guadalajara, but we ended up here.   There weren't many cars in the lot but there were a few families there to eat.  We walked in and had to wait a while to be greeted.  The gentleman was pleasant and seated us.  The menu is too busy for my taste.  Prices were fair for the meals served and I would say moderate in price.  I had some Chimichangas which were pretty good.  They are the small kind, about 4 inches long and stuffed with meat.  The chicken was not as moist as I would like it but not dry.  (Dry chicken is a big problem at Mexican restaurants from my experience.)  The sauces and sour cream was watered down, runny, which I have also seen at other Mexican Restaurants.  Is this a way to make the salsa stretch?  Not sure.  Maybe they like it this way.  The sauce wasn't near enough either, had to order more. The chicken burrito was large but mostly meat.  Needed more rice, beans etc.  We weren't too thrilled with this.   The eating area is pretty large. It is like a large cafe.  It would be a good place for lunch if you had a large group and wanted something quick.  For dinner I would go elsewhere. With so many other good places to go to I would say not to bother with La Hacienda. One last thing.  I got the impression that the staff didn't really want to be there.  Like they were holding things together.  Not the best spirit to impart.
2	m5n78CAzWLID4dkRBANtw	Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street.
2	wQGCYUXRsFQK3nrxKuIr7A	First off let me state that normally this store has provided me with great service and product.  However, on 12/18/13 we ordered several of the pzones.  The delivery service was great, and the delivery from this store has always been great.  The pzones themselves were real good.  However, the marinara sauce that they gave for the pzones was the worst excuse for a dipping sauce I have ever experienced.  The sauce was so thinned out it was like water.  Dipping the pzones in that sauce was useless.  The dipping sauce just washed right off of the pzone.  So the lackluster dipping sauce just ruined the pzones all together.     I don't know if this is the way their marinara sauce that comes with pzones is supposed to be like, but if it is I will never order the pzones from here again.  I'll just stick to their pizza or order from a different pizza place.  This was definitely not what I have grown to expect from a National chain like Pizza Hut.  Update  Pizza Hut contacted me and gave me a credit towards future purchase due to my experience.
2	725WuTzoPwZODb4FswjyA	The second I came in to Au Petit Four I was really hoping to have a wonderful breakfast. Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.  We ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.  My normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.  My friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.  The service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food.
2	2xbvOi1uZWrmF8bw1TctQ	This by far is the most over rated green chile Ive ever has the displeasure of waiting an hour for! There are FAR better places in the valley that serve better green chile.. the tortillas however were awesome enough to go back for though with the lines of people I wouldn't even bother.
2	Cf0pRrEmbWzqY336GXIp8Q	I realize that a place that has a majority of their menu priced under $2.00 is not going to blow me away... BUT, the wait times are HORRIBLE!!! Whether you go in or the drive thru it's bad either way. I'm in Boca Park quite often, so I'll run in from time to time & it's NEVER good! The employees are rude & it's always 15-20 min wait times! The only reason it gets an xtra star is I can get a side salad with low-cal dressing for $1.00. I've never been to a McDonalds that was this consistently bad...
2	0A6zbn0dbiQ5jZcAgm7jcw	I've been delaying this review, partially because I did not want to relive the experience and partially because the owner is so nice that I didn't want to say anything bad about her restaurant. But... My experience was horrible. I had gone to Greekfest with my parents when I was younger and I loved it. My parents had nothing nice to say, but for me it was the greatest. I was 12 years old and not paying for it, which might be the difference. It has apparently not changed in that many years. I went on a Tuesday evening with a fiend of mine for what was to be a three hour long ordeal, not because we were having a laid back, relaxing dinner, but because the restaurant could not handle being "slammed" on a weeknight. The truth is that there was a group (who had made a reservation) and one other table when we walked in. Even when the group had gone and we were left there all on our own, the service was horrendous. The hummus was alright, but we were charged for the accompanying pita. I thought, given the price of the entrees, the pita could have been included. I ordered the swordfish and a friend ordered lamb, I think. They were out of both. I ended up with the salmon and she had the steak. While she enjoyed her steak, I feel like I could have had better salmon in my own kitchen. It was overly spiced, and drowned in sauce. There was no taste of salmon to be found. The desert was not as great as I remembered, but they sure are pretty. We had the galatabouriko, my favorite. We also chose a fig desert, which was a little grainy. The whole ordeal came to about $90 plus tip. Usually a good tipper, I left an appallingly low tip to make a point. Occupying the only table in the restaurant, we should have had better service. Toward the end it seemed like a joke. We stared at the owner and waiter waiting for the check, and then had to wait another twenty minutes for them to pick it up before we finally went up to the front to pay ourselves. I won't be back. I won't tell other people to go. The atmosphere was nice, but they seriously need to improve the quality of the food and the service before they can charge the amount they do. The two stars I left were for my friend's meal, the physical ambiance, and nostalgia, along with my hopes that the owner will read this review and improve the restaurant.
4	o4Du2FXkUy8ZWPLmaiJ2Lg	The reviews are spot on.  My husband and I went to this place for an early dinner.  Yes, the area looks a little rough but it was pretty early.  I followed the recommendation of other yelpers and ordered the shrimp culichi, very good choice.  My husband had the Torito de camaron, a yellow chili filled with shrimp, even better choice than mine.  The salsas were so good, the tomatillo one had enough spice for me.  I can handle spice, the red one was great too, however a bit too spicy for me this week.  Maybe another time I might enjoy it more.  My husband loved it.  We also had the shrimp meatball soup, very well seasoned and delicious. BTW I loved their corn tortillas and they told me they get them at the Sonorense.  They were fresh and cooked to perfection.  I dipped them in the green salsa, YUM. The margaritas are ok, but I was really here for the food.
4	YcsCo8PWoaFPSo6Z5lGYaA	ZOMG this place is a UIUC mainstay. It is fairly cheap and you get lots of asian food. To be fair the food can be greasy but it's college, you probably get worse in the dorms.  Chicken Pad Thai with no egg? GAME OVER. HoG wins.
4	J5zKDal2gCBSKft1NarsFg	For a fast food like place, this restaurant is actually pretty darn good. They have a great variety of sandwiches, salads, flat breads, pizzas, etc. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that they are just a bit expensive for what they have.
4	vYS2HurxeUC81IkPBlOtw	Food was excellent!  The sushi was fresh and really good, the gyoza, soup, salad, and chicken teriyaki were also all delicious!  I can't wait to go back!  We went on a Friday night, so it got pretty busy around 7pm.  I was weary after reading the other reviews, but I'm so glad I didn't listen!  3 couples went, one of which had 2 children, and all 8 of us loved the food we ordered!
4	B51nx75bvXaYw2Bbb3H1w	This place is good for what it is... A cheap, mock Asian food place. Don't come here expecting gourmet or authentic food. Sometimes it's the cheap overly Americanized stuff that's the best. The chicken teryiaki bowl is great. The sauce is sweet and they really put a lot of it, I just wish they would put more chicken and veggies.
2	9oLxLor9kv35gPkaEztKQ	My wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit...  We had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out.
2	mKn15D23ZX25b9h3CEUIyQ	Four star food, three star service, and two star ambience.  Went in, got the stink-eye from two or three folks sitting at the bar watching the hockey game.  Sat in the dining room, and it was spooky quiet; for the first half of our meal, no one else was there, there wasn't music, and the only other sounds came from the next room, which just felt odd.  Atmosphere was bad.  Got the pasta roll, which was absolutely delicious; awesome pasta/pine nuts/spinach under a relatively light red cream sauce.  The salad I had was lackluster, though; wilted greens, dry shredded carrots, and a pepperoncini that was just off; it tasted bitter, which was an all-new, all-bad taste for those.  Ew.  Five star entree, two star salad, maybe.  There were two waitresses and only two tables; refills on water were pretty quick up front (several times), but we wound up hanging out for five or ten minutes after we were done eating before seeing our waitress again.  Two and a half stars?  I'd stop in and get a pasta roll for take-out, maybe, but there's a lot of competition for selling red-sauce italian food in the Italian neighborhood, ya know?
4	iYdg8hd4LwP6DQlMTXYexg	Little Ceasars has gone back to a simple menu and kept prices down. Really good place for a quick $5 pizza. Staff seemed overwhelmed, but very friendly. Do note, this is to-go only, no delivery or dining room. Would definitely stop here again
2	xyehEELj6ATm3MO3MyGSA	We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected.    However management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up.  Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable.  It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order.  So we did.  It took a really long time for the food to come up.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees.  The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, "oh sorry!" as she dashed away and that was the end of that.    So the food was average, not great. The service was rushed and unfriendly. Not worth the price.
2	IUAQcOfIztoGbgFMTyLowg	Was enjoying dinner and a beer @the bar when a guy walks in with a 2yr kid in his arms & sits @bar next to me! Then guy puts kid up on the bar! Kid is caring on and yelling sitting on top of the bar! Evidently the bartender knew them. I Complained to manager. He couldn't have cared less. Won't be back!
4	VriMOA5qdez9h81cLglA	I know I just wrote my review but I stopped here again on Tuesday (11/11) to meet my boyfriend,his sister, and her husband for dinner/drinks and the Pens game and I had 2 food items that I would order here regularly so i had to update......for my meal I had a turkey rachael (and yes I had it on rye not my usual italian or French) and this easily was one of the best I've had in awhile (not quite as good as my favorite from the Smallman Deli but still close). The chips were homemade and crisp-kettle cooked how I prefer them. For apps our table got cajun wings (I did not try these) and a Buffalo chicken pita pizza ( grilled chicken set atop pita bread with Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing) and the pita pizza was 4 pieces so it could easily be a full meal too-which is exactly what I think I'll do next visit. It wasn't overly hot and the ranch definitely helped tone that down. Service, as usual, was stellar so will be returning soon!
4	6FIRx4LOTeSXtZ3xyO7ag	Do NOT confuse this with the CJ on Thunderbird. Same name different owners.   I went here on a suggestion from the guys at Batteries Plus on Cave Creek and Bell Rd. He said they have a great burger/frys/drink combo.   Shoo Nuff! The darn parking lot lingered of fresh hickory smoke and I knew it wasn't from the mexican food place. Good Start.  I walked in and headed right for the bar. I judge a food establishment by the bar.... just kidding.   The bar was large, clean and in front of several tv's. I waited for about 2-3 min for the bartender to see me because she was talking to patrons. (this does not bother me, instead makes me enjoy the place more.)  I asked about the grub/brew special and she said. " it is either a burger, frys and drink (draft or pop) OR ~~WTF there is an or??~~ a pulled pork with frys and a drink (draft or pop)   Well after smelling the smoke from the car I knew I had to get the pork. Plus I had a fresh from the dry cleaners WHITE shirt on.   I get my Mt Dew... yeah! and two seconds later a nice large size pulled pork on sesame seed bun, with a ton for frys and a pickle spear.   The pork was PERFECT. Great flavor, cooked slow, nice meat with no fat. The sauce was better then average but lacked a little. Maybe a spicey bbq was what I needed. The frys were bar frys, cooked perfectly and plenty to eat. The pickle was well a pickle.   The Mt Dew rocked!  The bill came to under $6 and I was happy. I didn't even spill on the shirt. (I do smell like a camp fire but I like that)  The place is large but with a small feel. The servers are attentive but not intrusive, the food is great from the one sandwhich I ate. I did signup for a "discount card" they offer. It is a point system and you get discounts off of the food and a special something on birthdays.
2	UoUzpY0VTaRzyasa75DpFQ	I'm surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received. The food is horrible, and having lived near Jerusalem, let me tell you - the food here has nothing to do with Jerusalem. Just not worth going!
2	bZr53THS933MxYLUip8oQ	I am not 100% sure why, but I just don't feel like this store is very clean-- I haven't seen any evidence of dirtiness- just has that feeling.  But I keep going back because the food is good and is fresh. The staff has been friendly and professional. Prices are reasonable for the level of food that is offered.
2	Tx0t7Jr6K7UicgbWympFsA	This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?  So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert.   Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.
4	qu5KLKbKmthoZVh8YZQQQ	What I love about traveling is going to all the different eateries there, which we don't have in Hawaii. My first breakfast stop was the Village Inn. We had many of these in Nebraska where I attended college, but never really took advantage of a good breakfast place. See here in Hawaii we have 2 places in Mililani where I live, Zippys, and the Mililani Golf Course. Each has their own specialties, however, nothing like a big breakfast to get you going and out of the jet-lag feeling. This Village was right next to our hotel. We walked up, and was seated right away. My dad ordered a 3 meat skillet, which had sausage, bacon and ham along with 2 eggs, over some homestyle potatoes, and 3 fluffy pancakes on the side. My mom ordered the french toast-and just ate eggs from my dad's plate. I ordered the Country skillet which had loads of potatoes, covered with country sausage and gravy, then smothered with scrambled eggs, and a side of 3 pancakes (see picture below). Wow! What a way to start of the day. Besides Dennys (we have 2 in Hawaii) there are not many places where you can get breakfast around the clock. Well Jack in the Box does it, but who wants fast food all the time?
4	ChsggqTPrnkoKLUXZfIRGA	How on earth haven't I reviewed this place before? It's really good. The coffee is always fresh and promptly served, and the owner, Ma Roz, is great about remembering you after a visit or two. It's a very family-type place, both in that lots of families go there to eat, and also that there's a familiarity that builds up very quickly. After I had my wisdom teeth out, this was the first place I went to eat once I could chew solid food again.  It's a dive diner, sure -- but it's genuine, unpretentious (*cough* Taste of Dahntahn *cough*), and they serve some seriously good comfort food. The homefries are yummy as hell, and the breakfast sandwich is ridiculously cheap for the amount of food you get in it.   And definitely, I recommend eating at the counter. The people who work there are great to talk to. As others have mentioned, though, don't forget your cash.
4	VtgqbZESzf3JjudMK6Ysg	Busy at lunch time, but I do like a good Chicken sandwich and this is an awesome one. Plus, WAFFLE FRIES.  When it's busy, they have extra helpers out and about to make the experience busier. Such as the guy walking the drive through lane to get orders paid faster. Or the lady refilling drinks and helping get people seated.
4	TTUTTOIxIklQP2RbrFtsUQ	When I first moved back to the East Valley after a long stint in California the first thing I asked was, WHERE IS THE SUSHI? I needed a fix and fast. I figured my sushi eating days were over when I left the Golden State.   On a recommendation from a friend of a friend who's lived in the area for a long time, we ended up at Sekai Sushi. I had my doubts. I thought there was no way an excellent sushi bar could be in a strip mall in the heart of Mesa but I was seriously impressed from the minute I walked in. The chefs are always super nice, the servers are attentive, and the fish and rolls are fantastic. Everything is very fresh.
2	pTqyXodL3uLkquBINsiA	I liked the fries and the greek salad.  But, I ruined the salad by getting calamari on it.  I was expecting fresh calamari, but apparently it just came out of the freezer and tasted super fishy.  Gross!  It was a little uncomfortable sitting by myself at the bar.  No sports on TV and no one to chat with at the bar.  I definitely picked the wrong place!
4	C1d8SiZSHTd3YkNMxc2w	Stopped here for the first time for dinner. The portions were huge! And its not expensive at all. I had broccoli and chicken in white sauce with steamed rice, and hot tea.  It was good. The staff was friendly. I'd defiantly go back if I'm ever in the area again and wanting Chinese cuisine.
2	4qwGN5epchOABKxn67VQ	Friends suggest this place for $36 AYCE sushi and drink. The place is old and dingy the sushi bar is falling apart. To say service was slow is an understatement. It was 34 minutes after we ordered when we received our first roll. Fortunately, our Sapporo refills came at quicker pace. We tried numerous rolls Mardi Gras roll was most memorable. All were edible, though, none were particularly great. I was disappointed by the lack of heat and flavor.   I'd rather get great sushi elsewhere and pay a few bucks for beer.
4	brxP7hWfhlTRglhJjZpiAg	We plan our monthly menu in advance to make shopping easier, and always allow one Sunday a month for pizza and one Sunday for take out Chinese at Chang Jiang.   My wife is Chinese ( I am not ) and it's important to understand that the food there is not designed to be "authentic" Chinese, it's designed to appeal to the American pallet.  (I have eaten in China , both at home and at restaurants, and "authentic"  Chinese food,  with it's use of familiar spices  in overwhelmingly unfamiliar ways,  probably isn't really what you want!)   And so Chang Jiang succeeds in giving us what we want.   I'm not a gourmet, but I know what I like, and the food is very tasty.    The reason I only give the Restaurant four stars instead of five is that their designation of what is hot and what is not, is way off.  As in, it isn't really hot.  At home when we cook, we always make a separate less spicy plate for my step-son vs. what my wife and I eat.  But he enjoys everything designated as hot at Chang Jiang, with no problem.      We always get the Kung Pao Shrimp,  and then our other order varies, sometimes Hunan Shrimp, or Garlic Shrimp.  If you really want it hot, you'll have to ask for extra spicy and see what happenes depending on who is cooking.  We don't order in advance, we just drop in and it never takes more than  5 or 6 minutes to have it prepared on the spot.   While we are waiting we always see others coming in as well to pick up their take-out orders.   It's not a secret place, lots of folks know about it.  And because we don't just run in and run out again with our order,  we have had the opportunity to interact with both the owner and her husband.  Judging from our brief interactions with them, they seem to be very nice people, so that's a plus too!
4	5OKDhvl2NbnRu4eaDuieA	This place is seriously awesome. You get a bucket of peanuts to start (feel free to throw the shells on the floor) and the service is super friendly. Maybe because he was our friend, but I think they're friendly with other people too. We had the soft pretzel appetizer and my mouth just started watering just from typing that. So delicious. i had a chicken sandwich that was decent - a bit big and overwhelming for my taste but definitely tasted great. But the drinks - mmm. They had a whipped cream flavored vodka and put that in rootbeer to make the most amazing "root beer float" ever. Loved it. I also really like places that have cute specials for every day of the week, I like that feel of a place that you could go several times in a week and have a good time every time. If you're looking for a chill place to eat, hang out, have a few drinks this should be on your list.
4	JqdtPIucK13urDO08n5A	Woohoo! This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!!   The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff.   Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner.   So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please.   The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere.   The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.    I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.
4	6UmCQu4JwQtH8JdVDsWpsQ	This place is actually a pretty good diner, which is surprising considering its a truck stop.  I'd say that even though it's pretty similar, this Pine Cone is actually a smidge better than the one out in Johnson Creek. It's still a truck stop, mind you--the food is still greasy and hearty, but this location always seems a little bit cleaner and the servers a bit more on-the-ball. I've had messed up orders at the one in Johnson Creek, but never here.  The bakery of course, is the main draw. They have a huge variety of sweets and  they're always very delicious. I'd say for the baked goods alone they're worth checking out if you haven't been--in that respect they could easily compete with standalone bakeries.  The prices are extremely low compared to a lot of places around Madison, as well.
4	UzMxvQfGlwLR9o1R5WBTpQ	One of my favorite places to watch "the game." On the weekends, make sure you check out the board at the front door and it will show you where your team is playing int he bar. Three levels. I prefer the downstairs by the couches when my team is playing. It allows for many different sounds going through the same bar with all the different levels and areas. Typical bar food, but it's good and the menu is in depth. There's always a drink special to indulge on game day  Never been there at any other time than to watch sporting events, and probably wouldn't go otherwise, hence why the review is based on game day only.
2	bO0jTwNHngHxnoXiOVVNZw	I have been here twice on a whim. The first time I ate my breakfast there and it was pretty decent. The second time, I placed an order to go and unfortunately I should have checked it before I left. The food was dripping in grease. Not sure what that was all about but I was so disappointed. Did I eat any of it, yes because I was hungry however that was a mistake as I felt sick to my stomach later that day. I will give the restaurant another try  one day as maybe the cook was having an off morning. Like I said before, when I ate at the restaurant,  the food was decent, but take out, make sure you check it before you leave so that you don't end up with a box of grease. Blech
4	UYsi71GskPwa0z3ncLi3RQ	I am a fan, there's no denying that but I will say that if I'm in a hurry I'll drive right by this place.  Be prepared to spend a minimum of 2 hours dining here.  Not a problem really, just need to be ready for that kind of time frame.  On to the food(s).  As you probably know this is a DIY style cooking that breaks down into three courses, cheese, seafood & meats and chocolates to finish it off.  Always top shelf cheese and the meat and seafood are fresh and delicious.  There are several types of chocolate fondue to choose from and seriously you can't go wrong with any of them!  Next time I visit I think I'm just going to stick with the cheeses and chocolates....seriously, the meat and seafood is great but just doesn't compare to the level of tastiness of the other two.  Service is always great and the staff is dedicated to making sure you have everything you need as well as explaining to you how to cook your food the correct way.
2	GubwIsrCzqgsNk1adKYw	I love their food, but hate the service. Every time I call to make an order the man is very rude and I hate it. I still order but seeing as theyre always rude and laugh when I mention something about it makes me want to stop ordering from there. Get better people with actual customer service to work there! Always sound so bitter over the phone.
2	87dHK35NHcKSiiYUoQ88A	I could just copy and paste Kristin S' review since we were a part of the same group that went. Kudos for giving our large group of girls two tables together but BOOO for making us wait so long. Not only was it a half hour after our reservation time but people got there early to warn them of our partys arrival. Our reservation had been down at least a week in advance, it could have been better planned on their part but anyway. The food here is crap... unless you like everything flavored with nothing but soy sauce, don't bother going. I always loved Benihana as a kid and either I grew up and learned what good food really is or this place seriously went to crap. The show sucked, the drinks were weak and expensive and the food was bland. I took my leftovers home to my husband who said "I thought you went to benihana, this tastes like ****" and that was promptly followed by the "did we just grow up because I thought it used to be good conversation."
2	8VtuATwZd3c8FiP4vbw	I used to like this place.  I remember the first time I came here, on New Year's Eve, and the food was excellent.  So was the service.  The server even let my friend take home a bottle of the special plum sauce because he liked it so much.  However, both the food and service have gotten worse and worse and now I never want to eat here again.  First, I realized they put MSG in the food unless you tell them not to.  Wha?  Should flavorful, spicy Thai food need MSG?  And it labels itself as a healthy, vegetarian friendly place.  The service is poor, it takes forever to get your food, and when you do get it you are invariably disappointed.    Last time I ordered Vegetarian Pad Si Ew (normally my favorite Thai dish.  I love the Chinese broccoli and yummy sauce).  Figured since it was a vegetarian dish it would probably have tofu for protein, right?  Wrong!  It had no protein except a few small beans.  It was also made with American broccoli, and the sauce tasted weird.  It tasted like it had MSG in it, even though I requested none.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is also quite weird.  It's located in Commercial Center, within walking distance of Lotus of Siam... so just go there instead!
2	QenylbzkgZCpYUgeXSCWg	I have been a fan of olive garden for a long time but this particular location is a hit or a miss. We visited this location for lunch on last Sunday and ordered lemon chicken and tilapia. Tilapia was broken ND not cooked properly, the broccoli was raw. When we told the waitress she said this was how it was prepared.  The salad which she brought was bland and on requesting to change it.. she got a cup with the dressing. Probably the staff needs more training but I can see it is hurting the brand.
2	NIDgVlL7KwHQFxtXTVnaeQ	This place really sucks.  When you walk into TI, there are people handing out lunch coupons for $7.50 for any entree on their special lunch menu.  We ended up ordering a sampler of their mini sandwiches.  The ones I remember consisted of bbq pork and some other type of pork.  I have to say with 100% certainty that they all tasted like crap.  The only saving point were the fries which were fried really well but messing up french fries isn't that easy to do.  Anyways, we also ordered a salad and it was normal, nothing special.  Martinis and drinks are $9 and come in the smallest sizes.  Be careful and ask the waitress for the prices before you order.  I am giving Kahunaville 2 stars because of the discounted lunch price, otherwise it's for sure a 1
2	iHYbM34yygPQgPH1oHV2A	The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
4	ygwRUbh8H9uzOmPt1b1ZHQ	Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.
2	Y0BWYiR5eaWyld0vjRId0w	I have eaten here several times and the food has been very good. My last visit was different. I had the Sirloin steak w/  melted blue cheese. The steak and potatoes must have been under a heat lamp for a very long time. The steak was one of the worst I have had in a while. It was very tough and over cooked. The mashed potatoes had a crust over them (from the heat lamp?) On the plus side the server was good and funny.
4	YdUVwFHLgmG2fADYmWga5g	YUM. Seriously YUM. Thanks to Brandi L for introducing me to this fabulous strip mall find.The potato-macaroni salad alone is worth the trip to this spot. I adore the bulkogi but really, everything I have had here is very good. Stop by if you are ever in the area. In fact... I think I might do a pick up today!
2	M8YYrVW0d4j2iQp62Qs3A	I'm new to the area,  and have only tried this location a handful of times.  Unfortunately, on my last 2 visits there have been issues.  The previous issue was simple and not a big deal- they put the wrong kind of sauce on my chicken and had to remake it. They offered me a free soda during my wait.   The most recent visit, however, was a bit more annoying. When I showed up, my name was on the "ready" list, but when the guy went to go grab it, he realized only 1 of my 2 pizzas had been made. (Clearly they forgot to make it.). So I had to wait while the one pizza cooked, and the other one sat around (along with my chicken and parmesan bites).  I was offered an apology, but that was it.   I'm trying to figure out if this location has just become too busy and can't keep up, or if they haven't trained their staff very well, or if I've just happened to have bad luck the last 2 times. Regardless, there is a Papa John's a few minutes closer to my house, so I may be trying them next time.
2	Hursf2XqzvzaoSYkiK2MQ	I'm new to the area and didn't know what my delivery options were. Based on the reviews, this place sounded like a home run. I was so disappointed! The food is reasonably priced, they deliver for $12 min, and delivery was quick, so it warrants 2 stars. I also love the fried noodles they included with my soup. Unfortunately, everything about my General Tso's combo was subpar. The meat was all dark meat, and some of it quite fatty. The fried shrimp that came with it tastes old, as did the rice (and who messes up fried rice?).  In the unlikely event that I order from them again, I will steer clear of the chicken!
2	SeKX45FNQ4cgyY2au7jMA	This place was just eh. . .we ordered 2 meals and a dessert. One of the meals was pretty good, but the other meal wasn't so much. The dessert, creme brulee, was awful! Not the worst place I've eaten at, but I definitely won't be returning.
4	81MZpoAAsyxkBp5xgvddw	Nice, upscale italian restaurant. Beautiful decor, great service and great food. The wait staff is very educated and can help you with selections, wine pairings and anything you need. The food is wonderful.   Luce is not inexpensive but is well worth every cent. Located at the base of the Hearst tower so parking there is easy and it's a central uptown location.   Worth a visit if you're looking for upscale dining with authentic italian dishes.
4	19Isxin8OLBilobw5DMDw	This is still my all time favorite sushi place....atmosphere is strip mall blah but the price and sushi is fabulous.  Their baked scallops or langostino's are fabulous. Their Vegas roll is deep fried and though not as refined as Ra's version still very satisfying. Sashimi portions are large and fresh. I also recommend the escolar...slightly grilled with a sauce. Salmon dynamite is good as well. Always something new, though the "crab with a K" in everything is a little disappointing but it's usually out shined by great toppings.   The miso soup and iced green tea are good and you can't go wrong with a sake-bomber!!
4	oo7NvH0fJQjLVSJRcXuY0A	Yum yum yum. Welcome to chipotle/barbacoa's sexier sister. This place is great for a chicken burrito on the go. It's fresh, it's fast and it's consistent. Definitely a place that makes for a great lunch. Plenty of outdoor seating and it's not overrun with birds
4	Udgr6RvMQJnlcBpme11oLQ	We were pleased and disappointed at the same time. The service was good: people knew their stuff, and if you asked further questions they had answers.  But, our table was full of crumbs that didn't get swept up  - what's up with that?! Every course we had was delicious. Beautiful foie gras, heirloom tomato salad with a black ice dressing that was a great treat, BUT, my rib-eye was tough!!  Gristly and hard to cut and chew. Incredibly disappointing for the quality we were expecting. That's why this 5-star restaurant only rates 4 stars from us.
4	3lOrpH4DU6bKuXIm3E1DNA	So if you have 50 dollars to kill on yourself take it to this place, they have some awesome mexican food! like real mexican food, hey im not a novice to mexican food, but this was just fantastic.. actually it tasted better than the food i had down in cabo...  So If you like mexican food and you want a good well portioned mean go here! its pretty awesome!  Oh and the tortillas are had made right in front of you!! just like in OLD TOWN SD.. perty Legit.
2	Q9QYZADd5OqkaBpbxgKXZA	I'm not quite sure what all the fantastical chatty chat is all about. It's ok Mexican food, I've been there three times & have yet to have an orgasmic south of the border experience.  They do fork over the chips & salsa which is a plus, but the salsa is a lil on the ratty side in my personal opinion.  Maybe being from California I'm spoiled with fabuloso pintos?  I most likely won't be going back, I'll just wait until I go to CA.
2	DNSb4VQM2OoQmEJMjcIkjg	O.K. in a pinch, but I've had much better Asian food. The little red pepper next to my dish was supposed to indicate spicy, but it seemed pretty mild to me. The shrimp and veggies were fresh, but the flavors didn't meld the way they should. Sauce was a little too gelatinous, and there was too much of it. Service was unfriendly and perfunctory. However, the green tea was really good--and really, really green. I'm with Matt L. on this one.
2	COIMBf683c7rFTkLMffSKA	I was disappointed with this restaurant.  The food is not bad by any stretch, but it is not of the quality I expect from a restaurant in this price range and with such a reputation.  I ordered the special, which for me consisted of a house salad, ribeye, creamed spinach, and dessert.  I also ordered escargot and we had garlic cheese bread.  The garlic cheese bread was very good.  The escargot was flavorful, but I was hoping for escargot served in the shell (like I had in Paris).  The ribeye was cooked perfectly, but the cut seemed to be of average quality.  The creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland.  The dessert was good.  The only reason I ate here is because I had a $100 gift card to spend.  Overall, it was definitely worth it because of the $100 discount.  However, I have no need to return and there are so many other steak houses in Las Vegas to try.
4	cKZCMr61o75ZkA22Pb3Vw	Great place to grab a quick bite before a meeting in the halls of the Government Center. The cajun chicken sandwich is out of this world and the make your own Arnold Palmer is always a great addition. Make sure to check it out!
4	U5mJxhSQZqgkoZoRYaJYA	O So good!! I usually get the Philly Cheese Steak w/ mushrooms and extra cheese. It is excellent. The atmosphere is Americanized which I love since everything around Central Phoenix caters to the Hispanics first then Americans.  Like I said the food is great, the reason only four stars is because the service sucks (Having to bring the waiter your cup for a refill every time I go there gets a little old) But other than that is definitely  worth a try!!!
4	gjqj09JOTCSaZVpEvdxPA	Because it's a chain, Applebee's is hard to mess up.   We stopped in before heading back to the airport on our way out of Las Vegas. Our waiter was wonderful, the service was quick, and the food was tasty.   Plus, they have these awesome touch screens at every table where you can order appetizers and desserts, and pay your bill (if you're using a card)! How handy!
2	u47AI7PF8Ided8pUYEkDOg	Ive been waiting to write this for a week or so...Id give it 1.5 stars, but they dont have those here on Yelp.  I used to love going to Sweet Tomatoes.  I called it the great upgrade from Souper Salad.   And for a long time it was.. and in some cases, still us.  But let me ask you something.. Why would call yourselves Sweet Tomatoes if you literally had no tomatoes?  We decided to hit this place up because we were trying to eat "healthier."  I know funny, huh?  One could still eat like crap at Sweet Tomatoes.   So get my plate and begin my salad creation.. romaine lettuce,, mixed with some ceasar and that's when I noticed things missing.  No tomatoes, No cucumbers, No egg..  uhh hello??  These are what makes muy salad good.  So here I am left to enjoy a lettuce and blue cheese salad?  Horrible.  They said they'd give us a  break of $2  of our bill.. Oh thank you very much for your hospitality. we came to enjoy good food, but you didn't have any.    My final dinner was a small dish of OK pasta along with a half plate of lettuce and blue cheese.  That was sooo worth $10.  (sarcasm).    My last few trips to Sweet Tomatoes have not been great, so next time someone suggests this for dinner, I'll kindly reply with: "You have a good time, I'll make me a PB&J for dinner."     I hope there's another Souper Salad/Sweet Tomatoes type place out there that would like to open a few locations in Arizona and show these guys how it's really done.
2	lnJuqBF2K2N7aRtGxGOUg	Not my favorite local Chinese restaurant. The interior looks so nice...but the atmosphere is slightly slovenly. The food I had was decent, but didn't have much pizazz. The menu is just a little boring. The service was also quite slow.
4	DdU6bflHOFh8pmVHTcIR0Q	I want to give this joint 5 stars because when made correctly, they have the best pie in Pittsburgh... I am an east coast pizza snob and really not into Pittsburgh Pizza; however I Angelo's at at least once or twice a week   When the man with long blond hair (I think his name is Mike) works, the pizza is 10/10....anyone else and I end up with a slice that's half thick crust/half thin....   Overall Angelo's is still the BEST PIZZA shop in pittsburgh.... Go check it out, like now!
2	YtNVBuj6fzKcHs7gfa1eg	I've always found the location of John Henry's to be rather peculiar. It's at the front of the parking lot of a strip mall that features a sports bar and a women's workout place among other things.   I got the feeling that it would rather be closer to Ray or Warner than Guadalupe or Elliot. Still, it's in a location where it's very conspicuous. So conspicuous that I wish I never noticed it.  The food is egregiously overpriced. The food borders on average to below average. My first inclination that my entree might not be so good was when I ate my salad and it was prepared with ordinary iceberg lettuce and not much else other than a fairly tasty dressing.   A few bites in and I knew it would be my last time at this place. I cannot figure out where Henry's gets off charging the prices that it does and is still able to keep its doors open. Even more perplexing is the clientele.  It was teenagers taking their dates out for a fancy dinner (or so they thought) or groups of elderly people.   It got me thinking there was an early bird special that I was missing out on?  The clientele of JH doesn't bother me like it did some in other reviews, but the food and the prices and lack of quality did. A respectable menu without respectable food for a triple digit bill for two people is unacceptable.
4	NQRZSBmZB0UbUzs51YRw	What do you want CPK to do, back flips when you stroll in for lunch?   Mix things up a little, how?  You dont see Applebees or Olive Garden "mixing it up," do you?  No, because its a chain and one is exactly like another, the food is the same, the place is set up the same.   This is the nature of the chain restaurant beast, so if you dont like it, still to pricey Old Town or NoSco trendy hotspots.  Nothing wrong with either one, just know what you like and what youre getting yourself into.  I'm not quite sure where my rant and thus love for CPK has come from, except that every time I go, I have a good experience.  Food comes out fast (I always have the margerita pizza), service is quick(they know how to handle a large lunch crowd) and overall, everything is consistently good.    So they dont have a circus performing for your lunchtime entertainment.  I dont think they need it.
4	wtzOOPOfR0HSrGWO3mrghg	It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews!  You did not steer me wrong.   A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.  It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every "two-top" had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes.   Recommend!  P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.
4	uuCHGKAB1xyRzP1qU6jDFw	I am a fan of Luke's from my youth in Tucson, where they provided a nearby source of yummu chicago dogs and bigger-than-average burgers.   Let's be honest, the burgers are decent but unremarkable.  They are, at least, consistent in their mediocrity.  Luke's can't hold a candle to Delux or the Sonora Brewery, but they are definitely cheaper, likely closer and they've a down-home feel.  The customer service was fantastic and incredibly friendly.  I definitely felt very welcome and the atmosphere was warm, even if they muttered about my Red Sox stomping the White Sox on the t.v. and changed it because they couldn't bear to watch.  hah!
4	wX2UuHGNVxOSvRe0A6099A	My wife and I love this little place.  Over the years, we've been here for birthday dinners and had two large welcome home parties.  They take great care of us.  Service is always friendly and the food is always good - not necessarily amazing but always solid.  Had dinner here this past weekend and our party had pizza, sandwiches and entrees - all very good - particularly the sausage sandwich.  The fried Zucchini was impressive as well.
2	JKLBxl8JdDm6Cnvs3EtSbw	It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for "holding back" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.  Which hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.  A big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.
4	2RuASf75kU303rdQjFfQ	What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..  A cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.    Cheers ! !
2	2fRTiY7J1s9txk0r1cQg	Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio last Sunday listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.  Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!
2	crBTCZ5DzifbkGFKbgnZ3w	Two stars...for the location and that is about it. If someone with a half a brain would actually take the time to put some effort into this place it would be and actually could be alright...I feel like opening a hot dog stand right down the street, and would probably provide better service and food.  Thought this place would have a great view on the patio but no, the view is obstructed by  a fence and a wall. the chairs a re small and uncomfortable I think they were originally stolen from a child's play ground. In general it was dirty most of the tables were not clean and there were flies everywhere.  The staff was not only rude, but extremely slow, and it was not busy there. There were some dead people two tables away from us gumming their food ...now when I say dead I mean these people reminded me of the dead people from Michael Jackson's Thriller video...they all looked like they had one foot in the grave. For the most part there could of been maybe 7 people in the whole place. Not busy for a s slow as it was.  Plus this place is extremely overpriced. almost $20.00 bucks just for me and all I got was the burger and fries with some Ice tea.  I would say skip this place, pack a picnic and maybe go up to spend a quarter in the viewfinder for a 300 yard view of the lake another rip off...don't waste the quarter...I wouldn't even trust the vending machines outside this place. Find another place at the lake.
4	z7ciXSJyQkCdAhIcdMg	Their pizza is really good. I usually get the stuffed chicken bacon ranch but other ones are good too including the garlic chicken! Their s'mores dessert pizza is amazing. I also almost always get their cookie dough and end up eating most of it myself raw. Definitely call your order in ahead because if you don't you could be waiting a bit. Also there's always coupons out there, so don't forget those!
4	u4BzEPkWtqNiDu9J35w	I'm not a Chinese food buff by any means... heck, this was my first experience at a sit-down Chinese food place. :) We went in and were promptly greeted and shown to our booth, the service was more than attentive, cleaning plates from the table as the last bite was still in my mouth... okay, maybe that's TOO attentive. ha  We tried the crab puffs for an appetizer, and again it was my first experience with crab puffs, but it seemed like there was barely any crab inside the puff. But, what do I know... maybe that's normal? They were tasty though... especially with the sweet sauce that accompanies it. For my entree, I had the chicken and broccoli. The serving was plentiful- way more than I should have eaten in one sitting... but I managed. Hey, I was really hungry when we walked in. :)   And, as an added bonus, I did confirm the fact that Abacus Chinese Restaurant does have an actual abacus on site. It's up front by the register. Check it out!
2	1m1FZSOvKIfacj8dnNmSg	Maybe my expectations for Eleven were too high. I do love a lot of Big Burrito, and with Eleven billed as "contemporary American," I thought it would be a runaway heart-stealer. Unfortunately, I found the food to be pretentious without any reason to be, boring at best, and occasionally just gross. I'm a vegetarian, so maybe their meat dishes are better. If a restaurat goes so far as to have a veg tasting menu, I'd expect something above average for the veggie diners.The signature drinks seemed exciting on paper, but failed to deliver in person. I do remember the bathroom as luxuriously delightful, though.
2	MdLpF0G02OzFkSkIuyvPA	I stopped in for a side salad and a Shamrock shake.  They were all out of Shamrock shakes and there was a week to go before St. Patrick's Day.  Disappointment!  The side salad was just what I wanted to take home and I was out and on my way quickly.  This is a bit out of the way because you have to go north of Sahara to get to it and then back to go west on Sahara.  This is a backup outlet only if I'm in the area.
2	1HmNeDoDNVGSdmKRCETZA	Worked at the office today and for lunch I originally wanted to go to China Inn but it was closed. It was either the Hard Rock or Stoudemire's. Guess you know where I ate.  I ordered yellow squash soup and half a grilled chicken club sandwich for $9 and my coworker order the beer battered fish and chips for $11.  I think they were trolling for the fish and chasing the chicken 'cause almost 25 minutes had gone by before our order was brought to us. The fish looked like chicken drumettes because there was a lot of batter on it; served with waffle fries and a tablespoon of cole slaw. My soup was okay, not hot, good texture but a little bland. My sandwich was okay. The only thing I did not like was the top slice of bread was crisp and the bottom WET!!! .UGH!!! I HATE damp bread!!! Our waitress must have forgotten our order and it must have sat on the counter for who knows how long. It will be sometime before I patronize this restaurant again.
2	McXOuokmjyGs3BwSJEQUOw	Owned by the same parent company as Old Country, and much of the same food, but just not as good (or should I say not as mediocre?)  This location is close to my job and they give a 20% discount if i show my badge, so I end up here sometimes even though it's not so great.  The food's ready to grab and eat, so that works well for lunch hour.  The digs are showing their age and wear and tear, but most of the bussers seem to keep things tidied up (as they try to earn a tip from you, even though they don't even get you drinks anymore)  Pretty much everything here used to be better a few years ago.  The last several visits I've encountered things like wilted spinach one visit only to have my complaint remedied by NO spinach on the next couple visits.  That's what i get for being picky i guess!  Your lunch here will consist of such delicacies as cheese enchiladas, cheese pizza, macaroni & cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn bread, spaghetti, chicken dumplings, soup, jello, and an iceberg/romaine lettuce mix, and a few other things.   'tsabout it. ...day in and day out, with an occaisional 'teriyaki' chicken & white rice or grade-school-cafeteria-grade 'meat' patty on dried bun, or something like that thrown in to keep you on your toes.  They used to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serve machines, but usually it's only one or neither.  Just like the main courses and sides, the dessert selection just isn't what it used to be.  The creme brulee and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charge that $2 more.
4	c28sNDugVh9CnQvMIO9Sw	I actually like this place. I find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right. The food is well prepared and the alcoholic drinks are fantastic. Martinis! My one complaint....they need to add some more vegetarian dishes.  I find myself ordering this great appetizer every time I go there because it's the only thing with tofu on it. Anyways, it's a great place for a date :)
4	3jJ1SkAoPXmfXniRA6LzUw	We stopped here on our way back from Wildlife World Zoo after seeing they changed the restaurant there and it doesn't have very good reviews. This was a great alternative. Plenty of food and a nice variety. I enjoyed it.
4	3rQshzQOIOFjTmn8wQQ	When I'm in the mood for a creamy desert I will always go to Nielsen's. I prefer the baseline/power location but this one is bigger. I do miss the Iceberg that use to be in this location. I like the choices of mix-ins for the custard. I always get Captin Crunch and Maraschino Cherries. Sadly I do not visit this place much anymore cause of my addiction to tart frozen yogurt, but when I get the creamy craving I go to Nielsens.
4	cT5UjZAXjV1CXIVbr3119g	Wonderful place to enjoy pizza (try the Hero Pizza), calzones, and homemade pita w/Tzatziki sauce. Delicious! The service here is great as well as it's dark and cool to duck out of the 3-digit temps for a bit. Has a "Sporty/Italian" vibe to it.
2	Ng1hbAxT1UCcwGRYBXG0VA	Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, "Why am I going back?"  Mediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.  Last time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?  Today I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.  I was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much.
2	yJM3mxrJi2pTloH7XuTilQ	The chicken salad is made with turkey.  If they lie about that what else are they lying about.  The food is good and fairly priced.  I also like the salad that they have.  If i am in the area and hungry I would probably visit this place again.
2	du9EtlaV7AihD69KdNgA	Okay.....I've only been here twice, so it's hard to judge.  But there were two things I disliked.  1. Hardly any outlets! 2. My chai latte, which was neither hot nor very tasty.  wah waaaaaah.  It's like, a block from my house, so I'm sure I'll give them another go.  There was a super friendly barista dude there last time, and the outdoor patio looks nice in summer.  But I'll need to have a tasty beverage of some sort in order to up this review.  sad face because I love local businesses!  But....I also love tasty chai lattes.  and I did not get one.
4	3bezA90mUfeN1WqznPaQIg	Overall great food. I highly recomend the Thai chicken or buffalo chicken pitas. Very good and healthy alternative for lunch. They cook to order and you can watch them make your food. Very tasty and healthy, but unfortunately pricey. 1 Regular Pita is about $7 not including chips or drink.
2	i6uJtRHx3Zpe097NcXXZng	This place is...hmm...in a strip mall.  It looks a bit rustic from the inside and out.  We sat at the sushi bar instead of a table.  Our chef was cool and very quick.  Behind him was a wall of business cards that kept my attention for the remainder of the dinner I did manage to eat.  My boyfriend had the all-you-can-eat sushi.  I had the beef and chicken teriyaki (as I do not eat anything that lives in the water except seaweed).  My meal came with miso soup and a small salad.  The miso soup was pretty tasty!  And the small salad very basic but had an excellent ginger dressing atop of it.  My entree looked really good when our waitress served it but, as I began to eat it, it was full of fat (both on the chicken and the beef).  I guess that would be okay if I liked gristle and fat but, I hate the chewy stuff--it makes me want to puke.  I probably ate 2% of my meal, not including the rice.  My boyfriend ate most of his rolls but later commented to me that he didn't think the ingredients were very fresh.  Overall, our chef was cool.  Our waitress was very sweet and attended to us very well.  I think the restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and remodeling whenever they get a chance, but hell, what do I know?
4	Za0WTNFC2DL3HM6XpxxkBw	I kinda like the Native New Yorker. I mean, if trashy bathrooms isn't your bag, this might not be either. By that same token, I can think of quite a few other places where the bathrooms are considerably worse than here.   They have some wicked happy hour specials on wings and other greasy snacks and even regular priced pitchers of beer aren't bad.   It's a refreshing alternative to the stuffiness of most Scottsdale bars and even somewhat in comparison to bars on Mill. Ideal with about four people and no schedule.
2	c9zioYqCA6IXHfmf5q0w	The Olive Garden is bad. Not to jump on the hate train here without just cause, but I went in here a few months ago after being enticed by an almost too good to be true special. It had to do with all you can eat and pasta and I think it was like seven dollars.   The moral of the story: You get what you pay for.   The pasta was so bland that I can't even think of an adjective to describe how bland it was. (Did I just blow your mind?)  Service was friendly and as good as it could be but half-hearted, sorta like they knew the food was bad. Hmm. Go figure.
4	7zt9WB6MjW2eDxCMGRqqQ	If you are into happy hours and/or lunch specials at bars on random weekdays, this place is THE BOMB. Here's why:  Monday: 2.25 bud lights 4 dollars Smirnoff  4.99 lunch- double cheeseburger  Tuesday: 2 well liquors 2 dollar drafts, $1 TACOS  Wednesday: Trivia night, 2.25 bud lights, 2 wells 4.99 lunch- pepperoni pizza  Thursday: lady nights, $4 sangrias 4.99 lunch- buffalo chicken sandwich  Friday: 22oz beer price of pint 4.99 lunch- 1-topping pizza  Lunch: 11AM-4PM Happy Hour: 4-8PM, appetizers are HALF OFF.  This place is a win if you go on the right day. The food isn't phenomenal, but it's definitely worth the $. Eat on!
4	X1ypmUslf7gA65b1pLpoUw	Iconic diner so I've been told and the proof for me today was the fact that the parking lot was packed and there were at least 10 of us standing outside in line waiting IN THE RAIN for our turn at breakfast!  That says something either about the diner or about us (nevermind).  The line went fast and we had friendly and efficient service from our server, typical diner fare and what I expected.  It filled my stomach and I was happy.  I ordered french toast, bacon and orange juice -- nothing fancy.  Note that they do not take credit cards.
2	dz9hEyNeIvzIHZQ7G2Vg	1 mile from Nellis - no military or senior or anything specials.  Bleh!  The McDonald's around the LV Valley offer a 10% discount - so boo to this store.    Service was fast, professional, but.......that's it.  So, I'll support those that support me, and drive a few miles to the McD's that does offer "a break today!"
4	5jTUuGr3CNTDfJmuuqr0uQ	This was our first time back in a few years, and once again, they have a new menu.  This time we (my wife and I) just stuck to the basics......Chicken Tenders w/ fries and I had the Chicken Sandwich w/ Cheese, Bacon and BBQ Sauce with fries.  The service was fast and friendly, and the food this time was outstanding.  I am not sure that I like the new menu and prices, but we will consider coming back in the future, for the chicken.  The restaurant is very clean and the decor is very casual......   NCFoodGuy
4	hrMGV967omn20Vx00Ex3AQ	My boyfriend and I have been going to IchiBan constantly for sushi for the past two years. We love it. They know us and always greet us with complimentary edamame and sometimes even soup. At the end they even bring us fruit!  Ever since half price sushi, there's just no reason for us to ever go anywhere else for sushi. We love it.  As far as the cooking tables, I'm not a fan. I like cooking tables at other places but IchiBan is a much better sushi restaurant. The cooks are friendly and creative and entertaining but the food itself is just sub-par and the prices are a little high.   All in all an AMAZING sushi place but I wouldn't suggest going for the hibachi tables.
2	PWGghHtz1ns8sqoLC3kQ	I have been ordering from here for awhile.. I dont really like it and there are better options for chinese fast food. But they are fast and cheap which is why i usually order from them.  Some of the dishes are really good. While most of the dishes seem like a very cheap ripoff of what they should be.  All the sauces taste like they came right out of a container, and for some reason they bread everything! Even the sesame chicken.  I will order from here again but i will stick with the lo mein.
2	pOslHBQX4tCtH4ZfyhaoLw	While this isn't the fanciest of places by any means (two hand-written signs on the wall proclaim "no cigar smoking in restaurant"), the food is quite decent.  Also be forewarned, this is certainly a local hangout, and as such you won't find niceties such as a hostess (you have to seat yourself) and they don't have a non-smoking section (all tables are smoking).  That's the way that the clientele likes it, and if you can get past those things, the prices are decent, the service quick, if not exactly stellar, and the food hot.  The quality of the food may not exactly be the best, but let's face it - when you're at a 24-hour eatery, you aren't always looking for the best food, are you?  Most times when you stop at a joint like this, you're looking for the fastest service, and as long as it's edible, it will be fine.  This location is no exception to that rule.  The food does quite well in that regard, in fact, and might even exceed your expectations.
2	6UckpmcYSuEPLVLoRgB9sQ	Augustus Cafe just seems so out of place in Caesars Palace, like it was just thrown in there just for the hell of it.  I've been here twice, once for lunch and the other time for a late night meal.  I had their 3 egg omelet for breakfast which was good and filling and for the late night session, I tried their cubano sandwich, that was just okay.  It seemed that for both times I ate there, the waiters didn't seem very motivated and sounded like they didn't want to be there, and at times they disappear when it's not even that busy.  Also, the decor is very unimpressive and uninspiring.  If this is their answer to the Grand Lux Cafe, they've got a lot of work to do.  Not coming back here anytime soon.  Sorry.
4	Wk9HThqc9Q8wjS0MUFM0g	Awesome pizza for delivery. Top choice over pizza hut, dominos or any other pick up or delivery place. Prices are good too. They said it would be an hour but it got there in 30 min, no complaints with that.
2	765HjCfj2jG30kplIAW8ew	I came to work in Gila Bend for a couple of months and Being that its the only Mexican restaurant in town, I was very excited to go there.  I was craving some flautas and went there for some. I placed the order to go and couldnt wait to get to my room and gooble down the flautas w/sour cream and guacamole! When I got to my room and discovered that they were Rolled Taquitos, you know the frozen kind you can buy like 100 to a box, I was beyond disappointed and not to mention furious! Flautas are the easiest thing to make and it was a major disappointment.  A Mexican restaurant that puts out this type of quick fix doesnt take pride.   Since I dont have kitchen access in my hotel and most likely have to return to eat there, being there arent that many choices in town. I held my tongue. I just know not to order that next time.
2	nY1BfqvM6eaU5iYdxS5Q	I could have had gelato.  The G-Spot is also on the way home. I could have had a lot of other things but I was just too lazy to get out of the car. The Beautiful Carin and I were on our way home last night.  We attended the terrific Yelp event at La Bocca. I grabbed a biscotto (singular for biscotti) on the way out (delightful...crispy and chocolaty with sweet anise finish) and I really should have been satisfied with that, but Noooooooo! I had to have something else. That turned out to be DQ on Scottsdale Road.  If you happen to be going north on Scottsdale Road, you can't successfully "drive through" this DQ unless you successfully "jump the median curb" and "avoid a head on collision"...all possible with all wheel drive, so I was good to go on that front, however, I arrived at the speaker to place my order in a slightly less relaxed state than I had anticipated. So I was less inclined to be forgiving when I ordered a waffle cone and heard my confirmation come back as "&&^&*^~%^^%%$@~%&@%*~^(&(@&(~@^~*^@^@^~*@^". It could have been that they were saying "yes sir, we will have that cone ready for you at the window", but we'll never know. Got my cone ($2.50), and it was already drippy...I know, I know, it's soft serve (that's what she said:), but still, I expect it to maintain a somewhat frosty and cohesive state, and wait until I get out of the drive through before it falls on  my lap. But, I suppose it tasted OK (the part I got to eat instead of wear). So, dripping cone in hand, we now get to try to successfully leave the drive through at DQ and return to our northbound heading...good luck! We were again fortunate that we have all wheel drive, because the driveway is steep enough to be labeled "curb" in most jurisdictions.  We bounced out into traffic and now needed to make it across 3 lanes of southbound traffic, make a u-turn across the median and negotiate the northbound traffic flow...with one hand! I was saved by 2 things: I spent part of my youth rodeo-ing (bareback bronc's) and I spent a considerably longer time racing (sports and formula cars). So, even with reflexes and visual acuity dulled by age, I was able to safely negotiate all of the hazards encountered trying to "drive through" DQ. I could have had a cookie. The ice cream stains came right out:)
2	QkV5si39hGB6odJjApKZQ	Let me first start off saying when it comes to Thai food I am very picky being half Thai I know what to expect...I came here for two reasons 1 it is close to where I was visiting 2 it was voted best Thai...I had the Pad Thai and portion size was good had Chicken and Shrimp in it however it DID NOT taste like any i have had before and not in a good way.  It was way to vinegary or something and it was a red hue not brown.  It just didn't taste like my moms or any Thai resturants in my hometown.  I also tried the coconut ice cream..it was good homeade coconut ice cream rolled in peanuts on a bed of sweet coconut rice.  All in all to say that I was disappointed is an understatement.  I will not be back.
4	7ppTo4stEnpziGI2pyuBCw	This restaurant is tucked away in the Carmel Commons shopping center off of Hwy 51.  I've only been here for lunch, many times, and their lunch specials are very good and affordable...$7.54 I believe?  It comes with an entree, soup of the day and iced tea.  The menu rotates so some of the dishes aren't always available but the traditional noodle dishes are always on there.  I really like their house noodle (kind of a mix between Pud Thai and Pud See Ew).  They also have good curry/rice dishes.  Their ingredients are really fresh and the noodles are some of the best I've had from a Thai restaurant.  Lunch on Wednesday is always really crowded (I believe it's because of the hot and sour soup served that day only) so get there before/after the lunch rush to avoid a long wait for a table!  4 stars because they could use some more staff on hand otherwise I'd give them a 5!
4	UhHtLoAeWmLHXqUSF0euFA	Four words: Italian Special Garlic Bread. Scrumptious. The place is a decent value if you get the large and share. Average sandwich shop decor. Super friendly grey haired owner/manager as well as the one male employee who I swear has been there forever. Always forget to get a coupon. I see them in Airpark News.
2	oFhVDPMJU3e4qI8RjAkHzQ	Yuck!! What happened to the pizza?  Hubby and I usually love Peter Piper pizza but not the other day. Showed up for lunch  buffet on a Wed. All the pizza slices we tasted seemed off.  The crust was like cardboard but greasy at the same time.The sauce was not flavorful like in the past. And the cheese wasnt good either. The pizzas all looked as though the sauce and cheese had been stirred together and then smeared on the pizza. Weird.   Perhaps the smell we noticed when entering was a warning. If this is a recipe change it is not a good one. The quality of the pizzas has deteriorated. Beware!
2	bqxDmVEOAccbkG7l94Ibg	I love Whataburger and I have been to this location a million times, I was just here today and unfortunately I received the worst service tonight. I ordered my food at 9:18 and I was willing to be patient because they had been busy, and I went to tell them my food was not to me yet, and the workers excuse was that they were busy and nothing could be done. It was not until 10 that they came to ask if I ever got my food. However the rest of the people I was with already had their food, they were very kind with refunding my order though.
4	CapuWjQMqxUdWpmk6CITxQ	I like the 50's style restaurants, for some weird reason.  The drive in feature is what actually got me hooked, along with the car hop people that come out with your food.  Yes, I know its fast food.  I can't help it.  Sometimes, a girls gotta indulge, ya know?  When you pull up, theres parking spaces with a menu per parking spot.  You have time to sit and review in your car while you decide what it is that you want.  No pressure waiting in line at a drive thru, espcially if your not sure what you want.  I come here mostly for the drinks during happy hour.  Their half off, and a 44 ounce slush lasts me the rest of the day.   They really do have awesome drinks here, and every day between 2-4 you can do happy hour.  Thats why I come here.  I also think too that they have half priced burgers after 5pm!
4	XxtrJjaWb37dHvnNihbSQ	I went here as a kid every time my family visited Charlotte. I've never had a bad experience or bad food. It's family owned and operated, and the recipes are the same as when they first opened. The atmosphere is unique and whimsical with old pictures, toys, menus, college pennants, etc.  Their meatballs are unbelievably YUM. And the chicken barcelona is fantastic!!  Cozy yet great for groups (they have a large section in the back for groups and overflow), this place has lots of charm and delicious dishes you must try!
4	JUaixPrJSlQZjtdqjhgzA	I love YCs there food is just full of flavor. There are plenty of options to choose from they even have a guide to help you put the right sauces together. But to get rich full flavor double the amount the guide tells you. There's always lots of food and I always bring home left overs. This place is def. worth giving a try.
4	rkZ6brbsC0MV12ILM2big	The food was really quite good at this hotel restaurant/bar. The service tended to be on the slower side so eating here during lunch breaks from a corporate meeting wasn't an option, but we ate here for dinner several times throughout the week we stayed at Chaparral Suites.   I like that they had room charge set up, especially since the food was billed to the company card :)
4	TqRcOTLbS8G2ydEYu4UNWw	It's true, it's a little hard to find, but that usually means better, right?  In this case, yes.    I love this place!  Fresh fish and friendly faces.  The chefs are fun and lighthearted and the owners are so sweet, you get a big warm welcome when you walk in the door. Totally a laid-back casual, friendly environment.  Easy to order with pictures and descriptions of all the sushi on the menu, complimentary green tea, oh and try the raspberry wine, soooo yummy.    They have some dinner entrees and apps for those who dont do sushi, but I wouldn't go there for the dinners it's all about the sushi.   Defiantly not a chain, it's where the locals around here go.
4	itSAZNcaeiGeUvdWNbEVgw	It's been a crazy week in my office, what with it being the end of our fiscal year and all.  So I just had to get me out and have me some good old comfort food for lunch today.  Alone!  So I had me a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries with some coleslaw.  It really hit the spot so I'm upping my rating to four stars.
2	A6aZwimXuq3ZiCpyMWJg	I hate giving just average reviews, but I think this really was a 2 star experience.    Our server was awful.  She was nice but, sorry, pretty dumb.  The soup of the day was minestrone and she said "Don't even ask me what's in it, cause I have no idea."  Really??  I think she was trying to be funny, but it was odd.  Would you ever say that as a server?  And don't most people know what's in minestrone anyway?    So then we ordered our meals.  I got the sirloin and my husband the ribeye.  The steaks came and were put in front of us.  I was pretty sure they were switched so I asked the server.  She said "No, I know this cause of the fat line right here, that means it's a sirloin."  REALLY?!?!  Anyone who knows anything about steak knows that sirloin is pretty lean and ribeye is very fatty.  I couldn't believe it.  I also thought I tasted some Old Bay on my steak.  No thanks, I like just salt and pepper.  I was very unimpressed with the salad too.  Iceberg doesn't do it for me.    On the good side, the hostess and I'm guessing the manager were very nice.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be back :(
2	bDfWQYJT7Jdubnk5B8WCw	This is a two star Jack in the Box. The food is what it is at each location, and it's not like you don't know what you are going to get. There may or may not be a 5 star Jack in the Box, but if you are aiming high then you should start with service.   I get that its late and there is a line full you drunks in the drive through wanting to get some grub after the bars have closed, but there was still no customer service.   After I placed my order, and finally got to the window the guy started to give me the wrong food but luckily I caught it. I was then told that my  food was given to the car in front of me,  which had left, and I would have to wait on the side.   After I watched about 8 cars which were behind me get there food and drive away, my food was brought out to me. Again I am glad I checked it because I was still missing some of the food I ordered and paid for.   From start to finish, time I entered the drive through to time I left the parking lot, this was a 20 minute trip through a drive through.
4	5UeCE4Nz5KfjRMd2YLOVeg	Oy vay! If I had a Jewish grandmother this is what she would have said about me eating to much! My make believe grandmothers name is Chompie, short for Selchompma.   I try to visit her as often as I can even when its been a few weeks she always welcomes me back, like a good grandmother does. She makes the chewy yummy bagels that a chubby guy like me cant resist.. her pirogies are so delicious that 8 of them aren't enough.. everything she has ever cooked me has always hit the spot.. oh Nana Chompie  knows that spot really well.. from the home made pickles she puts on the table to the deep fried goodness of the Monte Cristo sandwich.  I take solace knowing that she will always be there for me, even though she is just a wonderful deli.. I look forward to her warm embrace.
4	mHkZeSFrt8UgG29jd4KBg	I do believe this is the westernmost Waffle House in the US.  Don't be confused by my 4 star rating. Waffle house is not going to make delicious waffles that you could imagine King Leopold of Belgium eating. The eggs are never going to make Alice Waters, Charlie Trotter or Thomas Keller smile and reminisce of a simpler time.   Waffle House is great because it is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I don't think the employees even know where the keys to the locks are. Don't even think of going to Waffle House unless it's between 11pm and 6am, but during those hours, that's when Waffle House deserves it's 4 stars.
2	OR0SCoFAZETxAcojogcA	It is with much regret that I give a 2 star review.  Me and Chuys go way back, like 17 years way back.  Many visits while in college in Tucson and then many a visit while living in Simi Valley, Ca.  Nothing but great experiences.  Now that I am back in AZ, I was longing for a taste of some old memories and went out of my way for a lunch at good ol' Chuys.  The decor made me feel right at home.  The tacky airbrushed paintings, silly wood cut out silloute booths and countless 5 star margarita propaganda.  I ordered my all time fave fish tacos and then headed to the self serve chips and salsa bar.  The chips looked a little stale, but I was in a forgiving mood.  However, when my meal arrived I was suprised not to see the tacos I was used to.  They tasted decent, but not what I was expecting.  My guess is that this location must be a franchise.  It was dead quiet during lunch, so obviously it isn't a favorite of the local crowd.

2	r2bdVMBj9iwkfCQhEbfA	This place probably isn't the typical Long Wongs. It's not in the best neighborhood and had a sign at the counter that said "this isn't Burger King. You don't get it your way. You get it our way." I ordered fish and chips which the menu wall said was batter dipped. I was served beaded fish sticks...(no kidding), like we had in the 70's but they're served with a side of wing sauce. I didn't try that combo though. My husband had wings and said they were average. Fries were pretty limp. Booths were dirty and uncomfortable. I don't know how yelp decided this was a Chinese place. It's everything but.
4	X6Ws35RLqnj3n9xoDcin2g	well i finally took the advice of fellow yelpers and gave Thai Cuisine a shot last weekend.   I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)
4	uQ9LfYkc9BaAbfWhMOvVxQ	Driving down central about to head to another lunch location when the driver starts talking about Burger King and whoppers, so you know we had to find the nearest Bk. The taste of the whopper is so good and unique. Plus I haven't had one in a while.   Upon arriving to this location, it is not busy at all, and the parking lot is empty but that doesn't stop our Whopper journey. It is a dated Bk but playing some good tunage!  The man who took our order was very nice and seemed happy to have a customer We both got whoppers and I actually opted for the double whopper, don't judge me, haha  I didn't know that they got the new Coca Cola machines. I think they're like "free style" super cool and so many flavors. I was happy to see Cherry Coke.   Since the Bk isn't busy our good was made from scratch which is kinda neat The whopper is nice, fresh, and hot  Totally good The fries are super fresh which is very uncommon at any fast food joint :)  This was such a good last second choice and a total money saver :)
2	okged35MF5fb02SGu8izCw	I like Durant's out of principle, but this is by no means a great restaurant by my estimation. The three separate times I've been were riddled with lackluster service, improperly prepared seafood, and meat with the wrong temperature (medium means medium, right? or has beef fallen into the "rare is the new medium" fashion continuum?).   I remain altogether unimpressed. I would, however, hide here if the law was looking for me. It's just that kind of place.
2	EjaOd0POHgytAb03OsMILw	Enjoyed the beautiful weather sitting on the terrace at the Wynn but our service was horrendous.  "I'll be right back" translated into "I'll be back in 15 minutes".  Same as "your order will be right out" meaning "I have not even put your order into the kitchen yet."  It took 35 minutes to get our food after we ordered it and the food was not that impressive.  My omelette was subpar, the hashbrowns were inedible and the french toast tasted almost burnt.  However, the black angus burger was delicious and after tasting my husband's burger I knew I made a mistake in ordering.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry and sit outside if the weather is nice so that at least the atmosphere will make up for the crappy service and mediocre food.
2	U5X7c59vzDiPZ8Nju8oEnQ	Two stars is all I give this place because of service. I really like the sushi here but after more then one really bad experience with the service, my good will has run out. Now I just avoid the place.
2	VdsEMhOCj4DvSkRygMka0Q	We went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp "$10 for $5" deal. I'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating. It was good food, but the price was high and the portions were tiny. The quesadilla we ordered was the worst offender, as it was made from a taco-sized tortilla. I have never seen such a tiny quesadilla in my life. If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2" wide by 6" long by 1" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%. I'm not sure why anybody salts anything anymore, with all the negative medical news on excessive salt consumption, but that's another problem altogether. As for this place: I tried it...probably won't be back. Caramba is a much better restaurant for a much better price.
2	FTLZkgVQ8w6ugMqiIYLHiA	After reading the five star reviews on Del Frisco's and then trying it, I have lost some faith in my fellow yelper's. This is supposed to be a site of reviewers with an edge.. cool people with great taste. A site that stands apart with reviews you can trust.... But I guess I will only be able to trust professional reviewers from now on. And Yelp will just be a barometer but not the final word. Here's my review on Del Frisco's: The wedge was good, not great. My tuna was good. It all goes downhill from here. We ordered my husband's ribeye medium and asked if it was a true medium or more medium well. They said it will have pink all the way through... that it was a true medium. The thing came out with hardly any pink at all. Totally overcooked. Even being medium well, he should have liked it. He ate a few bites and pushed it aside. Flavorless. It must have really been bad because he usually loves ribeye.  And he was hungry. This would never happen at Ruth's Chris. The steak would be gone!  We ordered the Potatoes Au Gratin and they came with bacon, something I had just informed the waitress I don't eat when attempting to order another side.  My husband said it was near raw, anyway.  She whisked them away and brought us onion rings. They looked great!  But... they were undercooked and the batter had zero flavor. It's sad when the Awesome Blossom at Outback (I've had to go when in small towns!) is a hundred times better. Del Frisco's thinks they know meat but they don't. Sides are INCREDIBLY mediocre. So fellow yelpers, were you just so swept away by this "real fancy" restaurant that you convinced yourself the meat here was good? Or maybe it's your first time at an "upscale" steakhouse? I noticed the 5 star reviews are mainly from out of towners. Hardly any locals who know better. I have lost confidence in some of you but I will continue to write because I want to help others avoid making the same mistake we made. Don't let Del Frisco's happen to you.
4	iSHXLolY4TpOQze0O9dxhA	Seeing as how I've been here multiple times, the only rating that seems fitting is the four star 'yay! I'm a fan' rating.  In their adherence to regional style (sonoran style cuisine), Ochoa's par for the course.  Decent-to-good red chile, good enchilada sauce, super-econo lunch special (not plural).  Their lunch special consists of a choice of three items from the usual list of suspects: cheese enchilada, tostada, taco (soft or crispy), tamale, rice or beans.  I think there are a few other choices.  What's nice is you can simply get three tacos and no rice or beans, if you're not one to eat rice and beans.  Or you can get two cheese enchiladas and rice.  Whatever.  The lunch special will run you about $6 plus a drink.  In terms of location, good luck finding this place if you're not from the area.  Atmosphere?  It's a dive, no bells or whistles.  Both of these aspects are major pluses in my book.    Also, anytime I've been here the service is fast.  I've had my meal within ten minutes (or less) from the time I've ordered it.  And it's been served with the cliche' adage, "These plates are hot so be careful."  On the down side, the salsa is hit or miss.  There have been a couple times when I've been there when the salsa tasted like it could have been expired.  Then again, I went the other day and it was fresh.  You'll be able to tell.  It hasn't stopped me from returning.  Now then, if it's just you and an acquaintance and you want to try a spot that is 'authentic' and low key, this is the place.  If you're looking for someplace a little bit nicer with marginally upscale entrees, this ain't it.    For me, Garcia's (the chain) vs. Ochoa's.....Ochoa's.  However, Ochoa's vs. Carolina's,...pssshh, Carolina's.
2	48IQwqcb0UUcQkpwBMSfEA	Exactly what you'd expect from a fast-foody looking Chinese restaurant: fast good, mediocre quality. But it's not as bad as you may fear. A lot of their stuff seemed pretty fresh and not as greasy as most similar Chinese restaurants, which was a huge plus for me. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago and my meal wasn't terrible, so decent in fact that we ordered in recently (super fast delivery--the food was pipin' hot!).   Again, if you're in the mood for a nice chinese meal, head elsewhere. But if you want a quick chinese option, this place is perfect. And that's saying a lot. I loved the Chicken Kung Pao, and the noodles were actually pretty decent, too.   Most of all, the people who work there are super sweet, which makes going there a pleasant experience (although i wouldn't suggest eating there; it's like a cafeteria).
2	2P9RYlvqXWc9gab7ElkLLg	Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke. I had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco.
2	gFLuHWdJBZGEetN0sZXMQ	We ordered delivery from Wang & King last night.  We got the following: Spring Rolls, Dumplings, Thai Red Curry Chicken and Lemon Chicken.  The Spring Rolls were great, even though the mustard wasn't hot.  The Dumplings were decent, however the dough was extremely thick.  The This Red Curry Chicken tasted like seafood and was disgusting.  The Lemon Chicken was decent, however the chicken was over cooked and dry.  I would try someplace else if I were you.
2	J5b66IJJFExTpFptuLJ1Dw	I want to like Pizza Hut, but they just can't seem to get their act together. What you see in advertisements is NOT what you actually get (see pics). Don't bother with this location if you want quality.
4	c7U3CmYM1Ky1OY1i6r5gg	Seaboat is the BEST Fried Southern food around. The wait is long, but the food is definitely worth it! I recommend the Fried Chicken, Fish Sandwich, Fried Okra, Mac 'n' Cheese and Green Beans.  The service is slow, but only because everything is cooked from scratch...and the wait is WELL worth it. Phone ahead, and pick up at the window...it takes about 30 minutes.
2	Q8oF9LteScWcVwmCrS2byw	This used to be one of the best restaurant in town but lately the service takes forever and it seems like the food is not as good as it used to I mean if you want to go make sure you have enough time to wait for your food to be ready because it will take a while but I mean not the best but not the worst in town
4	GwRPy8XEStyZoiQXyXPQg	I went for Sunday brunch.  We got there early, around 10, so it was not busy.  The service was good, as was the food.   The veggie patty was excellent! I like the coffee bar so that you don't have to wait for someone to refill your cup.   I will go back.
4	LJEmTEPiswKrn7C5NZBTeQ	Love this place- the food is excellent. The delivery service is definitely spotty... But I live close enough that I drive over for pick up. Otherwise it takes about 2 hours for delivery. I still eat here at least 2 times a month. Lettuce wraps, Mongolian beef, Sesame Chicken, all favourites. If you want quality taste, and don't mind eating in the hole in the wall dining room or running to pick it up, you will not be disappointed. ;)
4	kL1Y1GmaQWWDeP97Utjgg	I've been to Showmars a couple of times during my lunch break with co-workers.  It's casual, reasonably priced, offers good food, and the service is very quick.  No sooner than we've ordered at the counter and sat down, someone's bringing our food out to us.   I usually always order the gyro ("yee-roh") pita sandwich.  Why?  I'm at a Greek-owned restaurant.  Of course I'm going to go with one of their specialties!  Plus, few places offer gyros...and I LOVE 'em!   I just try not to think of the lambs that were slaughtered so I could enjoy them rolled up in a tasty pita, dripping with tzatziki cucumber sauce.  The fries that accompany the pita are always very flavorful, too.  They're not your average french fry; they have a little spice to them.    My co-worker always orders the fish sandwich.  Why?  The menu says it's the "best fried fish filet sandwich" and he swears by it.  Go figure.
2	8EwBq6JDbL3G5harQcbgw	My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour.   We went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe.   The next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out.   The third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something "southwestern." None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples.   The final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, "Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his "selling techniques" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).
4	Pu0TazBTPS2SmJ3XSED5zw	I will start out by saying that for the most part, our meals were very good, but they were overshadowed by a lousy server.   We waited forever for a drink order and then even longer just to place our order.  My husband ordered the French onion soup, which is a favorite for both of us.   I can say without a doubt that it was the worst we have ever eaten.   Visually, it looked appealing, with lots of cheese and crunchy onions on top, but once you pulled the cheese back, it was a bowlful of bread cubes soaked in broth.   There was absolutely no broth to speak of, so it was like eating mushy bread.   He ate a few spoonfuls and that was it.   We should have complained, but thought the server should have noticed that it wasn't eaten and asked about it.   Unfortunately she brought his salad at the same time, so he had plates all around him.  I had the wedding soup which was excellent.  Loaded with all the typical wedding soup ingredients, and thick and tasty.  My husband had the pork chops, which were tender and juicy.  My Mom had a chicken dish, smothered in onions and gravy which she liked.   They both had plenty of leftovers.   The winner was my veal martini.  Veal slices, lightly breaded and fried, with a two cheese sauce which was excellent.   We all had the twice baked potatoes which were just OK.  Our server never checked on us, never offered drink re-fills, and overall it was frustrating.
4	n27NfToqJps6bYpaiguuA	Hard to rate a McDonald's well.  I go through the drive thru most mornings for coffee and will eat lunch there from time to time.  Drive thru service is always great and restaurant is always clean.  They hire and retain good help.
2	jPJsWdyuaJm8AspzSrm6RQ	I went there for the all you can eat crab leg dinner and the crab legs were very poor quality. The oysters are good there and clam chowder soup are good but everything else sucks in this place. The waiters and cooks are nice though
4	YWifscYhwtNHZGfMgWs1Q	I ate here recently during lunch and had the lunch buffet.  They had a decent selection, about 8 hot items, as well as some relishes and rice pudding.  There is also plenty of naan available.  I eat here at least a couple times a month.  The dinner menu is awesome too, I haven't tried anything I didn't like and we even took new comers there for a joint summit between mine and my boyfriend's families and every one was pleased.  I would also say the attire is not dressy, casual is fine.
4	7WY2N3aDdQBcuxmORwwQ	Convenience has made us frequent customers.  Typically we always do delivery, but we have dined in a handful of times.  The service is good and I have never gotten a dish I didn't like, one of my new favorites is the Cherry Special Chicken.  I may try to order it more on the spicy side next time though.  It is a very sweet dish, but extremely delicious!
2	vcNizbkYhCrGFeNpKu0g	This is the kind of place you find in a mall.  Fast food salad, pasta and pizza.  I had a salad/pizza combo.  The pizza was cold and the crust had a weird metallic taste.  The salad was your standard plate of bland greens.  With all the offices and the hospital nearby, you would think there would be better options for lunch in this shopping plaza. Nope.  That's why I always end up at the Good Egg.  It's hard to screw up an omlette. Despite the high convenience factor, I will not be back.
2	k2ch9RmWisxfGZuGa9z3DQ	Okay so I came here last night, well actually this morning at 1:15 am. I was so dissatisfied with this Burger King!  first Of all, all I wanted was a whopper and a coke. They had no coke. Wait what?! Then when I asked for a coke icee they still wanted to charge me $1.25 for the upgrade. Another person in my party wanted a Cinnabon and nope, none of those either. Also they screwed up our order and charged us for two burgers instead of one. Then when i brought it up the guy at the window was so rude. As if he didn't make the mistake. Long story short, worst 1am food trip..
2	YnOlnCg4Lio6p9fnfrGg	I don't understand the great reviews! Aaron was a friendly guy, but only felt a slight buzz after two margaritas! Normally, I can't finish two! Ordered the toritos appetizer and the shrimp were very small and not very flavorful! The pepper was HOT! And it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce! Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little fiery. I ordered Chili Colorado, which on the menu came with a choice of red or green sauce. I ordered it with green sauce but Aaron said it came with red sauce. "It's chili colorado which is red sauce." I asked him why it says with red or green sauce on the menu. I love chili verde but never had it with beef. I stuck with the red sauce. The sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough. The dish was quite salty and I happen to love salt, but it wasn't a good salty. The beans literally tasted like LARD! The rice was ok. My friend ordered carnitas which was supposed to be slow slimmered in sauce. Wish I would have taken a picture of it - pieces of burnt pork with no sauce whatsoever! He normally likes burnt meat, but the only edible pieces were the ones with fat! I give this place a two because the other two people in my party liked their food. I get better Mexican food back home in Las Vegas. For some reason we thought we'd be getting awesome Mexican food in Phoenix!
4	z6nTv2fHijThV1FCqSMFVw	I think this is one of the most fun places to eat in Charlotte, especially if you can snag the kitchen table. It's a kitschy, tacky, wild and funky place, and the food is huge, plentiful, and delicious. The prices aren't bad, either.   I like the family-style service, although it's easy to over-indulge because everything is so good and so in your face.   It can get a little busy, so sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed. The food can take a while to come out, so although the atmosphere would be great for kids, if your little kidlet is impatient, I would recommend finding somewhere else to go on busy evenings.   They also offer curbside service if you aren't feeling the atmosphere, so order ahead of time, and they'll bring it out to you.
4	aQeJEBQmNDEEpwuNfRfkw	Fast service, good prices, clean, and the food seems good.  Of course, I'm no expert on Chinese food.  I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short.  Take that as a caveat.  Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings.  The crab rangoons don't impress.  Their hot and sour soup is good.  Gentle kick to it.  I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that.  Servings are ample.  The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried.  The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall.  I often wonder about those photos.  A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food.  Curious.  The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees.  What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation.  Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar.  For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint.
4	0Z0HHPrJqseEjSoeSTxceQ	Seems like Political Junkie and I might be of one mind on this place.   There's food, good food, great food, and good-as-sex food....Sophie's usually produces the latter. One of my top three choices in the Phoenix area. Very reasonably priced for what you get.....similar restaurants in Scottsdale offer half the quality at double the price.   If a particular server ...that would be 'Jodie', a tall redhead....is available, ask her for her recommendation of the specialty of the day. We've done this twice and have been very impressed....the results have been delicious and memorable. Ordering without guidance, though, can be a bit more hit and miss....we've ended up with some mediocre entrees, a couple times.   Well worth the time, travel and expense!
4	JGnPqhV6J0rdtjbLe9yfpA	A good, consistent menu that has never ceased to satisfy.  It's got the dark, rich steak house atmosphere without the heavy and pretentious menu.  Usual favorites are the ribs, thai steak salad, and the salmon.  The salad in particular is worth a visit.  It is a complex menagerie of several flavors that blend very well.  Among them are mango, avocado, tomato, mint, basil, cilantro, and a superb dressing.
2	68G8ZkPPLgXTnykGzOFZxw	It's no different than any other Burger King I've been to except they can never seem to get my order right in the drive thru. I just don't bother with this location anymore.  The burgers are fine just probably not the burger you ordered, have the wrong size, wrong flavor of soda...you get the idea.
2	SOJEOi03Kpt9GoprzTdiNg	We started off with a breadbasket and shared a very good Caesar salad. This restaurant, like most of the Station Casino steakhouses, currently offers a $14.99 prime rib special that, in this case, included garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our animal protein, weighing is at close to a pound, was cooked medium rare as requested, but the quality was somewhat south of prime.  Justin, our server, was light-hearted while maintaining a professional level of competence.  Overall the meal was satisfying and represented a good value.
2	NJNBtfB430m6oXKfJD1dZw	I went there tonight to hear live music. I arrived at 6:50 and ended up leaving by 7:15. I never even saw a waitress. Even though the layout is identical to how I remember it when the space was the Native New Yorker it was kept very dark and had a well worn feel to it. What I heard of the music was top notch. Unfortunately, the sound was absorbed by the wall and the seating...lets just say it was all but impossible to see the band. Can't see the band, can't hear the band well, no service - Thats too many strikes for me. I left without spending a cent in the place. Shame. The band was impressive.
2	Pt8yqhH613ocEoKxjT7PNA	My boyfriend and I started going here after a friend of our's enthusiastically recommended it to us. We were impressed the first time and started going several times a month since it was cheap and close to home. I was particularly excited about the uni (sea urchin), ameabi (sweet shrimp) and raw oysters that were part of the AYCE dinner. Over the subsequent trips, however, we noticed that the quality fluctuated pretty wildly, as did the overall service. The last time we went, the chef that was serving us started making lewd jokes, and kept going on for awhile. It was funny at first, but 15 minutes straight of inappropriate "special sauce" jokes does get old. It's been hit or miss- when it's good it can be really good and other times it's pretty lame. Our friend got food poisoning from their oysters & refused to touch them now, por exemplo. It's been at least a month or two since we last went- we've switched to Yama as our primary AYCE location. It's a bit farther from our house but it's been worth it. I liked the tempura ice cream at Sushi on Trop & the Screaming Orgasm, but there's better places to eat at.
2	efiKqqddx41EEwrbM1rQ	Overpriced pizza, pizza is edible but very greasy, unhelpful employees, and bad environment.  Today my mom decided it was a pizza night. Unfortunately she chose this place which is understandably five seconds from our house. When we went to pick up the pizza the guy behind the counter would not get off his cell phone! I definitely wouldn't want to eat there it seems very poorly run. Although the larges were very large, I thought it was very overpriced. Decent enough, but very salty. If I was going to order a Pizza to eat at home I prefer Papa John's over this place!
4	3ec9g424HcUwsyXDFZJ0hg	The service here was great.  I say that because we arrived here about 10 minutes before closing, on two occasions in the past 6 days.  Even though they were already cleaning up and putting things away, the employees still managed to get us some food and send us on our merry way.  The reason we arrived so late is because we were on a road trip and by the time we got into town, all we wanted were some salads and some chicken.  Each time we were here, we ordered about 5 salads and a lot of chicken (ordering for 10 people).  Never once was there a grimace or a sigh or an odd look as if to say "don't these customers know we are closing soon."    Thanks El Pollo for putting up with us and feeding us right before closing time!
4	BALOvF2ZpM7Rl5BpF9Gqw	The wife and I have gone here several times in the evening when we want a simple, casual and easy meal and we don't have the time to cook or feel like it.   Getting coupons in the mail or through the Sweet Tomatoes club definitely makes coming here more attractive-buy 1 meal, get 1 free . Hard to beat a meal for two for around $10.   The food has always been fresh with a wide variety of options to place on your lettuce. There are usually about 5 choices of soup/chili.  The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option.  I enjoy the blueberry muffins.  We went here the other night and were treated to a pretty good strawberry and apple cobbler. In the past, we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good.  The self serve ice cream is always a nice touch or to use and make a root beer float.  This location is usually busy, the couple of times we've gone  but not too loud.  We've only gone on Sunday evening and mid week though.
2	c1B8MPLdjAUqrp7ic3zA	My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.
2	bDLE79CpnNeQ2hmdjWgBiw	As a sushi place, this is awful.  No salmon (only smoked), and the rest of the (small selection) of fish has always been fishy smelling and questionable quality.  I've been here 3 times and its mediocre at best.  Sake selection is small, 1 or 2 low end choices.  However, to give them credit, they do have a good beer lineup and their cooked japanese style food is very good.  Service has always been excellent.
4	jwMHFBod7qmMoO2H0jV1w	4 stars because the staff is friendly and fast.  The restaurant is small but clean.  Strong, free wifi.  Biggest downside is that the location occasionally draws some unpleasant crowds.  About a 25% chance there will a crazy person, a panhandler, or some other obnoxious type there.
4	6Dgd3ipXlFUS9OpA0gFsQ	Hubby has been eating here for years but since I only occasionally visit WI, he never convinced me to give this little dive a try. Now I'm sad about what i've been missing! Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh, tasty, generous Chinese. Clean, open kitchen, very fast and large variety. Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE.
2	igCxlbPxFBDlXUOKTA0Wg	Went there last Friday, had the ACYE, and to tell the truth it was just OK. They cautioned me at the start that I should tell them when I was getting full, made two rolls at a time, and each was, well, just OK. The standout was the Alaska roll, with beautifully marinated salmon and a spicy crab mix inside. The rest was rather blah, and I walked away about $30 lighter with tip and still craving good sushi. I'll try them again but if the next experience is like the first that's it for them.
2	eBxe0NR5JccurE7123Ps9g	I will never understand why this place is always packed? The steaks although lean are never cooked the way you ask them to be. The pulled pork sandwich comes dry (no sauce what so ever). I also think they use more salt then any other eatery I have gone to. You shouldn't have so much salt on the fries that you have to search for signs of potato. I understand people get a kick out of throwing the peanut shells on the floor and all, but it also makes this one of the dirtiest restaurants around. Yes the rolls are flavorful, but tend to be on the hard side. One of my two stars go to their sweet tea. If you pick this place to eat give it a try.   On a side note the wait staff tends to sing Happy Birthday at the top of their lungs every five minutes. Be ready to scream to the person at your table if you want to be heard.
4	JiOdsEHihAY6YejCXa0ccw	The canned mushrooms are gone!  Hurray!  Went back today for lunch for a pepperoni and mushroom Calzone.  It was huge!  The price was $12.25 which is a little high for lunch but it was very enjoyable.  The dough is very thick.  This is the best Calzone I have ever had.  It is filled with lots of cheese and toppings.
4	vhgTyMi0uBJZ4xVxhpHAA	I do wonder if there are just so many Mexican restaurants in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan area that people get very discriminating if they are local.  In that, a place that to an out of towner like me would seem really good is critiqued more harshly by the locals.    My take on this place after a friend brought me here is that the tacos are wonderful, the chips and salsa they give you are pretty good (I've had better chips out there), the Albondigas soup is something I don't get too often back home and I loved it, and that fried ice cream is to die for.    Solid 4 stars in my book.  But I'm from Philly.  To me this place is great Mexican.  You locals may be more picky than I am.
2	yL9aMbRxHoQtcWhefPQNtQ	I really wanted to like this place because of the highly authentic, old-Vegas diner feel.  But the truth is...the food was pretty bad.  I wouldn't go there again.  I hear people rave about the burgers, but in reality they suck.  So, go for the atmosphere but don't expect good food.
2	isQ7P6N9ZmVVfDOqYWqQzA	Because I stayed in Luxor, I ate here because of convenience.  I ate here 3 out of the 4 days.  For the most part, the sandwiches, soups, and salad was pretty good.  It's cafe food yanno?  However, the last day, the  drink server poured too much water in my teapot and when i barely moved it, it swished around and splashed on my leg!  It was so hot that i almost dropped the entire teapot of hot water on my leg but i managed to put it down.    I was hungover and tired and trying to eat something before I catch my flight out so I didn't complain, I just wanted an icebag so I don't blister.  Now here's the bad service part....i had to ask another waitress to find our waitress, our waitress had to call the manager, the manager had to call security.  When he finally came, i said i just needed a bag of ice.  I should've just took it up with the drink server, told her that she filled up the pot to the absolute brim, and had her get me a bag of ice from the kitchen.  oh well.
2	RkpghGXGskvO0iWgxmc6ow	Food court pizza, it is what it is. In this case, a very light and too fluffy crust that is 3/4 of an inch thick. The mushroom & spinach was probably the best choice.  But it's a food court, so choices are limited.
2	yAOa5ANEca52sZCAdOJw	about 10 odd years ago, when i was a newbie to the dim sum world.  i had heard about this place in las vegas.  yeah, it was a damn good food experience, b/c i was from reno where there was no chinese restaurant serving dim sum.  the place has received many awards over the course of the years.  it was such a nice restaurant in those days.  now the pink decor has gone to crap.  it just seems a lot dirtier now.  i have to say each time i go to this place the quality has been on a steady decline.  the basic steam items, such as siumai,har gow, and also the deep fried items...crab claw,  were not spectacular.  the salt-pepper fried shrimp have been sitting out a long time, so they were chewy more than crunchy.  i think i cut my inner lip chewing on the shrimp head.  i didnt see the mango pudding or egg tarts the last time.  im also sad that they didnt have my favorite shark fin dumpling soup item with red vinegar.  finally, a lot of the dishes have been sitting out for a long time.  i was just afraid to touch them.  i still cant believe that this place is so busy.  ive had to wait quite a while the last few times ive come here.  i definitely have to find a better place for dim sum.
2	gaQk4tog3mBoNGn4UAFZA	The service is very slow I went last night and waited in line for a whole hour when there was only two cars ahead of me. On top of that they took order quickly but didn't have meal ready until I was at the window. I probably won't be going here again the food was however good and hot since they had decided to put it in once I got to the window.
4	g80MDePfJesvhJdO6yFR1A	As far as Hooter's restaurants go (blech) this one is probably the best. I give it four stars as a reference to it's sister locations, not in reference to how good it is overall. The food is terrible quality, and the drinks extremely "well measured" meaning they are not strong. Hence why I can drink 12 margaritas in a 6 hour period and still be coherent. They sure charge for them like they are doubles though. There are a few girls working here who are very attractive and friendly (not to sound like a dirty old man, just that usually Hooter's has the worst service) and that definitely helps.
4	nnqJzRcppFlVs5gD8iI2WA	Went to Island's about a week ago. Started with the chips and guacamole; very fresh and tasty. Price of the guacamole was very reasonable given the size, and the salsa was good too. I ordered the Hawaiian burger and it was REALLY good. It was cooked exactly the way I ordered it (medium) and was very juicy. It was a bit messy, but I didn't really care. The fries were also tasty and now come with meals, which is nice. My only complaint was my own fault; I made the mistake of looking up the calores. Do yourself a favor, don't do that.
4	5hxcqJPYpyLKN9QVwnq0Fg	I ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  Everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  The pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy, sauce was good.  I should have ordered the large instead of the medium. I would definitely order from here again.
4	E9zdZg2jV0txEJxkfzaNDw	Yum!  I'm sitting here at work and eating my kielbasa & fries as I'm typing this.  I just had to upgrade my review of Wiener World from 3 to 4 stars!  See, I call myself a "Diabetic Foodie".  I have type-1 diabetes, but I do love good food and good comfort food.  Don't worry, I still regulate my carbs & insulin to accomodate what I'm eating (Mike O. of Park Ridge, I'm looking at you!).  But I also have one little oddity (okay, one oddity out of many).  After I get over being sick, my appetite kicks into overdrive and I wanna eat.    So after being down for the count with a bad cold over Easter weekend, and taking yesterday off to recuperate, I came here for lunch today.  I wanted a hotdog ('cos sometimes ya know, a girl's just gotta have one).  But I took one look at the kielbasas and my mind was made  up!
2	IxgHQLlLPKaMZP4Xzn0lBg	Apparently they have now discontinued the jalapeno rings and now have jalapeno poppers - which are not stuffed peppers. They are cheddar-cheesy stuffing with chopped up peppers in them. Not bad...but not the rings. Bring back the rings!  But they still have Inferno sauce...and the occasional shrimp tacos are good.
2	whnnLG9MgCG4M9QJgByg	Oh how I miss the days when China Village was good. Don't even bother going here now. The meat is hard to chew threw, the fryer way too hot, and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce. The orange chicken was the dish I always got, but the poor thing as been reduce to a plate of grizzly, overly deep fried, dog meat with some orange sauce on top. Trust me. Don't waste your money here. I'm actually surprised they are still open!
4	xtfmUQmWiDV9A8gC6wkCZA	I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the "fine" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent.
2	QzOgQ61GP0OXfYJckYzuKw	They should call this place Eclectic Earth Cafe.  I came here for a sandwich.  I ask the barrista to male me  his favorite.  He makes me a fancy named sandwich that was just a ham and cheese plus cream cheese.  Cheeses were more than double the ham.  The rye tasted more like old wonderbread than rye.  Awful.  Wi-fi was sporadically on and off,  even though the place wasn't busy.  I have to give them some credit.  A couple comfy couches and nice lighting with florecent bulbs.  Half a wall has a funky mural.
4	avOT9VythFjlOfNod0hw	Month we went-May 2009.  Out to dinner with a friend and we had a delightful time. Our waitress, Sharona (I kid you not), was friendly and very helpful. She saw me perusing the margaritas and spoke about a couple of them. Our drinks arrived with the chips and salsa. I love that there were 2 little pots of salsa, one for each of us, as we love salsa. The margarita was a 9 out of 10 limes! We ordered a sampler of appetizers, and it was very good. I ordered a combo that included a chile relleno (I love chile rellenos). Our dinners arrived in a timely yet not too quick manner. This gave us time to work on our appetizers as well as have some great conversation. We didn't finish the appetizer as we were afraid we'd be too full to eat our dinners. My combo was hot and tasty. Sharona was a great waitress. She was knowledgeable without being pretentious. She gave us a take out container for our uneaten appetizers and we were on our way. All in all, this was such a relaxing dinner.
2	7GUpgEJm6KaRnrYIviSP3g	I only went to this restaurant because island style was closed for remodeling. I have seen this place a couple of times and decided to give it a try. Im glad i did because now i know never to frequent this restaurant again. I don't care what this place looks like from the outside I'm strictly rating their food and service. First off my wife and i had to request the lunch menu, its not offered. The service was ok my problem was mainly with the food. Chinese food should be bold flavors with fresh vegetables and vibrant colors. This was none of the above. I had the pork and tofu hot pot. Again just plain and boring, plenty of pork and iceberg lettuce?!  Also ordered the shrimp pan fried noodles...very bland and just wasn't very good. Being a chef myself i can imagine that the chefs here just don't care anymore. All in all a very underwhelming experience, nothing special about the service, and absolutely nothing good about the food. I will probably never return
2	HaSQRHepY25npehH1x8w	Don't understand what is so great about fuddruckers. Hamberger was ok. Yeah they do have lots of options but quite honestly so does Cook Out! And they are cheaper! My husband, myself and preteen daughter ate there for $30! I felt ripped off.
4	9Zz0LKhyKLEUXLXRaXRPw	Love this place! The food is always good. But the service isn't the same.  Most of the times I've been there the service was excellent and there was a couple times the service was horrible.   Their garlic fries are very yummy and they're bottomless!
2	KKU0CPNC04Ql9I7K7LgupA	We had a horrible experience several weeks ago.  I ordered 14-ounce Rib Eye dinner.... what I got what looked just like my dinner companion's steak in the 8-oz sirloin/(shrimp) dinner. A 14-oz Rib Eye is obviously a good-size steak. They tried to say it just shrunk.  The second Rib Eye was not much better perhaps 10-11-oz. But the worst part was that the second steak was so grizzly that it was mostly inedible. I actually took pictures of it just in case Outback HQ was interested. No reply from email to their customer service. What a disgrace all the way around.   I have eaten at Outback Steakhouses all over the US on business for many, many years.... Lately, they have gone progressively "down hill" in quality and service.  This particular place was empty on a Saturday night... always a good sign to stay away.  While the manager did remove the charge from our bill, the dinner was a bad experience. I can only guess that Outback provides the quality of meat from their corporate level.  We ended up buying nice steaks from a local market the next day and cooking them ourselves at home.  If we wish to have road-kill we can certainly find lots of cheap horrible cuts of steak in the local discount stores.  Outback should be ashamed.  Be warned....
4	H3qhgCNV6vrVghed4BbZpg	Yikes, talk about angry reviews. I've usually had a great experience at this location. The greeters are always friendly and seemingly want to be there. The service is relatively fast and the food is zesty and delicious. We usually order the 2-for-20 and enjoy guacamole dip and salsa before our entrees. It's a great deal. The servers are always friendly and there's never a wait. Really no complaints on my end!
2	2HZxWoMMQopUNyzXibtug	*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba. It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.   The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.   The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies. The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.   *pffffffffffffft*
4	swSzPxOOjhJSw6N1OZXrA	I saw Lousianne's on the news one night.  So I took my boyfriend there for our date night.    We were extremely underdressed for the occasion.  A co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway.  Good news is, it had dim lightening.  We had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated.  I'm a vegetarian, so I tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak.  We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than I expected.  It had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it.  The entrees were good, I wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and I wish I would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya.  We topped off the meal with the White chocolate mousse  for dessert.  It was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off.  I would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters.   The service was great, our waitress was timely.  She checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave.
4	zyrExuVjuGnAJ4BT89eQ	This place is so much better than Subway. It has a nice college style atmosphere on the inside; with a pin ball machine and various arcade games. The subs are excellent and are relatively inexpensive. My favorite is the meatball and the super duper.
4	YevVHCclPDVcWxNBLVc8g	Being from Arizona and working in Southern California I grew up eating Jack in the Box.  Too bad Virginia doesn't have them!  Anyway, I already knew some cities in North Carolina have my favorite fast food restaurant!  So, I purposely planned my road trip route just to get my Jack in the Box fix!  Ordered a couple of Meat Lovers breakfast burrito's (with no egg, of course) and a good ol' Jumbo Jack with cheese.  Customer service was great and so was the food!  More details coming soon!
4	n7H45nL4dLhGyB8XGPfPQ	This time around in AZ I made my second trip to this Bar. Enough TV's and enough sports to keep everyone happy. I dug this spot because as well as offering sports in the bar area they have a nice little lounge with sofas and big screen's to enjoy the weekend games. Along with these little comforts you can also get a pool table and the tables aren't in the middle of the mix so they don't get in the way of the people there just to drink and enjoy the games.   Funny story i was greeted by the AZ PD as I left the build and after 5min of trying to convince me to a take a sobriety test it was a good night. Being from LA I found it hard that police would give you a sobriety test for fun. I had to make it clear I wasn't driving and I knew I was drunk they explained they offered this as a service so people would understand that they may leave a bar thinking there good to drive but if they were to be pulled over what their alcohol content would actually read. So after I blew a .13 I felt I had to remind them that I wasn't driving. They laughed and sent me on my way with my DD. Good times. The police get one star.
4	oxbSuVEs0SbA2u8XZUE4g	A nice surprise in the middle of nowhere!  The staff was very friendly and same (middle of the road) quality that you would expect from a Denny's.  If I am every starving after trekking across the Arizona desert again, I would return!
4	8eZtaCXAlzfuULXefjocQ	Tasty place!  Fresh dishes with combinations that are delicious and healthy.  Decor is fun, hippy chic.  Parking is definitely their weakest link, but the yummy food and casual atmosphere makes up for it.
4	tGJipZzRM2hxT7bqjT06w	The Merry-Ann's at Neil and Kirby is a standby.  I use to live near there and my neighbor and I would go there every Sunday morning.  The regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted.  It is the typical greasy spoon and I love it for that.  Got the t-shirt.  I've moved and have yet to find that certain place that gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that a omelette or diner's stack from Merry-Ann's can provide.  Forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door.  I think the one downtown is okay, but because I heart the original so much, the dt one will never compare.
2	0PZ8Ngu7HYstW12BBbO8wQ	This place is way too expensive for the mediocre food served to you.  It's not bad, but certainly not worth the price or the hype.  T cooks needs to take cooking lessons, and an introductory course in pricing strategy at a respectable business school.  If you're going to push a premium price, it better be a premium product.
2	2uUeXOUKAwepQSW6kC4n3g	We had the Hawaiian pizza the other night. I gave it two stars only because it was ready on time.  It was the 18 inch, but did not have enough cheese or anything else to be the smallest size.  The crust was  one of the worst I have ever had. I grew up in Chicago; this was advertised as a Chicago style pizza.Except for the checkerboard cutting, no way! Worst of all, it cost almost $20!
2	LkvH5CGd1E5qfMI1hGiXbQ	LOVE SONIC! But not a fan of this one. Unfortunately it's the closest to my job. They almost every time I go, take sooo long to bring your order. Once i waited in the drive thru 18 minutes for a shake! Also hate how they don't mix the slushy drinks well. My opinion is they need to be faster and more about customer service.
2	SHmj7IJX3RRsvbYQ6x34g	NO AMBER ALE??? NO AMBER ALE!!!  Wow, okay. And you call yourself a bar. Your Web site boasts all these beers you offer, on tap or by the bottle. What a f'n joke. Oh, I get it. Is this another prank? Seems to be the worst one possible. I mean, sure, you offer plenty of make-me-puke domestics to satisfy any obese truck driver, but what about little ol' me who's just looking for a nice amber to enjoy during HH?   I was snubbed.   This place is pretty large, I'll give 'em that. There's plenty of TVs to watch, while you nosh on cheap (and I do mean cheap!) apps during HH. My friend and I split the veggie tray (huge!) and Cajun chicken sliders on mini-croissants. (Good but kind of plain and dry.) The RED SEOX game was on a huge TV screen. Very cool! There wasn't any sound on during any of the games, until it was time for the Suns to play. Then most of the TVs went to that game and the sound came on. So, NOTE TO SUNS FANS: This could be a very good place to watch a game, while enjoying traditional bar food and a brewski (or several).  The patrons are what I'd call mostly "blue collar." Nothing wrong with that. They are some of the hardest working people, who are friendly and offer the best tips. I grew up around these kinds of folks. I felt pretty comfortable here, but I was with a friend. I highly doubt I'd venture here solo, for nothing screams "open hunting season" like a young, pretty girl sitting at the bar by herself. And I couldn't say, "Oh, I came for the amber ale..." Blue Collar Chilvary isn't the same in Phoenix as it is in Oklahoma... (trust me on this one)  Moving on...  Service was great. We had three attentive servers check on us during our short HH stay. My friend and I split a mini-pitcher of Blue Moon for $5. Yeah, I told you this place was cheap. If we had a DD, I'm sure we could have polished off another $10 worth!  Between 2 apps and 1 mini-pitcher AND tip, I spent around $13 here. Maybe that makes me cheap? I'd prefer to think of it as frugal.  While this place offers TVs galore and even a separate area for games (arcade-style included), I didn't find much about this place that would warrant a return trip. It would be a fun place for a group of friends to hit up during HH (if you're frugal like me and want to get alot of bang for the buckaroo) to order mini-pitchers ($5!), while challenging each other to various game competitions. Will the Real Big Dog please stand up?   I can't believe they didn't have an Amber Ale... They did offer two Hefs and an array of others, including Kiltlifter for those who like your local red ale. But - GASP - while the place was decorated with all types of beer merchandise and empty 6-pack boxes adorned the tables with condiments, Prankers Too did not offer any Sam Adams. NONE!   There went Plan B... (grumble, grumble)  So, no Amber Ale. No Sam Adams.   One more strike, and you're out of here!
4	Lliesx9kl3LXOHqqnp0LQ	I was starving and had to grab something really quick so I ran into this Caseys. This is a really nice Casey's, either that or I have not been to a Casey's in such a long time I forgot what they are like.  Years ago I used to order pizza on a regular basis from Casey's but I haven't done that in years.  I picked up a slice to go with a little cup of chocolate chip cookies and a water.  All for $5!!  The pizza was hot and really good.  The little chocolate chips cookies were excellent too.  It's OK to once in while eat something totally and all around bad for you at lunch isn't it?  The people working in here were super friendly too!!
4	Qg9LmovESpmk2ForC1pliw	Okay, my review sums it all up in a text that I sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a Frisco Burger w/o tomato, small order of curly fries and a small diet coke. Text message: "Don't tell anyone but I ate at Hardee's today and it was like real restaurant quality. Well just the food part. I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later."  I was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was. Mind you, I was totally alone. And I didn't go in the restaurant but it looked clean from the drive-thru window and that woman who took my order did a better than average job. I was kind of put off by their prices but it was totally worth every penny!
2	j7cjli6YYcXGW8IW8mXw0Q	First off, a heads up. Though the business is listed here as Salsa's, it's now actually Cabo's.   I stopped here spur of the moment for takeout lunch and ended up ordering the Chicken Taco Salad. It wasn't exactly what I was used to--the black beans and chicken were both hot. I prefer my taco salad cold because lettuce with really warm food is a little gross, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge to cool down before eating more.   I'll give them credit for the serving size (and the chips made for a nice snack later on). However, I wasn't overly impressed with the service. I was charged for the dinnertime salad rather than the lunch one (keep in mind I came in at 1PM), but the guy at the counter wouldn't admit to it. What happened to the mantra, "The customer is always right?" I'm no Albert Einstein, but just eyeballing the receipt (and with the help of my handy calculator), it wasn't hard to figure out that I was.  Ok, ok...time to cool off! All in all, I was only charged $1.00 extra, but it was a complete turnoff that the Cabo employee wasn't being honest and tried to make up a mysterious extra charge.
4	iaoteoW4bFjZSzyNESd46w	Long wait for to go food on the weekends. An hour today from call in to food ready.   Cashiers are always very friendly.    Restaurant is noisy. People talk loudly in there for some reason, even though the cooking is quieter than the loud customers talking when they should be eating.  Love that the food is made fresh, thus the extra wait.    Sometimes they put rice stix in the lettuce wrap meat when I request them to be left out, but they resolve the problem quickly and without trouble at all.    I always order online ahead to avoid waiting after ordering in store.  I wish they had their own stock, separate from PF Chang's, because Pei Wei's are always packed no matter the location it seems.  Weekends, forget about it, lines are long and they even stop taking orders while they wait for people to leave to free up tables.  Just remember to be patient if you plan to eat in when it's busy.
2	SJz1W0pMub6AzjnVwFUw	I'm a native San Franciscan, so of  course I've been to Crustacean and Thanh Long in San Francisco. Both restaurants are to die for, but this location's food is nothing like either one. I went to Vegas about 3 years ago for a friend's birthday, so of course we had to check out the place. We ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles. The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab. Plus it was a tad bit more expensive. The location was nice, though. We decided to order a bottle of wine and just made the best out of the evening.
2	Z3tFkaM8R6k4ryQZPdJNA	Went there for NYE at the early set for Candy Foster.  He was the best part of the visit.  Ashley our server was good.  I ordered the scallops and could not eat them as they were raw and only barely grilled.  The sprouts had been warm at onetime but were also cold.  My friend ordered the duck and it was good.  It was a very expensive meal for something I could not eat.  Next time a salad for me.  I only went for the music and I guess that's what I got:(
2	pLrP0jOt2EddpTL92rqOQ	I'm not sure why I'm even reviewing this,  but the drive-through service was pretty bad....as always.  I'm giving this 2 stars because it is to be expected at McDonalds and yet I still continue to get my iced coffee there....otherwise I'd give it 1.
2	3fOKVgZj5cNOalTGjjXSHA	I've been here a few times for a quick bite and am not impressed.   You are going to end up paying Chili's price for a burger, but with drive-thru quality. If they toast your bun, consider yourself lucky. If your fries are hot, consider yourself lucky. If your burger fix-ins aren't spilled out all over your plate like a gutted pig when you get it, consider yourself lucky.  This joint definitely needs to work on quality and consistency.
2	pAdQ4LCOcziX89Dk91mVwg	In our never-ending search for Sunday brunch, we found that Charlotte has added another competitor: The Neighborhood Grille.  That's the good news.  The selection isn't bad, but it's not extensive by any means.  Like most of the other places, the items on the bar include breakfast or other items, so you can choose what you'd like to eat.  Hint: Go with breakfast.  If you want lunch, you will probably be disappointed.  The breakfast selection is easily the largest, and includes eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, waffles, french toast, breads and fruits.  The non-breakfast items consisted of wings and soup.  Yes, that's it.  It's not that they were bad, it's just that there weren't a lot of them - so if you don't want breakfast, you may be disappointed.  The price isn't the most expensive in town, but it's not the cheapest either, and considering that you don't get a ton of items on the bar, it might seem a bit more expensive than what you're getting, as you are essentially paying for breakfast.  Admittedly, you do get to go back as much as you want, but you can do that at Shoney's too.  Just something to keep in mind.
4	hqyGKGwDgFmw0Fpd2lQtA	A reliable haven right in the middle of downtown.  Well designed and attractive interior, excellent service and good food always - very well prepared and presented.   A great place for the business traveler looking for fine food and a nice dining experience.
4	4xmR86x6rOkR1tWQigYm7g	Really great Mexican food local hole in the wall. The beans and rice are fantastic, and the tortillas are homemade and amazing. I have had the chicken tacos and found the meat a little bland, but had the Carne Asada the next time and it was very good.   Can get crowded at lunch! I always call ahead and go pick it up so I can get back to work.
2	ZrOQzqmp8ew3OXVJVkJSw	Very disappointed. I hadn't visited Texas Roadhouse in several years and it will be many more before or if we return. I ordered the trio tenderloins cooked medium. All three came cooked differently ranging from rare to medium well. The peppercorn seasoning ordered was non existent. The Long Island Tea tasted like liquid hairspray and was refused without substitution. We were never offered peanuts.
2	sPl7G4FyayahEePydfOkrQ	This Mexican place is located on and/or near a golf course...? Possibly a retirement community? That is the clientele for sure. It is kind of like a diner in a Midwest town that attracts the olds to have coffee and eat really bland Mexican food at "that one thar Mex-ee-can" place.  The tables have no hot sauce on them. HUH?  The menu does not feature burritos. HUH?  I had an a la carte chicken burrito that didn't come with ANYTHING. No salsa. No sour cream. No guac. HUH?   I mean, I get that I ordered it a la carte, but not even a dollop of sour cream? Makes you go hmmm. The chicken was sub-standard and didn't have much of a sauce in it. As I sat there eating it I was envisioning a Chipotle burrito I could have gotten for a dollar less and it would have been a thousand times better.  Maybe I should have ordered something different, but for a place called "El Burrito" I was shocked there was not a plethora of burritos to choose from.  I say go to Chipotle over this place if you want EL BURRITO.   PS - While I was there the US Foodservice truck pulled up and made a delivery. I knew this because he had an employee fill out a form and I watched him get in his truck and drive away. US FOODS you GUYZ. YIKESES.
2	Eti2lDIUScYMQgLSyGOXA	Noodles & Company...universally loved, almost.  I say almost because there seems to be an attitude among foodies that this chain sucks.  I, personally, don't think it sucks, but it could be a lot better.  The main problem with this location is the size of the restaurant itself.  It would probably get three stars from me if not for this problem. There is simply not enough seating to accommodate the amount of people who want to eat here on weekends.  I'm not a fan of waiting for tables unless the restaurant is REALLY good, so I've just walked out a few times before placing my order.  When I do stick around, usually I feel really crowded due to the close proximity of the tables.  There are also lots of little kids, who may or may not leave you teetering precariously on the brink of utter madness.  It's probably better to go during the work-week.  The food is reasonably tasty and quickly served, but inconsistent.  The noodles are always cooked perfectly but sometimes the sauces come out too watery.  The ability to add meat (or tofu) to any dish is helpful, since some of the dishes are pretty bland otherwise.  My favorite recently has been the penne rosa, which has just the right amount of kick.  However, for a place devoted to pastas, and considering the rather high prices, I expect to be more impressed.  You probably already know if you like Noodles & Company or not. If you aren't familiar with this chain and are thinking of trying it out, I would not recommend this location; there are quite a few others in the Madison area which are less crowded.  For a quick bite, Noodles is pretty good, but you can do better.
2	UyYganXizCmZ6RndUe2Ew	Two stars are for the adorably sweet and energetic waitress.  The other missing three are for the less than sub par food. Which really bums me out, because I have experienced nothing but deliciousness at the Desert Ridge location.  The normally wonderful grilled cheese (that I had been craving all day) was nothing more than two crusty pieces of toast with some burnt cheese around the edges.  And the boyfriend's mac and cheese was a whole lot of macaroni and pretty much no cheese. However like I said the service was really good and fast too.  Yard House, I'm not giving up on you yet.  Just giving up on this location.
4	oK2WKZM67M5eJshGIT6AQ	This is the one I call the "Other" Jordan's. Not because it is any worse, only because it isn't the one I grew up eating at.  This Jordan's is downtown, along a little strip of restaurants including the Caddy Corner, Durant's, and Thaiger. And the food here is slightly different from the other Jordan's, but just as good.   The service here is quicker but more in tune with a lunch crowd, since most of their customers pop in from neighboring office buildings. It is very dark inside but it serves as a nice respite in the summertime when the sun glares at such absurd temperatures.   They have some lunch specials that aren't available at the 7th street location, and even some deviations from traditional mexican fare like ham and cheese sandwiches or burgers. My recommendation is to dance with the fella that brought you, so don't stray too far from the tacos and enchiladas.
4	HUknZzWqOuXz84tksY3Q	I enjoy this place everytime I go in there. Its family owned and has consistently good food. Large soda selection with  awesome crab rangoon. My favorite dish is the Happy family which has beef, pork, chicken, crab, and veggies in brown sauce.
2	E2EtKCEMiAGlInXhukQrgg	Well the pizza here is good. It is always fresh and hot. Best fast food pizza around. But the service was terrible!!! Took almost 2 hours to get my delivery and let me tell you I was not happy about that. They need more delivery drivers and maybe a better management team. I mean it's just pizza people.
4	cCWzn0gwmFZpmWk3p1xqbQ	I have been here a few times for lunch. The food is good and the prices are also. I was pleasantly surprised by a salad of all things. It was a soup and salad combo that i ordered. The ingredients were fresh and i was able to choose what i wanted on it and the broccoli cheese soup was also very good. It is a nice convenient and quick little lunch spot.
2	cytEwO7XmCQGFOYYkCnyw	Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?
4	rWS27NrnQUazYetG5Q5g	I can't believe this place doesn't have more reviews! There is something so satisfying about buying an Isaly's chipped chopped ham sandwich right from the source. The sandwiches I bought here were so good and wow I can't believe I'm raving about something as simple as a ham sandwich but man it was memorable. This is seriously one of the last remaining Isaly's locations so it really should draw more attention than it does. Unfortunately no Klondike bars (they were invented by Isaly's) because apparently Isaly's lost the naming rights to Klondike bars or so I heard. Get the chipped chopped ham!
2	kThsqnf3SBPS4bTh4y51A	Bangkok Balcony is a nice spot, but it isn't the best Thai in town.  The tables are a little cramped, but if you're by the window you can enjoy the view of Forbes Ave.  The price is decent, but I don't think I've been able to get in and out in a decent amount of time.  Between waiting for a table and the slow orders expect to be there a while.
4	J6OPKjnG9syAq9mD1Rw	I have been going to this place for the last 7 years or more. It is what you expect for cheap Chinese food. It is even referred to by my wife a "The Cheap Chinese Place". The Sweet and Sour Pork is a staple. The egg rolls are awesome and the Ice Tea is cold.. most of the time. The "To Go" Order is an amazing amount of food for the price. I highly recommend this place for a try. Don't go in expecting the best but it's better than most.
4	gRpi2ANbb2OFODZTg1glQg	Worth a visit just for the rotisserie chicken. It is awesome! It's the kind of chicken that after you finish your serving, you keep picking at it to try to find a little speck of goodness that you left behind, just hoping you weren't thorough.   The owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Always a nice touch. The other staff members seem equally friendly.   My only issue is that the menu seems a bit schizophrenic - like they can't decide exactly what kind of restaurant they want to be. For example, the mac and cheese is Kraft. Why even serve it? Stick with what you do best - chicken and Latin influenced meals and sides.   Go though, try it - you won't regret it, just stick with what seems logical on the menu.
4	jV7PKR4glfv4eHOe28DX3Q	We live 5 mins away and we've driven by sooo many times, but we've never been in. Let me say that I am so glad we corrected our mistake. We stopped in to order the 14' cheese pizza and it was wonderful!  It was as close to pizza from NY without going to the NYC. They also have a great 2 pizza slice and drink lunch special.
2	8SPtgtKBuOf04u0TD3EJGw	What is it about the anonymous Chinese buffet that draws me, like a moth to a flame, knowing full well that I will be disappointed?  I suppose the 2 or 3 good experiences I have had, ever, at any Chinese buffet, anywhere, have spawned within me an eternal optimism - that I will stumble into a beautiful buffet table full of home-cooked Chinese food, tasty and tasteful.  In reality, it seems that 98% of Chinese buffets serve the same stock dishes, with varying levels of mediocrity.  The orange chicken here was actually tasty; everything else was greasy, super salty, and, sometimes, lukewarm.  There were about 8 dishes total, with the usual fried accouterments, plus the worst sushi I have ever had in my entire life.  If you are desperate and pressed for time, this place will do - otherwise, avoid, and spend your $7 somewhere else.
2	S4HVyImRMoewOkEJppD15A	The casual buffet at Cafe Lago in Caesar's Place is nothing special. For $22 you can get a variety of mediocre food. The desserts are decent, but everything else is disappointing or at best unremarkable. At least the decor is decent, and the live piano was a nice touch.
4	ZhfPXDTEyzgww1yPEjk4g	My fiance's parents were in town from Pennsylvania, and I thought this would be a fun place for dinner. Yes, it's a bit touristy - but the food was delicous and there was great live music. I was also impressed by their beers on tap - they even had one that was made in house that we really liked. If you're looking for a fun, out of the ordinary, night out - this is your place! It's more fun if you get into character - so be sure to wear your boots and cowboy hat!
2	vXaLj2KAq8gjidEMCMuHQA	Stopped by this restaurant the other day thinking I had found a fast Chinese joint nearby, and was disappointed.   I was greeted when I walked in but then was ignored for almost 10 minutes even though I was at the counter and ready. The cashier even answered a phone call before even asking me what I would like to eat. 10 minutes isn't usually a big deal, but usually in that amount of time I am asked right away if I'd like a few minutes or not before ordering.  After ordering, I waited in a booth. It didn't take very long but I did notice that the place needed cleaning, but since it was my first time there, I don't know if it always looks like it needs to be cleaned (walls, divider, floors, everything).   The cashier let me know it was ready, and seemed to be kind at that moment, so I tipped them a dollar and took my food to go.   I ordered the chicken and broccoli, which came with fried rice, chow mein, and egg drop soup. Overall the meal was okay, I probably won't visit again unless I want to just stay near home for Chinese food.
2	B4qeuG00DJHKURxVFN8qA	Oh my! Tried this place for the first time tonight - will not be going back. Egg drop soup - not good, egg rolls - not good, General's Chicken - worst I've ever had. The broccoli in the entree smelled bad, it was the first time I've ever had General's Chicken with a deep red coating on the chicken and no sauce. Heck - I didn't even get a fortune cookie - what kind of Chinese place is this. The prices were good compared to other Chinese places but it really doesn't matter if the food isn't any good.
4	hczclyDbjmUkDcVuPKs6mQ	Dragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again.   The egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious.   We also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good.   I have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all.   They do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive.   Dragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable.
4	YuY8MA5BaDpXROleb0RI2g	Johnny Rocket's is a mix between a 5&Diner and an In and Out Burger with a dash of Ed Debevic's (May it rest in peace).    Great burgers with good looking fresh ingredients.  Shakes that are out of this world.  But I've never seen one that wasn't in the mall. This particular location is in Arizona Mills and it's a pretty good sized location.  Not one of the largest ones, but it has counter and booth seating.  Though, like many other locations, during peak times you can expect to see a line forming outside.  We've stood in line before - just for a shake to go.    At this mall one of the other advantages here is that this isn't a part of the official food court.  It's pretty much on the other side of the mall.  So if you're there and hunger strikes - you don't have to walk to the other side of the mall.  And in this mall, that could take you awhile - longer with kids, even longer with window shopping friends.    By the way - they have Boca burgers and Turkey burgers.  You want an egg on it?  They can make that happen.  They also have other sandwiches - from a grilled cheese to a Philly.  I suggest ending it all with a Hot Fudge sundae.    And after all that, you'll want to do a few laps of the mall just to breathe again of course.   So if you need to leave soon, make sure at least one person in your party has some restraint.  Let them get a salad.  The rest of you will be too deep in a food coma to be trusted behind the wheel.
2	jD0uxzbC60nEqkdqnN7QYQ	I liked the diner-y atmosphere and the unpretentiousness a lot.  I didn't like the coffee being served in styrofoam cups.  The food has to be good if you're going this route, and the breakfasts we had this weekend were not good.  They were just barely OK.  Hence the two stars.  Wish it could have been more.
4	XHMr4SZ2LSK5Z8K90jwQ	Staff here is great... I think that makes it so much better for dining experiences.  I haven't run into any of the managers yet...   I'm so used to the old sckool you get the food at the counter and bring it to your table, I'm still a little uncomfortable with them bringing it to us... they still manage to do it with a long line, which makes it that much nicer... but I could go either way.  This location is near my office so... I try to go for breakfast and a late lunch.... it gets super busy right around lunch time so I just avoid the rush.
2	4Io7qseEX8yorn3mj6hECA	Picked up some Port-O yesterday and ordered my usual #5 smoked turkey, ham and cheese.  The bread unfortunately was a little stale and they barely put any meat on it.  I never really had any issues when I've been to other locations.  Anyways, I ordered the combo with chips and a drink.  The soda machine is like this crazy handy dandy futuristic machine that looks like it would be able to grab the cup out of your hand, fill it up and say thank you have a nice day.  Pretty cool.  With three people working, the customer service lacked a little bit of friendly but hey all I want is a sandwich and go -not any big conversations anyway.
4	Mvyc0YqnPjypJupIkcOjQ	I got my first visit to the Coronado Cafe last night, and loved it.  I can see how it could be a bit claustrophia-enducing when it's a little more crowded, but luckily we had a little room to ourselves.  I really adored everything about the look and feel of the place.  They had a good sized wine list, and a few girly drinks.  I was torn between 2 wines, and asked the waiter if he had a preference.  I'm pretty sure he made up an answer on the spot, but I give him points for pulling it off smoothly.   Seeing as how I just was incapable of making a decision and just wanted him to act as my coin toss, I was perfectly happy to choose the one he selected, and it was very, very yum.  I had the most delicious salmon, although I can't quite remember how it was prepared.  I only know that I wanted to eat it forever.  My date had a steak that he said was very good as well (yelp it yourself, mister!)  We didn't have dessert... I would have loved to because they looked amazing, but I was stuffed to the gills already.  I actually have the feeling that it would be a really ideal place to just order dessert and wine/coffee, and linger until they hate you, and I will try that soon.
2	h2CZr3jKN1uUpko7ES6Sw	REALLLLYYY salty food.I mean i love salty food but this is beyond! Me and my fiance both Had a stomach ache couple hour after eating there.should of give a one star but only good thing bout this place is the service. Not going back there again or any red lobster!
4	e6j2xGxEuOqEsBfnpP8g	Dilly's Deli is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations. They use Boar's Head meat and the bread is crisp and fresh. The deli offers a plethora of sandwich combos. I recommend the Honey Do (turkey, tomato and cheddar cheese with alfalfa sprouts and honey mustard). I've never had anything I didn't like at Dilly's. Their salads are hearty. Be sure to try the Greek salad. They're cookies are delightful and I love the large, zesty pickles. They also serve delicious bread bowls, which are huge. My favorite is the Wisonsin Cheese.   Dilly's is a no-frills lunch and dinner hangout. It's usually filled with college students and young professionals. I recommend getting there at 1 p.m. if you go for lunch because there's usually a line out the door after Noon.
4	WCHow3XVU1p98IghNBGg	We;ve all seen the lines around the holidays when people are waiting to pick up their hams for a holiday dinner.  Well, they have cafe's as well, and their sandwiches, soups and salads are wonderful.  If you are looking for a great place for lunch, try it! It's delicious!
2	fIUz7bxjC59DCfS3vRfjw	It was a great restaurant before the recent  overhaul in decor, it looks bland and generic. Food has also changed, used to be you couldn't find a bad item now it's spotted with mediocre offerings, they must of changed either recipes or chefs.  Don't go by previous rep it's totally different now.
4	C4gpNPcwPRT7Pd3Dh1247A	Unlimited hot coffee. I don't have any recollection of what I ate....  I wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal I cannot recall.  I know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in Deforest.  For that, I give it four stars.
4	opvBJHe6704mLiNEH9Fyrg	Just had breakfast there on a Sunday morning. The wait wasn't bad and the hostess was really organized. Once we sat down our server was friendly and quick with our drinks landfills. I got the breakfast burritos Andy friend the veggie Benedict. Both were good. The only thing we were a little disappointed about was that the hashbrowns were a little bland. They were cooked perfectly but just needed a little more flavor.
2	KeU9Xqpq82bhtIiEPOw	We heard that have great burritos, so we were in the area, so decided to stop.  Customer service was ok, and the burritos were a little below a 3, probably a 2.5  .  I got a green chili burrito and Megan got a carne asada burrito.  Mine was ok, a little bit overfloured.  Too much thickening, not enough meat.  Megan's carne was dry.  Would I ever stop here again, no
2	xSYxOlJTstdRAYqr5WQ	Sunday am Hung Over needing to eat like now. The kids wanted bagels and this was the closet place. I had been here years ago and was surprised to see it is still there.   The place was not too busy, there were seats available.   The staff was rude, Shelby the "manager" although cute could care less about taking my order. She had pressing issues and had to explain how to mop or sweep or what ever the other dude was doing. I obviously should have waited until they were done. LOL   The bagels were squished flat like a pancake, although good flavor the thing looked like crap.   The Hot Choc was 700 degrees and they knew it was for a kid. It was watery until we realized it was because the Choc syrup was pooled in the bottom of the cup.   The frapachino thing was too sweet for a 13 year old to eat. She tossed over 1/2 of it.   The Dr Pepper was good. :)
4	zERbcRxRuaFunGIXj5pA1A	They give you bean dip with your chips and salsa here and sometimes that is the only reason why I choose to eat here. I heart chips and salsa! I have never had a bad meal here and the fish tacos are really good. After looking at all the other reviews I am obviously the minority when I say I heart Arriba!
2	03K6hr4fSG2rYaRk9kdQ	This has been our go to sushi restaurant for the last 9 years.  We rave about it to all our friends.  Unfortunately, last night was nothing to rave about.  The service was horrible, and we waited almost 2 hours for our sushi. The place was not even full, though to their credit , there was only 1 person making sushi and there is usually 2.   When we finally got our sushi, the rice and rolls just fell apart.  They were certainly was not the sushi we were used to.  Then there was a piece of Saran Wrap left on my sushi roll that almost made it into my mouth.  When i told the waitress she just smiled and said ok, thank you.  She had no clue what i was trying to tell her.
2	eGiKhmByNBkjYLja6fow	I usually stay away from fast food, but I happened to be working in the area and was too lazy to drive further away for lunch.  Upon entry there was a BK employee on break eating BK food, always an encouraging sign when employees eat company food. Customer service was friendly, unfortunately that was about all that was good. $7.80 on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings. Food was below average although not terrible. What really brought this rating down was cleanliness, it seemed as though no matter where I sat a group of nats or a fly or two were sure to follow! That and the seats looked like they haven't been wiped down in days.  Now that I think about it, the last time I enjoyed BK was when I was a kid and my friends and I were in San Diego staying by the beach, we'd grab the original chicken sandwiches at night.   Bottom line: Don't bother with this place, if you're in the area just go a bit further east and you will find much better places in Chinatown.  Customer service = 4 stars. Food =2 stars. Atmosphere = N/A Cleanliness = 1 star. Final = 2/5 stars. (based on a fast food place)  Total cost of experience = $7.80 What it felt like it should cost = $2.50
2	KqWxDAuEOyyRBvRZK9DA	How good can the review be...it's a franchise sub shop.  Non of them really make a "great" sub but then again I'm a little biased as I've had many "hoagie's" while visiting the east coast.  My only complaint about this place is the last time I checked they are not open in the evenings.  If you're going to build a location in what some people consider (wrongly) a less than desirable location then have the balls to keep it open with the SAME business hours as your other locations.  When you restrict your hours because you are to afraid of your neighborhood you alienate me and I take my business ELSEWHERE. Don't let racism dictate your business hours because it certainly doesn't dictate where I spend my money and so far you haven't received much of it since you aren't open in the evenings like the rest of your entire chain of restaurants.
4	alamvWtb9KTOx8kyhX96Q	recently staying at preby downtown for my daughters birth i walked down to this deli on the second day of our stay to get us lunch. the hoogie was amazing. the bread was nice and soft and all the meat was top notch. boars head is a great brand and what i get at my local deli anyway but they had great toppings and choice of meats. also a wide selection of anti pasta and salads as well as burgers soups and so much more i would eat here again in a heartbeat. the food was 20 dollars for 2 hoogies two drinks and two bags of chips which also was a great selection of kettle and alot of the normals
2	0m37ZLCausS0gc6TYrcr2A	I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Domino's was bad, even for "fast food pizza" standards. Way too greasy, and it was definitely stale, old grease. Ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad. Cheese only was edible, but anything we had with toppings was bad. Not coming back.
4	vVYopYiLVKfHvauKGj2ldA	So for the monolingual, "Bahia de Guaymas" means "Guaymas Bay." Don't walk in expecting your typical Mexican steak fajitas, because unless you're coming for lunch this is a Mexican seafood restaurant. Can't speak for the seafood, but the lunch was great.  Very affordable - no lunch special more than $7. Salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. The meal itself was incredibly filling - I had a huge burrito and the wife had her typical cheese enchiladas. You can get whatever meal you ordered smothered in enchilada sauce for an extra 95 cents. The enchilada sauce is reminiscent of New Mexican chile sauce - sweet and spicy.  Music is a bit loud, I got up and discreetly turned it down at one point. As we left a mariachi band was walking in, sorry we missed out on that but we had to run. Overall the place has a low-key party atmosphere. Give it a shot if you're in the area!

As I read some of the low reviews, I have to laugh.  Umm...if you want to complain about the atmosphere, service, and hot and sour soup - go to PF Changs for expensive Chinese food.  Places like this are what usually are good indicators of authentic - I am Chinese so yes, I think I know what I am talking about.  What I got a big kick out of was the fact that they have a menu for those looking for americanized chinese food and then a separate one with the real stuff on it.  Hilarious!  Madi D seems to be spot on.  I ordered the Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) and Green Beans with XO sauce.  The rice is not your typical fried rice so don't expect anything else besides the salty fish (yum!) and chicken.  It was yummy and a comfort good.  The green beans were cooked with something that made them dif. so I suggest that again.  I spoke with the girl at the counter (mine was take-out) and she was really pleasant.  Overall, I'd need to try other things to be sure but so far, I am pretty sure this is the real deal.
4	tGjGBA0LDkZr57Yklf9gWQ	This is definitely a throw-back to little town diners. The food is basic, but well made and cheap. Really cheap. Nothing over $8 on the menu and most things in the $5-6 range for breakfast which is served all day. I recently went here on a weekday morning that I had off work and the place was mostly filled with older guys sitting around in groups drinking their coffee discussing the weekend football games. You can tell this is the type of place that people visit every day to chat with neighbors and have the community feeling. Service is prompt and efficient. On weekends there can be a short wait, but never anything too bad.
4	TSmqgksc67lavMaCCXXx0g	Good meal, good food.  Very good wait staff.  A wee bit expensive, but that was minor compared to the quality of the food and the apparent cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were amazed at the number of folks that kept streaming in for carryout.  Since we've never been to the restaurant, the locals must have already discovered this little gem.  I'd almost give it five stars, but would want to try other items on the menu first.
2	NHLIgjisghVu2qneWUFTwA	I have been wanting to try this place for awhile since I always drive by it on Scottsdale. Finally made it there with a girlfriend on Saturday night.    The service and ambiance were great, however the sushi was only mediocre.  First we had edamame, which was fine, it's pretty hard to mess that up! We then split the ungi roll and and the Stingray roll (which I think is  their signature roll because it was one of the most expensive).  The eel roll was good but the Stingray roll was way too spicy and nothing to write home about.  I have never gone out to sushi and had pieces left over, but we definitely did not finish the Stingray roll.      Anyways, Stingray seems like it would be a good place for  Happy Hour (it always looks happening when I drive by it during that time) but I wouldn't go here again for a sit down dinner. Stingray does have location on it's side though...... After dinner, the bars were just a few blocks away!
4	cRzqO3TiVJF0IUIt0mq4w	Nothing bad to say about this bagel shop. Def one of the prized cafes in fountain hills. I enjoy the bacon egg and cheese on an everything begal witha little honey mustard. Fresh fresh begals and delicious eggs! A must try if you are in the hills!
4	sWUfSaBsSaGo19ZQhdfzkw	I had the tuna salad here the other day and it was great.  Fresh and tasty.  I liked it so much, I took my out of town guest there for breakfast and that was pretty good too.  Friendly service and good food.
2	f53NoPABDSCHYaWE1vqIFQ	Most definitely a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar. Decor is very much dated, but the bartender, Debbie, is super nice and tends to her customers' every need. Food is ok, but not the best. Owner is rough around the edges, but extremely funny and carries a take shyte from no one attitude, but in a good way. Not my favorite place, but ok if you like dive bars.
4	ccImSQVTZZzEeKz3uLV4Pg	We went here one night. I think the primary reason was to try the "death" wings. Its a pretty chill bar/restaurant. There are peanuts on the floor, it reminds me of North Woods Inn, in so. cal.  Cheap drinks.  BTW, they do not lie about the death wings.
2	MyjfP8ykHpLDiqHF3UZoA	Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.  Oh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.    I was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.
4	dBZd6hlHztbhSmb2tcfytw	As has been noted by the other reviewers, China Restaurant (kudos for the creative name!) is CHEAP. If you've only got $5 for lunch, this is where you want to be.  The food is not very authentic (it's Americanized Chinese, what do you expect?), but it is very tasty. I make a point of trying something different every time, and I'm there 2-3x weekly. It's close to my work, and did I mention that's it's cheap? Most lunch combos are around $3.50, with dinners around $5. Dinner combos pile on the sides: wings, wontons, eggroll, and rice as well as a large entree. The quality of the food is surprisingly good, considering the price. Dine-in meals include a bowl of decent egg drop soup.  China Restaurant does accept credit cards. I work with the guy who convinced them to start taking plastic, and Cindy, the very friendly and efficient manager, agrees that this was a great move. So, all you non-cash-carrying people, you've got no more excuses to avoid the place.
2	FbNd6zn5poQRt5FlgeuWTw	I'm not a huge pizza fan, so my review may be a little biased based on my taste. But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie, & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.  I've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.  Once you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.  I'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.
2	691ZgBrPw1ObbUHFJeX5g	I would love to say I have had the pleasure of trying this local hot dog restaurant, but unfortunately they have no veggie dogs. The gentleman who took my phone call offered to put all their veggie toppings on a bun for me. While I appreciate the offer it was not what I was in search of. I hope you get some Veg friendly options soon, Dazzo's!
4	GCEDOhAAS39fkTRFzM4rxQ	A girlfriend of mine told that a few of them are getting together for some drinks and laughs and that I should join them, so off I went to meet up with them at Gallagher's. When I got there I knew I was lied too, this wasn't just about getting together and sharing come laughs.  Yep my friends were there, but there was no laughter, they were deep into their football games. They are some sport lovin chicks, but the cowgirls where losing (why did they expect it to be different) and they needed to drown there sorrows in beer, well not really I was the only one who ordered a beer, got me a Blue Moon, which was cold and great tasting!   I did order there bake potato, random thing to order I know, but I did. Ordered the veggie baker; it had bell peppers, onions, mushrooms & cheddar cheese. It was good. Also ordered a gooey chocolate chip cookie Sunday, oh man that was delish; a gooey warm cookie topped with ice cream & chocolate syrup, man that was sweet heaven!  Gallagher's had great service, and they have lots, I mean lots of TV's, you can catch whatever sporting activity your heart desires! It was a fun time with my friends.
4	SGyo4mUO260tUFN3XwQ	I have been to South Bank about half a dozen times now and this little hole is the wall is great for lunch. It's a little gem In an industrial area with not a lot of dining choices sans the JITB down the street.   The service is always quick and pleasant, prices reasonable, generous portion sizes and above average food. The Chipotle Steak Sandwich is the bomb! I also like the Albuquerque Turkey Sandwich. All sandwiches/entrees come with a side choice, the normal prefab frozen fries (always served hot), coleslaw, cottage cheese, etc. Daily lunch specials like Italian Beef Sandwiches and Friday Fish Fry are both excellent choices. A co-worker recently had the shrimp basket and she ate everything, fries, coleslaw and the huge breaded shrimp, said she would be ordering it again.   They have happy hour and televise UFC fights but I can't vouch for either.   If you work in the area give them a try for lunch it's a great little family run, neighborhood business serving good food.
4	Sl8r30n2FK2iJGPxERg	NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM  this is what happened to the tamales I bought from El Charro.   I would give 5 stars for the food deliciousness level, but i would give 3 stars for the wait.  I called in advance to carry out and I still had to wait 15 min just to pay.
4	8GAxasQSj97R5q6kBOzHhA	Atmosphere is very nice - quiet without feeling like a library, nice lighting, decent and eclectic music mix.  Service was excellent.  The clientele was mixed on Friday night - a couple with a child, two couples double-dating, people just getting drinks, etc.  Onto the food.  The Pacific Rim drink was fruity and not too strong, and also reasonably priced.  The crispy tofu appetizer is awesome.  If I lived closer, I would want it all the time.  The high crispiness level means it was probably deep fried, but it's so yummy I didn't even care. Spicy cucumber raita (amuse bouche) with flatbread was also delicious.  I kind of want a jar of it at home to put on sandwiches or something. As far as entrees, boyfriend had the beef brisket which he said was excellent and very tender.  I had the citrus tofu curry, which was just ok.  If I were a chef, I would have balanced out the very sweet citrus sauce with a little soy sauce or something savory.  The portions were more than big enough. And for dessert, we had the Vietnamese coffee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was beyond delicious.  I generally enjoyed the meal, but would appreciate maybe one more vegetarian entree to give diners a choice.  Also, a head's up: the adjoining parking lot is small, so if you have a reservation or are meeting people, make sure you allow time to find alternative parking if the lot is full.
2	gIo78aBBXNRnOftBQV8sA	I could not agree more with Adam C's review. The only cool thing about this place is that it doubles as a chinese-restaurant AND a saloon. There's a little corridor between the two.  Practically, it doesn't change anything though. It's really two separate places. If you have chinese food, you have it in the chinese restaurant. A very dark place, with no windows and little or no decorations. So much for the saloon atmosphere.  We went for lunch, and the place was relatively busy. There was only one waiter, a chinese man who couldn't muster English. He didn't look very busy, but it took him a full 5 minutes to acknowledge us and bring us the menus. Then, another full 10 minutes to come back.  We ordered two of the lunch specials: kung po chicken (pictured), and shrimp and vegetables. We asked for a soda, and water.   It took him about 5-6 minutes to come back with the soda and waters, and then another full 10 minutes to come back with the egg-drop soup. You'd think that if it's part of a lunch special and that everybody gets the same, they'd have it ready pretty quickly but no. Didn't taste like anything really.  Another full 15 minutes and we got our entrees. So much for a quick lunch meal! The kung po chicken one of the worst I've ever had. Heck, all the recipes I've tried at home were better. The sauce wasn't spicy at all, and it tastes like the brown sauce that you get on noodles, but not salty. The chicken was fine, but there were almost no vegetables. It was just a very very blend dish.  The shrimp and vegetables meal was average. We counted a total of 7 average-sized shrumps. There were plenty of vegetables in it, which was good. The sauce was a thick white sauce that was more or less flavorless. She ended up stealing my plate to get the sauce for her rice, because hers was even more blend than mine.  Once we were done, we tried to get the waiters attention as he hadn't even come back once to our table and we wanted the check. We had already been there for about an hour, but he was too busy clearing up the dishes and making lots of noise (the dishes were collected right by the entrance of the kitchen, in the dining area. Go figure why.).  In the end, we were very dissapointed. It was super close to our hotel, and we thought a small restaurant food where we could get cheap chinese food AND have a drink would be heaven. But the service was so sloppy, and the food was some of the most blend chinese food I've ever had.   We would never go back, but the place gets a second star just for offering a $4.75 lunch special a block off the strip.
2	tXqoxGuKdEg9lhDMJUGWw	Decent sandwich since I am normally a fan or Jimmie johns. However, this location has pretty slow service. Makes me wonder if its new staff on training? Ive been to this location about 6 times now and each time its been about the same. I order either the Beach club or the tuna salad club, both are very delicious. The only other complaint that I have is that my beach club and the hunter club that my friend get are thinner (less meat and filling wise) then what i am normally used to from other Jimmie Johns.
4	CJafm5ukEhrZxXuXcQxg	Best BBQ in the Phoenix Area, Move over Honey Bears and those fans of Stacy's.  "slow cooking is the true artform of tender bbq."   Could I be more bold than this review.  This place defines a hole in the wall restaurant and produces the best food and experience it can offer with out selling out.  From the employees that will try their best  to learn your name to the love in the food with the Texas feel.    I put my credibility on the line for this "hole in the wall joint" What an experience.  East of Broadway and 24th St. this building has proved to be a destination location for greatness.  One of the hardest things a business can  do is stand alone and not become successful because of traffic rates or marketing investments.   At anytime you can see that people drive and walk far to support the location.    Take my advice if you want the Best BBQ and respond with a review of your own.
4	p9XcPuwEqU4ielzSQsk3Q	I really love playing pool here.  Some of the other reviewers seem to think it's in a bad neighborhood or something,  but I have never seen anything really sketchy happen there. Just seems like your run of the mill strip mall to me.  There is kind of a rowdy parking lot crowd on the weekends since Graham Central Station is in the parking lot , but nothing too crazy.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful and always check on you to make sure you are doing a okay.  They have a very large number of pool tables to play on hourly and per game.  Are they shiny and new? No not at all, but I like the "Color of Money" neighborhood pool hall feel.  The few times I have encountered a loose pocket or something off with a table it's been fixed the next time I go in.  The hourly pool rates and food prices are very reasonable and the service is great.  Try the Onion Rings and the Sundae :) you won't regret it.  The other bar food they have is nothing new or different, but very good by bar standards.    I would have given this place 5 stars, but they have 3 nights a week they do pool leagues so you can't play during those times.  Which is cool I should probably join a pool league anyway.  If you play pool you should go in and have some fun.
2	DEYt5opQuoFcJDc6QLtsw	Wifey and I dined here in Nov., 2008, and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average. The place was dead on a weeknight, a bad sign. The room looked like it could hold 300 people, and there were only about 7 of us total. Service was good, but chips and salsa was mediocre, food (nachos and enchiladas) was average, even below average. We found it to be more expensive than other, similar Mexican restaurants in the area. I would not go here again.
2	B0i1Q7j3bMA6kOamLtnA	I really have never been a fan of Chinese fast food, but I wanted to give it a second chance.  This restaurant smelt scrumptious from the outside, plus I skipped breakfast that Saturday and I was starving, I needed something fast!  They had egg-foo-yung on the menu, which is always tempting, but a hit or miss nonetheless.    I am spoiled by the egg-foo-yung in China town, New York and nothing else stands the test.  So, I went with a staple dish, Vegetable Lo Mein.    The woman I ordered from smiled from ear to ear and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying her day.  The food was served up with the quickness without a doubt, but the veggies tasted like they had been frozen for a while (the broccoli was kind of brown).  I have to say it wasn't bad for fast Chinese, but I am still not a fan.
2	7HP81MRtxA2JZwC8Tbq7g	I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why?  Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh.   Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, "Excuse me," three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order.  First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout.   That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet.   This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for.   All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck.
4	Gqzjp99WHeYt2SB5cPpLdg	I love Wong's!  I think it's the best orange chicken in the valley. They use only white meat chicken. I hear their egg rolls and fried rice are the best, too!  Wong's is a hole in the wall. There's no getting around it. It's not the prettiest, and if you've ever had to use their restroom you know that they could seriously do some remodeling, but it's clean (just old, and falling apart). The atmosphere is the only thing keeping it from being a 5-star place. The food is top notch!
4	VKgWE12edsZvOor0ZgW8hg	My family loves going here.  Kids get 2 sides for free and then we usually split a kids meal between them. My husband and I love when they have the pot roast over egg noodles special! They have lots of other great plates, too. The servers are always friendly and the place is always clean. Very family friendly if you're looking for a simple home cooked experience.
4	mBOcnSxzwXCJ1vIeHaevA	First time I have ever been here.  This is a dive bar.  And let me tell you, I sure love dive bars.  Their wings are delicious.  Some of the best wings I have ever had in Arizona.    We went on a Sunday on a Groupon deal so we splurged for wings and 2 burgers plus beer.  The pints were well priced but they didn't have a large selection though.  The burgers we had were delicious.  I had the "Hot Burger."  It was the special for the day and was only $7 and change for a huge burger and a large helping of steak fries.  The wings we had were the sweet chili.  Yum.  The service was real good.  They were very attentive and speedy.  The atmosphere was nice and I was more than comfortable at the bar for my first time there.  TVs everywhere and what was cool was that there were TVs in each booth!  Pretty sweet.  Would definitely return to bar for some good bar food and some brewskis.
4	NOZq1kPGeU4DPu2CAe7kA	I've been coming here since the place opened, having been acquainted to Red Devil's McDowell location in the early 80's.  Usually don't eat inside too often, but have never had a bad experience.  The pizzas are top notch as well as the toppings (not a Pizza Hut), the wings are from full size chickens as opposed to Long Wongs and bar wings.  The prices are more than reasonable.  Usually get a takeout pizza, however one time they incredibly gave my pizza away to someone else (how you do that I don't know) so had to wait while they made a new one that they gave me FREE of charge.  The parking here is much more accommodating than that circus of a mess that they have in Phoenix.
2	u2w4KbjtxYLNdQ7AKi8w	Ok, so I know it is Vegas, but $14...$14 foot long! My friends and I sung that song all weekend...$14 dollar, $14 foot long. The pricing is NOT the same as in other cities so beware... The cheapest sandwich starts at $8.   It was a Good Phillie cheese steak sandwich, but not worth $14. Subway, you better get your act together or else...
4	6Xve8dBp1Zqs762EEVYgSA	This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out!
4	RXLnm1niKMtV4T8rx5kPPQ	My husband and I live within walking distance to this restaurant.  It opens at 6:30a and they make a good breakfast.  We get creative and they're good with substitutions (try an Omelette with Goat Cheese, Mushrooms and Bacon).  They do have a new chef, and unfortunately, he decided to replace the bacon. They used to serve this AMAZING bacon (worth
2	hishRZIQXCWocmodYW4Eg	Sapporo is mediocre. The food isn't very good. The last time I went there I got my appetizer before I got my drink. The service was terrible. They do have a really cheap happy hour. I would rather go to Blue Wasabi for sushi and drinks any day.
2	pMdVxwGsh7D0peMeDWUApg	Went here cause i wanted japanese style sushi.   This place converted a patio into a Arizona/sun room and then A/C'd it. Doesn't really match the whole "japanese"/sushi feel they had going on inside. Anyways enough about the decor.  I read some reviews, people said it was japanese style sushi. Well it was, but it was knock down great. I love to gauge sushi bars off of their Sashimi. Um... thats where they dropped on their face pretty hard.   I mean this is the livelihood of your restaurant, I was expecting some pretty good sashimi since the price was up on that end. The salmon had that old fish taste and smell, something that didn't really leave you saying i want more. The Tuna, BLECH! it didn't even taste anything recognizable.    We had two rolls, those were alright, but have gotten equally "alright" tasting rolls for half the price.  Wont be back. :( sad day
2	MUu7VxfT6WnMCZthpFsc5g	Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic, but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too "tacky nautical".  Prices are pretty average, but too high for the quality and service levels.
2	Af7NdvId9AYFNt1eHYLWA	So I have been at both the DT and the North Las Vegas local.   There are a couple of things that are really good---the chips are awesome, the shrimp wrapped in bacon (leave the sauce off) and the  coffee are fabulous!   The rest is the same as throwing a Patio dinner in the microwave. Tamales...I hear they are good but I was not taking any chances. The service is also hit or miss.   If this is the only option...stay home
2	tbsc0hJ854AJC5lvMJA0jA	Usually sushi restaurants, that know they have bellow average nigiri, make up for it by having unique and tasty rolls. This place fails on both counts....  Nigiri: Fish was stale. Almost like it was frozen just a few minutes ago, so there was almost no taste. The rice was disgusting.  Rolls: We didn't finish most of the rolls. Not because there was too much food, but because it was hard keeping it down.  Why two stars? Well the service was great, as were their miso soup and green tea. So if you want some tasty miso with tea.... this is your place.  My friend from Arizona begged me not to give them a bad review, because he comes here a lot. This is the best I can do.... I was seriously going to write something a lot worse.
2	WUJWNg9C5HT0NCyTNqKGQ	Those with the review that said they liked this place...have you been to Soup Plantation? Souper Salad...not so good! Soup Plantation - we absolutely love it! I would not go back to Souper Salad, unless someone begged me too. The broccoli cheese soup tasted like nacho cheese - yuck! Honestly, everything was just awful. I wished I had paid more for a nice salad at a nice restaurant.
4	O8DYC5fTMgIb53dc0VZO9g	This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line, which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!
4	Eqtet4uDQ4c8tG04Vvs2Ww	I have been by this place many times and finally stopped one day. I had Breakfast on a Saturday morning. My server was Maxwell. He was adorable and very professional. I was happy I had gone in.Food is not the best but, it is very inexpensive, so no complaints here.  After such a great experience, I thought I would go back for lunch. Since this time it was a week day Maxwell was not working, so I was given another waiter. He tried, however yelling at me from across the room ,did I need anything else was not professional at all. I know he just did not know any better. Please do not discuss your personal lives at work where all the patrons can hear. It is bad Business. Perhaps Maxwell should be teaching the others how to behave when they are at work. I had gone in for a late lunch so there was only 3 other tables in here.  All the more reason not to put your business out on the street. I am sure I will be back. But, I am hoping to get Maxwell or someone similar next time. Bathroom is clean and lots of parking in the lot.
2	zbonJiNes9ojuX5aqX3J9A	What's really good about this place is that it's open late. The pizza slices are fairly large but they're meh. Essentially, the slices are pre-made and then warmed. Even though they put my pizza through their warmer, it was still cold.   The whole pizzas come in two sizes: medium (12") and large (16"). Medium pizzas cost anywhere from $10 to $11.75. Large pizzas cost anywhere from $14.25 to $17.50.
2	8PncOaBKocyNuCxsNztRw	Had an hour to kill before boarding, and this was the closest to our gate. Sat down for a drink and tried to order and appetizer (chips with queso) but they were out of it. So we settled for the chips with green salsa, yet it came out with two tiny plastic containers (like the kind you get from a taco shop you only go to after 2am) of salsa, one red and one green. Chips were cold and stale...and they cost $4.99. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant. Granted, it was 10pm, however, it was so packed we got the last table! She was definitely rushed but not her fault. We didn't try any other food, so not sure how it is! I would recommend trying another restaurant in the terminal!
2	3ojRhmSpGfOxdvCijQStrA	Oh my goodness!  Employees are so grumpy!  We tried to go through the drive through to get our free satisfries. We were told we could only get one order per car do we had to park and go inside.  Kind of ridiculous.   Satisfries = meh.
4	8ItTwinVfD62be3W27FsNg	The price is high for what you get, but I still enjoy a good meal at the Chart House.  I've had several steaks here and have been pleased with all of them. We've thoroughly enjoyed the Chocolate Lava cake as well.  I certainly recommend that.  As others have said, the lake view is a nice touch.  The wait staff could use a little lightening up, and it wouldn't hurt to turn the lights up just a bit.  Who know though, maybe they're trying to target the 'My date's ugly but I want good food' crowd.
4	cYq8Wn2bEplp3ShWwtv0jQ	Best chain style pizza in town. We alternate between here, Spinato's, and Streets, but Rosatis double thick is my fav. Be warned though, it's pretty expensive so it wouldn't be my choice when all the guys are over for football. But it's perfect for family pizza night.  This location is delivery and take out only.
2	c0nuNlfrGdMUuqbWTA1XQ	All the great reviews made me wanna try this one, since I love Asian food. Free parking right next to the restaurant was nice. Interior was dated and didnt look clean, including a layer of dust on the wall next to our table.  Food was - unfortunately - really not very good. I wanted to like this place, but I couldnt. I ordered sweet n sour shrimp. The shrimp looked huge when I got them, so I was excited. However, what I found out in the first bite was that the shrimp were actually tiny. And I mean tiny, like 1/2 inch size. They just had a layer of greasy dough around them that blew them up to well over 1 inch size. I ended up peeling the dough off and just had this huge plate full of dough - never mind the annoying/ messy work. My husband had a beef dish that he said wasn't very tasty, plus the ratio of lettuce-bed to beef made us think that they must have mistaken my husband for a bunny... Service was very disinterested, they were staring at a laptop while we were waiting for the check to come...  Sorry, but never again. And I am very surprised that other people had such a vastly different experience...
2	t67kTO0ToPTAvcL2j38xw	The Kalbi was very good, but nothing else really stood out for us. The place is small, and nothing very special on the inside.  I would prefer to head across the street to DJK, or down the street to Mother's or Sura myself.
4	jqgbnBuU2ZfAxwezv3TA	5 corn dogs for 5 bucks.......Tuesday special on Milkshakes for 1.29......Franks made with Chicken instead of Beef or Pork.....Priceless. This establishment is great place to stop after going to an NFL.....NHL...MLB....or Spring Training game because it is near all of those facilities if your head back to the East Side of the Valley. The restaurant is very clean....the staff is nice and the food is very good. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
4	DJOHZO4mtSho2GgXor7GPA	A cute setup for a pub... decorated in British/Irish fare... several tvs all over the bar, with 5 in the center airing 5 different sports events. Enough to keep me entertained even if all I'm doing is drinking by myself... but I'm blessed with good company. There are also strings of lights all over the eaves that makes me feel like it's Christmas. The music selection is a little odd with its random variety - or is that the jukebox's fault?  The food was pretty delish, with good prices for decent portions. I loved the BBQ Turkey and Bacon Sandwich and the Seafood Chowder. The bf also noted that although the Chicken Fettucine isn't on the regular menu, you can still order it. The service can be hit or miss as it does get pretty busy for one waitress in a full bar.  Now I just need to find somebody in Pittsburgh who can mix me a Black Opal.
4	KJWXatiSJhsn8mB1BonAA	Linda's won't win any awards for the decor, but the food is so very tasty. I visited a few Sundays ago for breakfast and had the best biscuits and gravy. My companions were happy with their breakfast choices as well.   This is an inexpensive, friendly little place. Everything is homemade, and worth a try.
2	M5Mc48MM8VdPAL2JJdrb2g	Usually love Kyoto bowl but the last 2 times we have ordered there we have been disappointed.  We ordered the hot & spicy chicken and the chicken was dry and there were absolutely no veggies and the dish was flavorless.  I understand one time that there could be a training issue but for this to happen twice alarms me.  I will give it one more try then it is off my list of quick weeknight dinners.
4	ZJdoVcUh2i68VicQVbmtTg	Dude! There is a Los Betos right across the street from the Whiskey! When you're done oogling the girls on Wednesday night, go there and pick up a burrito. They're under $4 and you're so effed up that you will be thinking it is the best damn unicorn burrito you have ever tasted!  But I actually recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese. They messed mine up last night and added chorizo and it was the BOMB! The horchata is also sweeeeeet!!!  P.S. - Don't expect fast service. Do expect a line.
2	d7c7oVyvhYXPM3K7FyHU8w	so hubby and i have never been so inspired to start up a yelp account until this very day, right after coming home from lunch at the common plea. oh and note that there is supposedly a "business casual" dress code.  we were very excited to try out common plea. we had a $30 gift certificate to spend there, and we figured lunch would be a good time to try out the food fare. and if it was any good, we might go back for dinner some time.   when we arrived at 12pm, it didn't look too busy, but it filled up more by the time we'd finished lunch. however, even though it wasn't terribly busy, we were led to the back of the restaurant to be seated on the back "wall" we shared with their kitchen staff. we didn't mind the noise until our fake wall started shaking from time to time.   they offer bread rolls and a flatbread cracker and seasoned olive oil dip while you wait for your food. the sweet wheat roll was soft and delicious, as was the large cracker. however the other two sourdough-looking rolls were hard as rocks, thus rendering them inedible. i don't know how they taste because the crust was simply too hard to bite through.    hubby ordered the espresso crusted salmon with honey basil yogurt and mushroom rice, while i had the piattini - a set of 3 appetizers, and i picked the prosciutto wrapped shrimp, short rib sliders, and crab boursin cornet (a cone-shaped pastry stuffed with crab mixed in with boursin cheese).   the espresso crusted salmon was pretty good and standard for salmon. however the espresso crust was very light. it was barely noticeable, unless you ate pieces of the salmon directly on top. it flaked well, but wasn't as tender or moist as salmon we've had elsewhere. or even the chimichurri salmon we get from trader joe's and bake at home. the rice lacked flavoring and was a bit hard when chewing through it. i expected more of a risotto-like consistency. at least it looked the part. they are quite good at plating their food.   in terms of my set of 3 appetizers, i definitely enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped shrimp. basically it's lean italian bacon wrapped around large prawns. i got 2 of them along with about 2 teaspoons of a mango/red bell pepper/red onion/cilantro salsa. the salsa was good, but as long as you use fresh ingredients, it's pretty hard to screw up.   my crab boursin cornet i was very excited about when i saw it on my plate. it was a little (2.5 in. long) pastry horn/cone stuffed with a ball of mixed crab with boursin cheese. the flavor was good, however i was disappointed when i discovered my pastry crust was soggy and cold. usually pastry crusts are supposed to be flaky, crispy, and hot in my experience. when i mentioned this to the waiter, and asked "is my pastry crust supposed to be soggy and cold?" he said "yes, that is how it's supposed to be". so sad. it could have been sooo much better. there was potential there. i'll give them that.   then my short rib slider. was small as expected. a toasted bun with carmelized onions, mushrooms, and "short ribs". i took one bite and had to put what was in my mouth back on the plate. it was incredibly chewy, in a bad way. upon opening up my slider and examining my "short ribs", i discovered i was chewing on a piece of fat. when i attempted to dissect apart the paltry bit of meat from the fat, that proved to be impossible with a fork and knife because the actual meat on that thing was too tough to either bite or cut through sadly. hubby's attempt at my slider wasn't any better. he said it was 90% fat. and he had to agree what miniscule pieces of meat in there were extremely tough to chew on and bland.   we thought about giving them one last chance with dessert. so we picked the creme brulee option. we've actually made our own creme brulee quite a bit... it's a real favorite treat for us! the crust seemed freshly torched, it was crisp and wasn't too burnt. however upon cracking the crust, hubby noticed lumps inside the creme brulee. and texture-wise, it tasted like really thick whipping cream with lumps of course, it's usually a bit more pudding-like and smoother.  it came with an almond-covered cookie thing. i was confused when i bit into it, because it tasted like a stale cookie. then hubby pointed out that it was a thin slice of white bread, with almonds and stuff baked on top. not too appetizing. it would have been so much better if they attempted almond tuilles.  sadly, our meal did not go as well as planned. the presentation of the food is pleasant and appealing to the eye.  taste was just alright for hubby and 1 out of 3 appetizers for me. oh and they don't refill water for you at all throughout the meal. and be prepared to wait at least half an hour for your food and the same time for your dessert to come out even if it doesn't look busy. not planning to come back to this one any time soon.  OH AND BTW... YELP LETS RESTAURANTS FILTER OUT NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND HIDES THEM. CLICK ON THE FILTERED REVIEWS LINK ON THE BOTTOM TO SEE THE REST!
2	6LfC9ZciJXIeZyufrXiN2A	My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed.   Once we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of.   Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience.
4	ZJMQjENvX78rq0WcbST2Q	Bob Evan's in Champaign IL is very good.  We had Pork roast with mashed potatoes and carrots.  Plus dessert. Oh so good. The help is very friendly and the place was clean so where the restrooms.  I know not every Bob Evan's is good I have tried others and I would never thought there is a Bob Evans that good. Give that one a try.
2	ZKR55vGRADsS79kpeZvzfA	Highly disappointed.  After seeing the establishment for years, I finally decided to try it after reading the reviews.  I ordered the orange chicken, the Flamingo special chicken, the BBQ pork fried rice, and the fried wontons.  The Flamingo special chicken was an over-fried slice and diced chicken breast, so dry that it was almost like a greasy beef jerky.  The onion and garlic sauce served on the side tasted like a burnt soy sauce.  I had to soak the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes to make it somewhat edible, but burnt beef jerky was not what I was hungry for.  The fried rice was ok, with nice pieces of traditional chinese BBQ pork.  The only problem was that it stuck together so much that the rice was more like a giant rice cake than fried rice.  I seems as thought the rice was pre-cooked way too long.  The fried wontons were your typical fried sheets of wonton wrapper with a sweet and sour sauce that tasted too much like ketchup.  The orange chicken was decent, with the sauce being very flavorful.  The chicken chunks were a good size, and of all the items, this was the most appetizing.  It was nice that the dishes came with white meat, and I was not charged additional for white meat like some other chinese restaurants in the area.
2	J2StVpIwMVriu121ciUKA	Can you Google the ingredients for Chop Suey? This is lame. All they use is celery, sprouts and onion! Where is the rest? Flavor bland! Service okay, price cheap, but I have eaten at better hole in the wall joints. I will not be back.
2	QyFJOspJqLP1KlUSLQvkg	It was just ok.....nothing special.  To start off....we ordered the 2 types of meat: BBQ pork and Roast pork and it was quite a small portion for the price ($13... not worth it).   Since it was so small, we decided to order half a BBQ duck afterwards.   Taste was ok...  All the other dishes were ordinary.  Prices seem high.  Service was lacking....we had someone who could not use a chopstick and she had to get up and get a fork herself.  Place is not that big yet we had trouble flagging a waiter down.  After the meal, we asked the waiter to call a taxi for us and he refused and just gave us the phone number instead.  Would I return?  Nope.
4	8IFbS4eGNNNmMkS7pY0TA	I like Mr Goodcents and have taken several friends there to introduce them to an alternative to Subway.  The subs are made fresh, the bread is soft and delicious and there is never a long wait.   You can get a pretty decent size meal for a great value, just as Kristin C. explained in her review.    I have not personally tried the pastas but friends have and they agree that they are pretty good for the price you are paying for them.
2	5DwFoUKdDlaWGQCMvnXB4w	Good food, been in point since it was little Chicago's. Deep dish pizza is awesome. Service was ok. But here's my gripe. Who wants to sit down to eat in an UN aircondioned restaurant, with 7 oz plastic cups, and plastic forks and knives. Who serves a 3 inch thick pizza un cut, and expects you to cut it with plastic ware. Just because you do a lot of late  night business with drunk people doesn't mean you should neglect the day time dining crowd. We do care about how we eat our food, not just shoving it down our throats to help get us a dui checkpoint.
4	wk0zg0kx9LoJUpGlkJTLA	I used to work in the area and some folks from work invited me along.  How sad is it that without that intervention I might have never known about the Chicago Hamburger Co?  So sad... So sad...  It's not a big place (ok, it's a dive, but a great dive) and their parking gets really full at lunch time.  Try to go during more "off" hours your first time.  Once you know how good it is, you'll be willing to park as far away as needed.  You walk up to the counter/window while perusing the menu on the walls.  I've never not had a super friendly person taking my order.  Sometimes it's even the owner.   They've got more of a food selection that you might think.  Hot dogs, burgers, sausages, turkey, chicken, roast beef, fish, veggie burgers, cheese steaks, wings, salads, fries, onion rings, shakes.  My friend knew he'd love the place as soon as he saw "Frito Pie" as an option.  You can check out their full menu at http://www.chicagohamburger.com. And yes, those are current prices. Less than $4 and you've got a nice meal.  For $5 a feast.  Amazing hot dogs.  Standard burgers can take a few minutes because they are being freshly made - but SO worth the wait.  I haven't seen anyone not love what they got.  I can not come here without getting sliders.  Won't happen.  Ever.  And why you may ask?  Because they are better than White Castle.  I know what you're thinking (Oh NO she Didn't!!!) but yes, yes it's true.  Their buns are amazing.  They manage to be light and fluffy, yet thick and dense.  I can't explain it - but I don't have to.  For less than a buck you can have your own w/ Cheese.  Good luck eating just one.  I'll get one - if I'm also getting a hot dog.  But most folks get at least 2 or 3.  I witnessed someone eat 6.  Well, 5 1/2 - but he did better than I had expected.  We normally get one fry and one onion ring because they are both SO yummy it's hard to pick.  Fries are cut thin and Rings are cut medium-thick.   Oh yea...  For anyone that has ever loved a shake - you must have one here.  I tried a friend's strawberry shake as we were headed out the door, and immediately turned around, got back in line and ordered my own.  Since then - we have come by to get sliders and shakes many times.  And we live 20 minutes away.  They are that good.  Oh yea - tons of Chicago stuff on the walls, tv always on showing "the game" and there is a pinball machine and a Ms. Packman.  Waca waca waca....
2	Vf2j0SPAGN67XMPmvQp3Vg	It's only 8:00pm and your out of empanadas for the night? So much for Open Late!  And what's with the folding chairs taking up space in the parking lot? I didn't know you had opened a used car lot too! Geeze - not the best service!!
2	4vEIGYiVKp44JvDua72Yw	Ordered delivery . Thought it was a bit weird that the chicken was dark meat . (cost extra for white ) I asked for the dish extra spicy and it actually was the perfect for me. It may have just been this dish specifically so I may give it another try, just order something different.
4	Grlrs77lPBaw9wqTOiCQ	After a disappointing visit to Murphy's on Wednesday evening for a burger, I decided to try Legend's on my way out of town late Thursday afternoon.  I was not disappointed.  It's a bar - bar food, beer, booths and stools.  The food is actually quite good.  This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and it will now be my 'go to' spot for a burger when I'm in Champaign.    Did I say that the girls here were much, much more attractive than over at Murphy's?
2	e7KDm5t49e6PYnLWbX3YvA	After a late flight in, my wife and I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before going home. We had 3 choices. Chili's was crowded, Applebee's was packed, so we went to Fridays that was not crowded at all. I now know why. Food took over 30 minutes, for 2 appetizers, TV's were playing the local news with no sound or CC (might as well had muted C-SPAN on), and all anyone working there wanted to do was closing clean up, even though they had 2 1/2 more hours to go till closing. Food was ok, service was sub-par. Needless to say we will not be going there again, unless there are no other options. Still would probably just go home hungry.
4	Tgzo3aczQu70r3Z3wC6UA	My first time ever eating Baja Fresh and it is the best!! OMG the chips and fresh and the guacamole is sooo good. I really enjoyed eating here. I orders the chicken fajitas with corn tortilla and the chicken was perfect for being fast food. Totally going here more often.   The reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is the wait time is a little longer than I would've expected.   Will return!
2	GWh72E8aNcfuMsns6PGewg	pros:  -large outside covered patio -fast service -large portions -clean bathrooms  cons:  - too salty, greasy, somewhat flavorless food - expensive (especially for lunch) - poorly set-up (confusing- do i get the take-out containers and the fortune cookies or am i supposed to ask the server?)
4	uOMQ1Pc9pVazz0nGtAWgw	Sonora is home to three of my biggest weaknesses: cream ales, Kobe burgers, and wings. In two of these three categories, they completely excelled. And in the third? Well, I'm really very picky about wings, so take that with a grain of salt.  The cream ale is delicious, and it goes very well with the kettle chips and the chipotle ketchup. Yeah. Chipotle ketchup. I've never even heard of that before, but it's pretty much my new favorite condiment.  The Kobe burger is niiiice. I got mine medium rare, but I almost wish I'd asked for it extra-rare. I'm weird about ordering my beef rare in places I've never been to, but they cooked my med-rare burger perfectly, so I'd trust them to do rare really well. Wait, not well. Rare. You know what I mean.  Like I said, I'm really picky about wings. I prefer mine to be drowning in sauce, so I was kind of sad to see that the wings at Sonora are pretty dry. They taste good, but they're just not as saucy as I'd like.  It's a cute place, and if I lived in Phoenix, I'd probably be a regular for beers and Kobe burgers.
2	ummEpnjqtjh3AVQpC8Y0UA	We came here once.  We waited longer than the quoted time.  They did bring out pizza to satisfy a little bit of our hunger.  When they do take you to your table, they take you through the kitchen so you can see what is going on.  They even have a table in there that you can request to eat at.  We were placed near the bar, and it was very loud.  There are also pictures all over the walls.  A majority of them are of nude women.  I don't know about you, but I am not bringing my children to a place where they have pictures of nude women on the walls.  The food was good.  It is served "family" style.  One dish will serve 2-3 people.  It is cooked with a lot of garlic though.  We went once and that was enough for us.
4	LqwHwOc4tn6c9tYpl3PXjA	So I wouldn't go there on a romantic date, but you will find me there for lunch a couple of times a month.   The chips and salsa are good, but what I really go there for is their Fry Bread.  I've eaten at the competition and it's good, but El Bravo does a fantastic job of satisfying my need for overindulgence.  I get the Navajo Taco, and there is enough meat, beans, cheese and veggies to make two meals.  You've gotta try it :) I've never had to wait for a table and the food always comes fast enough to make it back to the office before my lunch break is over.
2	uaKG4rSLg2uRo7gT7jGEQQ	Oh man, I can't really choose between Perkins and IHOP because they are both equally BAD. Perkins was dark and depressing and the food was extremely oily. Ask yourself: Do you want to start your day with breakfast (or lunch or dinner for that matter) at this place?
4	U3rwYhZCCE9oxB4E9SeNKA	I'm a fan of China Lite. It's take out focused (though has eat in option) and is healthy/semi-healthy Chinese fast food.  Our office is about 100 yards away so we go there often. Pretty much our quick & cheap go to lunch spot. Good food, reasonable, quick and they have a number of healthy options.  Feels at least partly authentic though they do also have several "American Chinese" selections (which I can also enjoy). I'm a big fan of the Szechuan green bean with chicken but sometimes need a good Sargent Chang's chicken or a honey crispy chicken.  My pops is from Canton, China so Chinese food is something we've grown up with. While it is take out/fast food focused, definitely a viable option.
4	hKRLtVyt1NnMp4Ot6T82xw	Being an avid carb lover, it's safe to say that if it has "bread" in the name, chances are I LOVE it!  Their tomato bread salad should win an award.  Granted, I had never heard of such a thing before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but damn!   It is AMAZING!
4	zcHHACxeHwNHzsc5LLLmEQ	First things first: I am not a morning person. And as such, frequenting breakfast restaurants aren't real high on my must-do list. At least at home I can eat my pancakes with my hair all nasty and one eye open.  But I was coaxed out of my hovel one morning and discovered the joys of The Good Egg. I never know there were SO MANY ways to cook eggs! And, judging by my dish and the tastes I stole off my companions', all of them at The Good Egg are very good. For those not too hot on eggs, they also serve bakery items, sandwiches and others.   One neat thing about The Good Egg is that when it gets crowded they serve coffee, water and mini-portions of their baked items in the waiting area.
4	ejrWJeL18fUw0XjmRlkBPA	I come here mostly for coffee on the way to work - consistent taste and I enjoy their iced mocha coffees- very sweet and strong!! inside seating is nice, but ive only done drive-thru- clean outside, reasonable customer service :)
4	5PkiD0YtP2WuMWvclovROg	All the previous reviews on here are for dining, what about the hotel? I stayed 2 nights, a Sunday and Monday. Nice hotel! It is a grand  old mansion built circa 1886 and designated an historic landmark. Definitely an old school hotel, there is internet and basic TV, rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless. The place  has a certain charm to it. If you like your hotel to be quiet, quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay. Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh. The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880's and makes for pleasant walking. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Would have been 5 stars if I had my own coffee maker in the room, but the staff is always ready to being you a carafe for no charge, I just prefer to wake up and not have to dress to go for my first coffee....
2	d1CvzllHCEC0GoZohwgD3w	I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay. The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.   It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations.
2	21gXoNeW7wwSHQKxEoTOiA	The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.  My wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.  I was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.  While we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.  My cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.  The saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.  Their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?  Sorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.
4	ZCLTEiNS3KbvElS1oOzfGg	Okay, THIS place is the bomb-diggity!!! They are pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you and oh... the food! Super delicious!! I've had a few different things there now and I'm NEVER let down!! Their French Onion soup is delicious and the cobb salad was outstanding! My ex always get their 4 cheese macaroni and LOVES it!!! You can NEVER go wrong with Wally's!!!!! :-)
2	K5NETaHDCWVw3corw6pUqA	Ordered delivery- the staff was friendly and our order arrived quickly. However, our pizza seemed like it was pre-cooked and had been sitting under a warmer forever. Also ordered the chicken poppers- they too seemed like they had been sitting out awhile and did not come with the sauce we ordered.
2	PBJQrympQCJpOHfgC4pEcg	My idea of going out for dinner does not involve fluorescent lights, kids running around, and using tongs that are sitting IN the food.  But once in a while I break my own rules.  I had some errands to run, late as usual, and was in the shopping center anyway, so I called my husband and suggested he meet me there.  We've been here many times before.  He got a BOGO coupon online and drove over. Sweet Tomatoes is usually okay, and tonight it was less okay.    I was surprised to see that the prices are now up to $10.50 pp.  Okay, but we had a BOGO.  But wait...in order to use it, you have to buy two drinks.  We don't usually buy drinks unless they're alcoholic, and I know from past experience that Sweet Tomatoes' coffee is the worst swill in the world.  They charge 2.39 for any drink, which puts their coffee at a price even higher than Starbucks, and it's undrinkable. I don't do soda or iced tea.  I usually like their salads, but tonight was an exception.  One, a spinach with turkey, apples, and almonds, tasted really peculiar.    Every month the theme changes except, apparently, December.  All the inspiration went out with Thanksgiving.  There was stuffing to put into a cream of turkey soup.  Many of the salads had turkey as an addition.  The soups were uninviting, too, unless you like cream soups:  there were two to choose from.  They had an Asian Ginger broth whose sign said to add spinach, mushrooms, scallions, and a host of other ingredients, but all of those were way on the other side, requiring a walk to the back of the restaurant to get around back to the front, where the salad item are.  And the one chili seemed like a soup with meatballs, thin and watery, and not very spicy.  I've never tried any of the hot pasta dishes until tonight, but the penne in a peppery sauce with Italian sausage sounded good, so I took a tablespoonful.  It was dreadful - lukewarm, with gummy pasta and just one speck of sausage left in the entire wok receptacle.    One big reason I don't like coming here is the ambient temperature.  In the summer, it's freezing, because the air conditioning is blasting and the ceiling fans are spinning.  In the winter, it's...freezing!  I had on a sweatshirt and a fleece jacket, and couldn't take the jacket off.  It started to warm up a little, and then got so cold my nose was running.  I asked the manager if it was corporate policy to keep the place so cold that people eat fast, eat less, and leave!  He said the AC wasn't even on.  I hope this review will help turn on the heat, literally and figuratively.

Some of their hot sandwiches are very craveable (the roast beef au jus one, and anything with barbeque sauce always appeals to me), and it's a nice change of pace from Subway, and sooo much better than Jimmy John's.
4	QQXV4OePwMdPVHzviuSkfg	Dipped in here with large group of baseball players after their tournament for some drinks, food and cool air. After spending about 8 hours on the padres fields there in Peoria it was time for some cold drinks in an air conditioned building.   We were appropriately seated in the area with lots of booths, long tables perfect for large groups, and all the TVs we could possibly want (and empty). We had great servers who got everything right!!! There were tons of beers and non-alcoholic drinks all around and it was happy hour, so tons of low cost appetizers. The food was typical bar food (for appetizers). There were lots of choices and lots of southwestern/mexican choices on the menu.   The setup of the place is great. It is about two stories with open ceiling. It makes the place feel very large. The TVs are huge and different sports on each tv. The place is very clean and the staff is very nice. I would recommend going here if you are in the area, want some cheap happy hour food, and just want to watch some sports. It also seems like there are tons of special events at this place. There is a calendar that seems never ending.
4	gLKPncPk0LNWVONdaBJ6g	I had the pho and my friend had the vermicelli with grilled meat and egg rolls.  Both dishes were tasty.  The decor was cute but very dark for dinner.  The owner is very flamboyant.  One coworker loves this place.  He also says he was kicked in the head by the owner with her 5 inch heels and she threw trash at him.  Another coworker believes she is so rude that he will never go back.  I think the consensus between most of them is that the food is good and the owner gives a good performance. My friend and I did not receive a special performance but she does dress to impress in small tropical outfits.
4	FhiglS8kBEqVf1K2FenjNA	This place put on a presidential candidates forum for me! I had to write a review for them just for being awesome and willing to put politics up on their big screens early (5 -6:30pm) on a Saturday night. I long for a political bar in Phoenix (suggestions welcome) and so I was super thrilled when I called and they said it would be no problem to play the forum for just 4 or 5 of us.   Also, I had their hef on tap, fairly good. And a couple nibbles of my friend's cheese fries -- if grease equals goodness...those fries were damn near perfect.   Seemed to have a pretty laid back atmosphere. I bet it's nuts around game time, but a really relaxed place to grab a drink from what I could tell. Either way, 12 props for serving as a (objective of course) political venue when requested!!
2	zZ5gOnmjljRT3fyfd0yQ5Q	Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here.
4	spzB3RLDOJMtQalQ1c4hA	Drove right past the parking entrance my first time past. Actually, many firsts tied to this visit to Guanaquito; first mid-week lunch date, first time having Salvadorian food, first ensalda and my first pupusa. Our drink order was taken and I tried the ensalada this was a sweet and refreshing citrus drink with small pieces of pineapple and papaya this was a perfect drink on a hot day. For an appetizer we tried the pupusa which are fabulous handmade tortillas that are stuffed with a variety of fillings, sampled the pork, cheese and bean - outstanding. For my entr\u00e9e I had the Chile relleno. Hands down the best relleno I have ever tried. This version was stuffed with carrots, potato, pork and cheese simply scrumptious.   Over-ordered for lunch and I'm enjoying the leftovers as I type this review - just as good reheated.
2	CR7NcJgvRdmJvcji0Tnozg	I wanted to like Marie Callender's. The problem is it seems that since I last came here years ago the portions have gotten smaller,  the pot pies have shrunk, and the prices have gone up. The service tonight was not very good -the waiter pretty much ignored us. We were never asked if we wanted more water or anything else to drink -coffee? Dessert? The busboy was a lot more attentive than our waiter was, but of course he was busy clearing tables.   I love pot pies.  I really thought Marie Callender's would be good, but the chicken tasted fake -like they came from a can. The vegetables taste like they started out frozen. For over $12 The pot pie is definitely not worth the price.
2	KmGSFX5PuHbxpw8qZIUQZw	Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food.   The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them.   So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets.   It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had.   Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch.
4	XET194v0S5byqZlnrZY8WA	My wife is a die hard but that's because she grew up eating here. I can say this is not a bad place for food. They make a good everything.   We had  2x 3 way burrito green chili, red chili and bean with green sauce on top.  1x Pollo fundito with rice (excellent) A ton of chips and salsa  The bill was slightly over $20...lol freaking MCD'S is more.
4	d54yf2SirdksZ7qJpHG3w	I think triangle hoagies are great for parties and tailgates.  I normally order one or two battleships and all the fixings.  They are huge, they are reasonably prices, they are prepared quickly, and they are delicious!  I definitely will be back for more soon!
4	ecu3vpExOf9PKxOD4H0gfg	This was the first time I had Taco Bell in MONTHS!  You can imagine my excitement to try the XXL Chalupa for the first time... just went through the drive trough, but it was heaven.... now it will be another 6 months or so before I go back= just been on this "watching what I eat" kick lately so this was my weekend splurge for the month.  I told myself if I beat my deadline at work (which I did at 6pm on Friday evening)... I would treat myself.  When I used to go here often... the service is pretty quick.  Though one time they ran out of soft taco shells... so half the menu was not availabe... not cool.  I'd imagine a lot of people come through there... but oh well.
4	X2RwJEGzwRwlPXjq95U7Kg	I gave four stars because the place was clean, food was good, and service was fast. The guy that took my order wasn't overly friendly, but he wasn't rude either. As for the food I judge a sandwich for the bread as much as anything, and the bread here is great - I got wheat. My sandwich was overstuffed, making it very hard to eat. The fries are crinkle cut and we're fantastic. I ate in, which afforded me unlimited self service refills. There is no table service here. Parking was easy and plentiful, just approach from the east ( coming from Charlotte ) because there is no access from the other way - you'll have to do a U-turn.
4	EtWubPFImpABNkb77ZDY5A	Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great.  Food was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux.  The location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward.
2	MGAydTDTXdJC9cVDflilQ	Depending on the time and day it's a little iffy whether you will get good service. The management really does need to get the meth head servers out of there, as they give the place a bad image.  For an inexpensive breakfast it's pretty good - but I have been there some mornings and the food isn't as good.  We went on a Friday morning and there were a handful of customers and the server couldn't get herself moving fast enough to keep up with filling coffee cups. It wasn't even that busy.   Probably won't go back for awhile due to the poor service this last time.
4	ZQcKTTSzjuRNpu0trTWZOw	I dig Hunan Express, I order from here all of the time. A lot of the other Chinese delivery in the area is nigh inedible, and Hunan Express has good and plentiful food for cheap. The items are hit or miss but some are really good--I particularly love the hot and sour soup. On occasion they use a new recipe or something and I dislike it, but most of the time it's really excellent--full of tofu and fungus, as it should be.  Things I've tried and enjoyed aside from the hot and sour soup are the hunan beef, the chicken corn soup, the bok choy, the chow fun, and the potstickers. The egg rolls are decent, just a little greasier than I like. The fortune cookies sometimes seem more like advice cookies, but that's true of all of 'em anymore.  I wish I could put three and a half stars, but I'll put a four for having my favorite hot and sour soup. I recommend ordering here if you have a hankering for a bucket-load of reasonably priced Chinese food and don't feel like changing out of your pajamas.
4	mFvxMXAIARtDSG5TAj5kMw	Well, what can I say, I have been eating at Barros for a long time now and this location is probably my favorite. It became a weekly Thursday tradition for my family to come here - they could take my order before I even spoke it.  The pizza is very good. Honestly, there is not anything that overwhelmingly special about it. It's just a great tasting and simple pie. And the consistency is exactly the same each visit.  Unfortunately, it's been a little while since my last visit, but the service was absolutely top-notch considering it's a pizza joint and they simply bring your order to your table when ready. And considering the staff was very young overall, they still managed to come around and ask us how the food was and how we were doing, but it wasn't forced, it seemed very genuine.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back... tomorrow methinks!
2	0eK4BEHUaLUp4D5ZRaQeGg	I've always enjoyed Domino's Pizza.  Yummy crust, nice and greasy; perfect late-night go-to.  But tonight's delivery literally made me lose my appetite.  We ordered two pepperoni and black olive pizzas; one with hot sauce and one without.  Both arrived so undercooked you could see the cheese hadn't even melted!  I mean, thanks for being prompt, but would you put my pizzas in the oven before sending them over next time?
2	64cwbDNg3vKxwZZ16MpQg	I have been in Vegas for about 4 months and have been in search of a local restaurant like what in California. This place is near my home and I had read some good reviews but, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.  I had the open-faced turkey and mashed potatoes. The turkey was mostly dark meat - which I do not like - and it was dry. The mashed potatoes had hardened a bit, like they were left under a warming lamp. The vegetables were dry and tasteless. I ended up leaving most of the meal uneaten. It was a shame because I so love turkey and mashed potatoes.  My husband had some kind of scramble - eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc. He said it was not very good and he also left most of it uneaten.  Overall, it was just a bad experience and one I will not be repeating.
4	wL7snxAc38xozuaKen6w	Was very happy with our visit to this restaurant. View was nice, service was perfect, and the meal was divine. I have a gluten allergy and they could not have been more helpful, in fact most of the dishes are gluten free. It was worth every penney.
4	UtxigV1uG2AZeBEHI2OtiQ	I went there after an interview with Highmark. I was satisfied. Nice atmosphere, may be a little pricey for a day to day lunch, but would be a nice treat to yourself every once and a while, My salad was what I expected, Fresh leafy greens and very good house dressing. My meal was enjoyable I got spicy beef dish and it came with potatoes. Dessert was very good. Overall, not a bad place, I would go back.
2	ZZlny2G0LU9JtkxvGgYw	I stopped on the way home tonight. It was dinner hour and pretty empty in the dining room. I think there were three customers in the dining area. There wasn't a line, but customers had to wait because the staff was more concerned about the schedule than the few customers that were waiting. We weren't even recognized as we stood waiting for service. Staff is loud, ever see "king burger" video? I think bon qui qui might work here. Inside is nicely decorated, but few totally sterile. You could probably just bring a hose in to clean it since there are few padded seats. I will choose a different one next time. McDonald's has changed so much over the years it's hard to recognized.
4	0sWNWL4XhBYxdzoC7hBMA	I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!
2	4naUrdaZpeKSCYsw9xXytw	The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland.
4	RgRQ2a2TqCTxGomCuxig	Both the regular restaurant and the sushi bar are above average.  Casual atmosphere, central location make this a great place for dinner before going out later in the evening.  Have enjoyed the crab, lobster, steamers, mahi mahi and sushi there.
2	Y73zRzoCPzG7aBrtVXJZQ	Not great.  Our food took forever and the service was less than stellar, for the price.  This place is way too expensive.  I would much rather drop my money at Wigwam or some other upscale place and be able to enjoy a more romantic ambiance.
4	NxpJwnl33NS43wRZLAg8Zg	There's nothing I like more than a well marbled NY strip. OK - maybe a tender free range chicken. Any piece of meat I have purchased from Old Time has not let me down. Well, the Dietz & Watson deli meats are wonderful but still pale in comparison to Boar's Head (available at the IGA over on Mattis). It's all fresh, favorful and kosher! If your deep freezer is empty - you can save a ton when you buy in bulk.  It's the local butcher shop me and my fiancee had been waiting for. And after three years of being open for business, Old Time Meat & Deli is rarely crowded and I can never figure out why. It's a good thing for customers in the know...
2	AIWavn7ip9YWZA9WoHT2GA	I'm from Southern California, so I have had plenty of experience eating at taco/burrito shops.  I demand not only good quality, but good value.  I placed an order for a carnitas burrito with rice added (for $1 extra).  I wanted it like they do in SoCal -- rice, meat and beans.  I also ordered a tamale, which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality.  If they make excellent tamales, that's a sign that they care about quality.  Well, the good news is that the tamale tasted great -- very authentic, the bad news is that it was tiny... maybe 4 oz. at best?  They give you this huge takeout box, which lends to the disappointment when you open it to discover a half-anemic tamale.  The carnitas burrito with rice?  What rice?  In fact, I want to know what happened to the burrito -- it was the size of something I would find at Taco Bell.  Mind you, this was a $5.50 burrito, and for that much I wanted more than a small Taco-Bell-style burrito (that I can get for $2.00).  So no only was the burrito tiny, but it was missing the extra rice.  Overall, for the $7.50 I paid I was very disappointed.  Not worth the money.  I sensed  an order error might happen when I heard the cashier call-out the order to the cook.  When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen, there is a huge possibility for error (as happened in my case).  This is unacceptable and their order system should be changed to a computerized system.  Pros:  authentic taste, fast friendly service, fresh home-made tamales  Cons:  Small, anemic servings, poor order taking, slow cleaning of tables
2	OgxHFiKBhcHfVlzyoLvA	Whatever happened to this place?  Seriously.  I remember when you couldn't even get in the door.  Now I walk in and feel like walking right back out.  Overall, I've got no complaints about the food.  I think it's average and priced well.  The lasagna is top notch.  And having a private lot in the Strip District is nice.  I usually dine in but on my last two trips I was placing an order to go.  After the first time I should have learned my lesson and called ahead.  Never again.  The first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order.  But there was no one there.  It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.    Skip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.  I guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.  The service here is hit or miss on a daily basis, but definitely beyond a miss when trying to get food to go.
2	lZEDZ4ihK0igeyNmp7avaA	I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back.
2	6G5BpfrYFDS2u7dCIqRjmQ	Great Hookah but I really think they need to clean the place. I have been there 3 or 4 times and everytime I have been the tables are always filthy the hookahs that are displayed are gross. ONLY enter the restrooms at your own risk because something in the toilet might come out and open the door for you. It's gross I don't care how good their hookah is they take no pride in their cafe and in keeping it clean for customers. Too many other clean Hookah joints in town I will not be going back!
2	v1gbfXFP8IsVoFoIyTShw	Just an update to my earlier review ... had dinner at Arriba's on Christmas Day (one of the few places that was open!) ... it was crowded and busy ... not too long of a wait for a table ... the food was very decent, very spicy, no complaints at all about the food ... and the service was better than I've experienced there before (I think it was due to table location), but still have issue with ambiance, and lack of upbeat attitude amongst the employees (although my server was just fine - the hostess staff was working with a chip on their shoulders!).
2	eJ6BmbPhU0y9wdtnAnmEg	My niece got the chicken nachos, which I watched them make:  chips, chicken, beans & chez was placed on a styrofoam plate and then microwaved.  The outcome is a soggy, chewy, mildly flavored slop.  My nephew got 2 beef enchiladas, which were actually ok. Their red sauce was good.  I got the Pepe sampler, which was pretty dull.  The beef and chicken just didn't have a good flavor, although their guac was pretty good.  total with 2 soft drinks and a beer was $32, so not *that* cheap.  I would rather go somewhere that uses real plates and metal silverware and pay an extra $10.
4	TKIM8Dr9NHIKUXFDc4KyHA	I met a friend from high school here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast. The place was busy, but despite that we still had pretty great service.  The french toast was yummy and what you'd expect from a chain. The food came out quick. Since it was reunion of sorts, I was happy they didn't seem to mind us sitting for about an hour and a half while catching up.  Definitely would come back.
4	zZ4m4bsFKYTwr0XM7sVoug	I don't normally try new restaurants without a referral - just hate to spend the money and then be disappointed if I didn't like the food.  I had a coupon so I decided to try Fiorella's.  When we walked in to for a late lunch at 1:30 PM there was no one there, which was a big surprise.   When I inquired about the "Lunch Special" which was not listed on the menu I discovered there was only one choice for the advertised special of $4.99 (spaghetti with maranara sauce).  However, since I had a a coupon for a buy one get one free it didn't really matter. The food was delicious!   We had bruchesetta for an appetiter, a chicken sandwich with tomatoes & pesto sauce and a crepe with veal, cheese & something else that was out of this world delicious.  The hot bread was divine! I ordered ice tea which tasted like instant tea - would not recommend.  Was surprised that it was still on my bill since I had asked them to get me water instead of the tea since it didn't taste very good. Desert was a warm brownie with ice-cream and chocolate syrup that was a special left over from their Valentine's Day menu.  It was still really  good. Beaufifully decorated.  I would definitely try this place again.
4	88YBQqhs4LljTxpzrfpwKw	There's two saloons in the South Hills. I was confused between Cain's and The Saloon of Mt. Lebo because they're both the "Saloon." Maybe it's like the Wild Wild West and they're feuding. In any case...  If it were to that angle, I'd be hard pressed to say which one would win the shoot out. I liked Cain's because it was clean, tons of beer choices and good bar food. BUT, even though this place is a little darker, a little more "aged" as I'll lovingly put it... they had some darn good wings. And beer selection. But those wings. They were crispy, the sauce was tangy and plentiful, plus it was just plain hot wings and they were delicious!  So the joint looks like it may have seen some better days... if you serve me some bangin' hot wings that are making me dream about them later and a row of around 30+ beers on tap, I'm in! I'll be back to demolish some wings...
2	kQEbyOpx1op4gSeBwPeCA	It was LOUD.  Loud is a deal-breaker for me.  This is my 5th time at Steiners but the first time I've been so totally turned off!  Last night was blasting-headache-inducing noise with the music cranked way up.  The service was casual to an extreme, the tables had not been cleaned and I was disappointed in the food.  We both had the angel hair pasta (tasty) with shrimp (bland).  Probably if you want to watch the game and are into the "Cheers" atmosphere mentioned earlier, with a burger and beer, this will work.  But for an evening when you can sit and yak, kick back and catch up with friends, not so much.
2	zOOW5OUY9bUe520Lxfw3KQ	Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.
4	6CB1nFOD7nAGoSbtyXAg	R.I.P. Shangri La? It became tradition to go here once a week with my family. The ambiance was dark, live piano player in the evenings, and a stream of koi under your feet. Even after moving much farther away from Shangri La we would even travel the distance for a large hot and sour soup when someone in the family was sick. I purchased a certificate for my sister recently as she is now living in Chandler again only to find out that they have shut their doors. Not sure if they will be back, but if not I just wanted to write this piece to express my desire for them to come back.
4	Jvf2LtWICEaGfpy57jb2PQ	One Liner: Delicious food after getting a tat  Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.2 Apparently Phoenix isn't just about Mexican food. This thai place offers quite a few delicious soups and noodles. Even the fried rice was good. The restaurant is sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a biker's bar. It may not be the most desirable area to be in, but the food is definitely rewarding. Be careful on the spicy or hotness scale. It can get pretty spicy.  Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.5  Service 0.1:   Decor 0.1:   Speed 0: Incredibly slow.....so think twice before doing lunch here if you have limited time   Dessert 0.1:   Prices 0.2:    My score for this experience is 3.7 stars.
4	5afo3hWMIUpWCXCzZ3WqQQ	My partner was able to score Valentine's Day dinner reservations on the patio which had me pretty excited to be checking out one of the more exclusive valley restaurants. There was a fixed prix fixe menu offered that evening featuring 4 courses plus 2 chefs tastings, not all of which rendered such a renowned valley establishment with a 5 star reputation worthy of such accolades. But that being said the grounds are quite beautiful - romantic, quaint, offers seating not clustered, and impeccably maintained all while taking in frank loyd wright's protege's keen eye for architectural design.   But back to the food.  1st chef tasting - pacific oysters garnished with a creme fresche, diced greens and tomato. The combination yielded a nice light crisp finish, garnishing a no brainier as the oyster varietal naturally has cucumber overtones. 1st course - lobster bisque - It's some of the best lobster bisque I've had on the west coast. Creamy decadent full of that lobster flavor extracted to the broth augmented by a good amount actual lobster meat from the body.  2nd course - foie tourchon - think foie gras laid on a bed of fig macadamia pomegranate seeds with a touch of balsamic. The liver content of foie gras seemed watered down. Maybe dumbed down a little for the prix fixe menu. That being said the quality of the ingredients completed each other quite well in this dish.  3rd course - filet with crab - It was served to the table luke warm. It was cooler than buffet food sitting for hours waiting for someone to consume it. Seemed like a nice char on the outside cooked to order in the center. Asparagus was tasty as were mashed potatoes. Bernaise was unexceptional.  2nd chef tasting - apple cotton candy. Haven't had cotton candy in years! It was light sweet hint of apple and cleared the palate nicely.  4th course - chocolate souffl\u00e9 - Wrights makes some of the best souffl\u00e9s in town. It was right on! A review based solely on the entree probably deserves 2.5 stars likely due to lapse in service but overall given price considerations and expectations for a restaurant of this caliber 3.99 stars.

Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk (chicken kebab) or Breaded Tilapia (one of their specials).   The woman who started the menu recently emigrated to the US after the tragedy in Lebanon. Go support local business!
2	PkNCiLOOyeJlDhvYeCAw	There's always a lowered level of expectation when dining at a chain restaurant. TGI Fridays can usually be counted on to deliver a tasty, reasonably priced meal. This location fails at that.   Whereas the menu offerings here promise flavor in the description, the food itself is really quite bland. There is a serious dip in quality from where this chain was just a few years ago. Cheaper ingredients are apparent and even the famed Jack Daniels barbecue sauce has lost it's zip.  Add to the fact that the food was disappointing, the drinks are watered down. I know times are tough and changes are part of the climate, but the prices which once seemed reasonable, now seem too high for the mediocre food.  I would suggest that it's not only the failing economy that is contributing to a nearly empty restaurant at 5:30 on a Saturday evening. There are other chains delivering better food at the same price. Hopefully Fridays gets back on track.
4	Z9PwlrlxbF2kjhBuRV9oA	I was always skeptical of this place, but was pleasantly surprised today.  We checked it out for lunch and ate at the bar, so we could watch college football.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the service and food were great!  Our server was very friendly and extremely efficient.  The food was actually very good.  I enjoyed enchiladas with beans and rice and was very pleased with my choice.
2	tsilycblIeaEVO3MA7wpg	In general our family really likes Rubios.  This location does not seem to have the same quality or consistency as the one we go to in Surprise.  The few times we have stopped in, it has been somewhat disappointing.  That said, we would still go back only because we really like the menu, and they have truly healthy options with some menu items.  Just wish the food looked as good when it comes out of the kitchen as it does in Surprise.
4	aHVnPNwfg3jI4vl34etBw	I ordered the flounder dinner. Generous portions.My meal was delicious. It came with the fish, cole slaw, french fries, and hush puppies. The only thing working against them is the appearance of the establishment, it looks a bit tattered but the food makes up for it. Also this is not a sit down establishment like the one in SW Charlotte. Business is family run.
4	WYTzoEOapOW3BgkssBcsQ	Jasons Deli for a meal? Don't order anything with tomato in it. Yes now I remember about the tomato salmonella; but they will let you order anything and not remind you they're no tomatoes. How about a BLT with no tomato? That's one dry sandwich! They made it right but not until I had to complain.
2	dOJaeX2WgQs0RtutfIMlg	I stopped in here this week, for the first time in years to catch the Wofford vs. Wisconsin basketball game.  It was about 3:00pm, and only the bar side of the building was being seated. Can I say it was an utterly chitty experience, and leave it at that?
4	yjC5d5u8hYumEBRwCWnnQ	As a Mexican food snob, it pains me to say this. It pains me to say that I love a corporate franchise that is owned by McDonald's, but I do, so there, and it's Chipotle.  Something about the brick of a burrito that I always get there is calming and makes significant steps towards soothing a weekend hangover. It isn't greasy at all and afterwards you don't walk away with the "I just ate too much Mexican food" stomach. They prep everything in house and the freshness comes out in everything I've ever ordered, all the way down the line to the chips they serve.   Even the music here is surprisingly good . . . If McDonald's weren't involved, it'd be hard not to give them five stars . . .
2	ap3PgqBHyMaMVeaQKoTSQ	Great beer, decent burgers, not great dinner...TOO LOUD ALL THE TIME!!  A place with 200 people doesn't need a crappy band to play way too loud. Last time I was there I found myself screaming to the girl across the table from me.  We were 2 feet away from each other and on the opposite side of the place from the band...and it was so loud I felt like I was in a club.  Lose the bands, improve the dinners and keep the beers great and you have a good place.  I had a jambalaya and it was just awful.  It was rice with some meat and a spicy sauce.  Not good at all.
4	LXVB4g2gh7nK216wrMwUOA	Perhaps the planets were aligned today, because the new horizon probe just reached Pluto, but these were the friendliest people dishing up pies!    My son has turned me on to their Brooklyn style pizza, and I have to say, it was good! Not gourmet good...but solid good.     Thanks guys for making my night with your cheerful greetings and friendly patter. "I"ll be back" because you just terminated my hunger! ( OK, terrible joke, But ya gotta admit yelping dominos is a little "puny".)
4	oX3V82RSe9RmTYE9bdpyA	with a name like presto, i was expecting italian food.  i stayed in charlotte, nc for a week and in a small walk from my hotel room discovered presto.  i had a garden salad which was accompanied by an entire loaf of bread on it's own mini cutting board, and the seafood jambalaya. everything was delicious. there was plenty of shrimp and large scallops in my jambalaya, the bread came with a plate of olive oil and herbs, and the salad's balsamic vinaigrette dressing wasn't too heavy.  next time i fly out to charlotte i'll most likely eat at presto again.
4	V7bqNsiV6lpCE63sjiYrAQ	Best greek place I've been too in the North Valley. They make all of their breads fresh. The chicken and steak is well marinated. Sometimes the Chicken can be a little dry. Overall, it's a great lunch spot.
2	Gt0ReIk1lfATS7Xk3jNNQ	This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30.   Overall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.
4	qz15d3j7OPmRdjpqXvT85A	Friday night fish fry- AYCE for about $11.00. I highly suggest making a reservation- this place is packed to the gills. There's a huge bar in the main room, decent bartenders and reasonable priced drinks. We waited about 20 minutes past our reservation because there was a large party being served, but onced we had a drink in hand, the wait was tolerable.   Seated, we were happily surprised to see how efficiently they run their fish fry- the tables were pre-set with a bowl of tartar sauce and a family-sized bowl of cole slaw, plus a basket with several slices of really tasty rye bread.   Three of us enjoyed perch family-style, with fries and it was really good- a lightly breaded well-cooked platter of perch and fries was easy to share with friends.    Looking around, it was a good mix of north and east-siders with an average age of well under 60, on the low side for a supper club.  Can't wait to go back!
2	IyrqRigU0i2YaXmZQmtmow	Been here a few times since it's close to my job. It's a typical fast food place. The food is OK but the service is awful. Doesn't seem like anyone here likes their job. Most of the employees here have attitudes and it shows.. I continue to go here only because they don't mess up my order that often and I don't really expect much from Burger King anyway.
2	xblc0y70XMs5lapQzEiQ	I am writing this a little prematurely.  I have been here once before and it seemed okay.  I am taking my husband here for his birthday tonight strictly for the view.  I made a reservation and the gal answering the phone spoke so fast and slurry that I couldn't understand what she said.  I made the reservation and she tried to hang up on me, but I stopped her and told her the occasion, since she wasn't properly trained to ask.  I asked her to make sure we got a river view (the food is not that good), she said I had to wait until we got there to see if we could.  Not good...
2	Hxtnw1sogdu0a9SQ3hg	The setting is lovely and the staff friendly, but the food is not what you expect from a resturant of this caliber. The flavor profile on each dish was off and odd. The steak was overcooked. The cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert. Very disappointing and unexceptable for a resturant rated this high. Yes, it's romantic, but for $79.00 per person prefixed entrees with $16-18 wines, that are also very average, it's not worth it. There are far better resturants in charlotte with romantic atmospheres.
2	2TPso8C3tmCyZahUG0pTrg	What a disappointment!  After reading these reviews and even hearing good (not great) reviews for a couple family members, we headed her this Sunday.  First off, I thought the service was mediocre to poor.  Not friendly, no smiles, and they never came back to the table except to take the order and deliver the food.  No water, no extra chips for the table of four, nothing.  My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros, which were okay, not terrific.  Congealed eggs versus over easy, but a big tortilla.  $6-7 bucks, so didn't break the bank.  I had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate, about $10.  Overpriced, greasy, and just not very good.  Gut bomb was more like it.  My daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $4, filling.  My son had a $4 or so bean an cheese burrito, again just okay.  Re-fried beans were paste, and more lard than beans it tasted like.  Rice was good, not great.  Anyway, not even in the top 1/2 of mexican restaurants I've been to.  Definitely not in the top 3-4 like many reviews seem to indicate.   I live downtown, so only about 5 min from here.  I really wanted this to become my favorite new place.    But when a place is in a just okay neighborhood, dirt driveway, and mediocre to poor interior, man, their food and service needs to shine.  And they just don't.  I won't be back.    By the way, If anyone wants to know my favorite Mexican owned and operated, not ritzy but excellent food place in Phoenix, head to Las Glorias south of Northern on 19th Avenue.  Better value, better food, better decor, and way better service.
2	gOdgNcchMmc8w0s6ACx3Cw	I have been saving money to get married recently, but we got a gift card for OTB, Chilis, Macaroni Grill or someother place I haven't heard of (Italian).  We always go to Chili's so we decided to go here.  I have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay.  The chips were okay and the salsa was great.  It seemed fresh.  We got good service and the fiancee ordered a margarita which was tasty.  I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I do at a more authentic Mexican resaurant.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga and rice and beans and the refried beans have not been my favorite and nothing about the experience was bad there, but I just have no desire to go back any time soon.  The service was good, but this place was sort of blah.  If I lived back in Pennsylvania, it would be okay Mexican food, but out here in AZ it is nothing to go crazy for.
2	c6jOvmmi5IU5i13U9ph66g	Now I love KFC in general, their original recipe & their crispy strips. Every time I go to this particular location close to my house, it's filthy, all the tables are dirty, the employees don't seem to care about anything. My biggest complaint is, now this is the second time this has happened to me at this location, I order a 12 piece crispy strip meal. I get home and there are 8 crispy strips and 4 boneless chicken with some breading that's spicy & my kids won't touch. Did they run out of crispy strips & just threw those in there knowing I wouldn't find out until I got home? If I wanted boneless chicken then  would have ordered it. From now on I will be going to the KFC on Silverado Ranch & Maryland Pkwy. The place is immaculate & the employees are efficient.
4	fx1ZhuUyuATeXZiKGA3mSg	The food was very very good. I had eggs and bacon and the bf had the big breakfast.  Eggs cooked perfectly and was filling. We did have slow service but we had a server who was brand new. 2 days in. Over all pretty good.
2	jr90QYXlAMpDwVnmeo0scQ	That was a really frustrating experience. We've been here a couple times by boat because the location is great. I'm pretty sure our server was incompetent. There was a wait for service, a wait for food but apparently plates are in short supply because the server was clearing the table while we were still eating.  That makes me nuts because it's rude.   One of the meals was prepared incorrectly and had to be remade and it took forever.  Sure they were a little busy when we got there but it was a ghost town by the time we escaped.    The incorrect meal was not comped as I would have done had it been my call. That was weird. I'd suggest eating somewhere else but I wish it was better.
4	0R35AOrxpHGexafHf425w	This place is good, not great. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try. The place does a huge take-out business. And the folks that runs the place are really nice. They will deliver but it always is 40+ mins. I opt for the pick-up which has never been more than 10 mins! Outstanding. They do the basics really well and if you order your meal combo style it will come with fried rice, chow mein, and what I call 'the bag of goodness' which contains an eggroll, a crab wonton, and a fried shrimp. It's like a full sampling of all things fried! Let's face it, it is never going to be on the diet so why not just enjoy.
2	EjxsE2WXBeRwsfY6vLkERQ	It's not really authentic. Maybe I'm not ordering the right stuff, it's barely good. If it was dirt cheap$ then I could give it an extra star. The service has always been pretty good and it's a cool spot for a big group. The food is just bland.
4	kA1lXDEoElp4L3PRaWK5tA	Wilson's... 4 stars for what it is... a local sports bar.  There is always parking available, they recently upgraded all of their TV's to new flat screens, and the locals and staff are always welcoming.  The price is right for the food they have to offer, although you're basically only going to get something deep fried or grilled up.  Stick with the burger or grab the fish fry... the wings suck, but they basically always do in the Midwest (sorry, these are facts, just sayin').  The best time to go there is when a Packers, University of Wisconsin Badgers, or Brewers game is on... especially when they're winning.  In other news, there is Karaoke on Friday nights, and a couple of pool tables if you're interested.
2	creoRu1TX7jb0U6oTsZeMQ	We decided to try Kabuki before a movie.  It sounded like a nice date night kind of thing.  The prices looked reasonable and there seemed to be a variety of dishes we would like.  Our hopes were shattered.  The atmosphere was loud.  Very loud.  It is customary for the host to shout when about to seat someone.  When the rest of the staff can hear the host over the din of the other shouting patrons and the blasting top 40 station, they shout in response.  We ordered the spider roll as an appetizer, but it came after our entrees.  The roll was good, nothing ground breaking.  The chicken teriyaki was tasty, but needed something besides just chicken (rice and salad on the side).  And they had good miso soup.  The rest was not so good.  The iced green tea tasted like water.  The tonkatsu was dry, and tasted like a mcnugget with barbeque sauce.  The salad was fresh from the bag?  The service was fine, but won't bring us back, especially in light of the food.
4	M688raU165YUdLXYUp2pg	Comfortable place that is our most frequent and favorite dining spot......if Norm and Cliff ever moved to Pittsburgh, this is where they would hang...........we like all of their food! Finding a place to park is my only complaint.
2	i8duUmvwY1ubn9LnVNIQ	The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving...
2	nRmEjSILqwmr2OUCvMkQ	Came here for lunch on a business trip out to Charlotte, NC.  I'm from California, so I had no idea what to expect when we went here for a quick bite to eat.    This place is situated in the middle of a shopping plaza-like setting.  We were seated promptly, however, there were 6 people in our party and we had to squeeze in to a table that normally fits 4 comfortably.  They do have a decent menu with normal lunch items you would find at any chain restaurant.  Wait staff was polite. Food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side.    Overall it was a fast lunch, nothing really special but also nothing really awful.  I'd suggest though that if you're looking for a nice lunch worth talking about then you should find somewhere else to go.
2	mN2K22IdDZGEs3MOu7Bvg	They don't deliver to the luxor.  After a long night, I didn't feel like leaving the room the next day for lunch. So me and my cohort decided to order some pizza, to help save some cash over room service.  As usual the menu look great and was very cheap. So I placed the order on my phone and went back to sleep, hoping to wake up to banging on my door with pizza being shoved at me.  About 30 minutes later I get a call from the driver claiming he couldn't deliver to the Luxor and that I would have to walk down to the taxi pickup to meet him.  At this point I could have just gotten lunch at the crummy Luxor food court for the same price with less effort.  The food was good as expected, but Dominos should really update their ordering service to let you know if you can't have your pizza delivered to your room. That is kind of the whole point of delivery... you don't have to put pants on.
2	WhJCoeeQy4zimSo4TzOSeA	The duck curry is tasty and the pineapple is definitely an interesting element, however we faced many frustrations when dealing with this establishment; from unspecified charges to the take-out containers literally splitting in my hands and spilling saucy mess everywhere...   There were many ingredients that seemed out of place in the curry and led me to believe they'd tossed a frozen bag of stir-fry mix into the pot rather than utilizing fresh vegetables. The texture of the shrimp used in their soup was completely off, like they'd been handled wrong (overcooked, refrozen, something). While the flavors were interesting, the irritations involved with obtaining the food and the distance will prohibit us from returning.
4	FWiyzzJOjNgIr9GNpZqgEw	I personally love this Taco Bell. It's right outside of my work so can get a quick meal whenever I have a break and just relax in their nice old school dinning room. I may even go a little too often as the counter people are starting to recognize me lol. I was going to give this three stars until I found out they serve breakfast now too! It's doesn't start until 8am for all you extra early people, but Taco Bell didn't open until 10am before this, so it's still an upgrade. Great location too in a nice sizeable shopping center with lots of other food and retail options!
2	MOicx2lmaKY5kBfxrF2WHA	I have been an avid Daphne's fan for years ever since I discovered this place when I was in college. It actually introduce me to Greek food in the first place which I have since expanded my horizons to some really wonderful mom and pop Greek restaurants. But I would still frequent Daphne's when I wanted to satisfy my Greek food craving in a pinch. Their convenient locations and fast service made it ideal when I just wanted to pick up some Greek food and head home.   However, times are a-changin' and it seems to be extremely obvious at Daphne's nowadays. My go to meal here was the shrimp & gyro combo plate. It always hit the spot with a little bit of everything. But lately, my combo has become a little less satisfying. The tzatziki sauce is now super runny/watery when it used to be perfectly creamy/yogurty. The rice is less flavorful and less fluffy than it used to be. The gyro meat seems to be more on the dry side and the breaded shrimp aren't so breaded anymore. Even the pita bread seems smaller and thinner. I don't know if these things were simply bad experiences for me or if they are, in fact, changes that were put in place to battle the trying economic times. Whatever the reason, it just isn't quite the same anymore. At one point in time I wouldn't have batted an eyelash at spending $12-14 for my quick Greek food fix but lately the plates that are being served just don't seem worth it anymore.  It's not always feasible to go to a sit down Greek restaurant because sometimes I just don't have the time or finances so I really hope that Daphne's will one day be restored to glory in my books.
2	pZwhd48n3BpHX3Dq2LWUQ	Came here for dinner because the hubs wanted to try out the AYCE shrimp.  I ordered the small filet (medium rare) with mashed potatoes, grilled shrimp and a side salad.  The filet was tough and took me a while to chew and chew ... and chew each bite.  The mashed potatoes were good, shrimp was salty and my side salad was decent.  The hubs got a filet with the AYCE shrimp - the shrimp were tiny. Probably bay shrimp.  And they gave very small portions.  He tried the scampi, buffalo and fried.  The scampi, if we were forced to choose were probably the tastiest out of the three.  We also ordered the cake pop trio for dessert and it was SO sweet we couldn't finish it.  The only good experience throughout the whole thing was that our server was very friendly.
2	VtnnpiOQwFcgkja8Molww	We just arrived in Fountain Hills, after a long days drive of 11 hours.  Naturally, we were starving, and needed something quick and filling to eat.  This Burger King is very dumpy, and looks like it needs an upgrade.  The guy who waited on me was very sullen, and didn't seem to care that customers pay his salary and keep the economy moving.  He just pushed the bag of food at me, and grunted "here you go" like I was a horse, or dog.  Anyways, at least the food was hot, otherwise, they would lose a star.
2	65mLWxh7g3WvH1Ao8tIVw	The employees were very pleasant & service was prompt. The carne asada burrito was pretty good. I little too salty but overall pretty tasty. However the rolled tacos had no flavor at all. The meat & guacamole had no taste, the beans it came with didn't have any flavor either. The only thing that tasted decent was the rice. Even the hot sauce was tasteless. I really wanted to like this place but my food was too disappointing. Unfortunately, next time I'll have to stick with my original plan of going to Del Taco, haha.
2	MbupjwYOmzy359wJhJ0Eg	"Paradise Lost Cafe" would be more appropriate.  I did not see Adam or Eve and I most certainly did not find a muse and I wouldn't go so far as to say that beelzebub works in the kitchen but it just wasn't that good.  Ok, all those references may be lost on anyone that hasn't pored through John Milton's book or at least the Cliff Notes but there it is like a broken marine mammal sadly marring a beautiful beach.  Skip it.  Even for late night munchies it didn't fill the bill.  Chicken fingers like overgrown kid's meal nuggies.  Blah.
2	gVfN2ceSGfNuqxZLk6g1Q	Not horrific , not the transcendental experience I expected based on their press , the fries were dry and floury in texture and the burger looked like it came out of a frozen pack although it was tasty.
4	P1S5AdAUT19yjkuGHkEayw	We work on campus and typically have lunch at Rainbow Garden once a week .... Tuesday is Rainbow Day!  Over the past 3-4 years there has been some variation in the quality of the food, from only modest to very, very good.  For the past year, though, very good to excellent has been the rule, with good portions. Strongly recommend as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area, as do most of the reviewers.  Don't believe some of the whiney reviewers on this site ... It's a Chinese restaurant for God's sake! You were expecting gourmet dining?
2	NKdXtCWEhGt7FlRsuTsYQ	Positive:  The food was prepared quickly.  We ordered the food over the phone and it was ready in 15 minutes.  Negatives:  It is not cheap.  I like a bit more wasabi and ginger and it was all an extra charge.  There was not very much included with our dinner.    Ordered Miso soup and it was in a large container, but was shocked to see that it was a quarter full.  I was really disappointed and felt a little cheated.
4	sOVLuFoBA0lXJMqgAYSuw	Game day baby! Good local chain that has cheapish drinks and a pretty decent menu that has a diverse menu for any pallet. The waitress we had was on point and the resteraunt was clean. Pretty standard chain.  Would reccommend if your just in a "lets go out" mood .  I had 2 different managers and shift supervisors come up to me and ask if food was ok and if they could get me anything.! Customer service was outstanding today.
4	mz9REMrrfMn6IAG4yQWbIA	I've ordered twice from this location and both the times the consistency of the taste of the food n on time delivery has been good... the pizza's were made well with good quantity of toppings n the food was hot when delivered n food was delivered within 30mins...so overall happy customer
2	Y0rDs8QEKgHAhlj1SuNQkA	Thought I'd give this place a try since it was near work and I love Thai Curry.  It was eh.  First, the soup was really bad, brown rotini noodles, brown broth, very unappetizing.  I ordered the beef curry lunch special.  Not much beef a TON of bamboo shoots, some sauce and fried rice.  The sauce was ok.   Next time I'm looking for Thai Curry near work, I'll search for somewhere else.
4	jLxoUgnGfKHSPK7gGa5LA	This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.    This place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style.  Soooo delicious!  Another favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!!  cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup.  I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever.
4	RqKNt1DQnsxXtZiex76g	My family often gets rosati's on birthdays!! Their pizzas have always been really good and their deep dish pizzas a freaking delicious. They are really filling. We have gotten a "meat lovers" deep dish pizza and a bbq chicken pizza there, along with other pizzas at different times. But those two have been the family fav.   Never have had any problems with delivery. Sometimes the deep dish take a little longer to make but still, worth the wait. Especially if you're having a party the wait doesn't seem as long. The pizza is good. It's worth it in my opinion. So if you want good pizza go there. Get the deep dish. It's fun and typically unusual to get deep dish. So have the experience.
4	q5pMLOocLgSxtFVoEnkuA	Tuscany is a fun course to play! I am always scoping out a great golf deal in Vegas in the summer. I play at 3pm in the summer. who cares if it's 107!? After about 3pm it's 19$ for a round that includes range balls, a cart with GPS, and two beers or sodas from the clubhouse. You really can't beat that price and the golf is great, too!  You should also know that Tuscany has an Iphone app. You can set up an account and make T-times right from your phone. They are on the way to Lake Las Vegas, but  not that far so stop whining and go whack a par! Now get out there and golf!
2	qKAJ1q5BkQuCUGTZY1O2g	We got a giftcard for Christmas so we thought we'd give Applebees another try.  My son actualy insisted I write this review during our dinner so some of this review will contain his words.  Caught up to hubby and son at Applebees after a PTA meeting and they had already ordered appetizers. The cheesesticks were pretty basic. Cheesy, crispy, and not bad though the marinara was bland. The steak quesadilla thing was decent too. I'm sorry I don't know exactly what its called...that's what son called it. It was like a burrito though and not a quesadilla but I don't care enough to go look. Again, the flavor was ok, but just not sure what to expect.  Dinner however was just blah. Hubby and our friend each ordered the Quesadilla burger. Both said it was totally bland. Hubby had coleslaw which was overdressed. Friend had french fries which were crispy and hot but bland. Hubby added mayo and ketchup and that still didn't help the burger though.   I had the 3 cheese chicken penne. Bland. Thank god they put diced tomatoes in it or there wouldn't be any color to it either. The pasta was overcooked and also appeared to have been sitting around in another vessel before I got it because it was very oddly bent for penne.  My son had a rueben. He's used to the ruebens at Archie's Deli which are A-MAZING. This one at Applebees was so very salty that he couldn't eat it. The meat wasn't fresh and the saurkraut was clearly from a can. He was very disappointed and after 3 bites informed me that I better Yelp this restaurant because it's TERRIBLE and people need to know.  Now the only saving grace was our server. I didn't catch her name but she was friendly, polite, unintrusive, and kept our drinks filled. She brought the food out while it was hot rather than letting it sit in the window and the crappy food wasn't her fault at all. That's the only reason Applebees didn't get 1 star.

I'm a little surprised they closed, as every time I was there they had customers, the majority of whom were seniors from Sun City. Granted I was there at breakfast/lunch time, I have no idea how busy they were at night.
2	QDnZ8t9jhdhomPaKETbGw	My friend really talked this place up so I was excited to try it, but we both walked out disappointed. I had the Chicken Italiano which is marinated chicken with provolone, spinach, and grilled onions.  This portion of the sandwhich was actually really good, but the bread was awful!  It seemed like it had been pulled out of a freezer. My friend was also disappointed in his cheesesteak, inside and out. The fries were quite tasty though :)  For $9 a sandwich, give me fresh bread!
2	cXrU0l76ozSiF8bvW9Rhw	I must be aging out of Cracker Barrel.  Maybe I'll get back to it, because there are plenty of old folks there.  But right now, they are getting awfully loud.  The service was good - in fact, one of the better rounds of service that I can recall having lately.  But I ordered some plate with a sampling of meat, and received one piece of bacon, a piece of sausage, some ham, eggs and one piece of toast.  For something like $7.  My wife added cheese to her eggs and grits and was charged separately for each - at $0.99 a pop.  I would rather eat at the Waffle House.
2	Y97bh1tbSe2SBz0sXZWz7w	Sonoma is totally forgettable. There was nothing wrong with the place, except for maybe the overly effected service (the waiter who responds to "thank you" with "thank you" instead of "your welcome"). If someone who loved this restaurant wanted to take me back I'd go, but I won't go there by choice again.
4	fkFRUPBOBTdCsCW0FrK9Gg	Update:   I was sorry to hear that a fellow yelper discovered my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix has closed. If anyone has any information regarding the owners (if they reopened somewhere else) or otherwise, feel free to email me through the Yelp system. They knew me by first name and I considered them friends with the level of service they had given me. I would love to know where they are now. I'm also sorry that I wasn't still living in phoenix to still patronize their business and keep them going (if it came down to paying the rent). I cant think of many restaurants I feel this way about. Good luck to the Mishima family wherever you are now.  below is my original review from 2006:   This is my favorite DL (downlow) Sushi restaurant when I visit the Phoenix area. I have very special reasons for this... The restaurant is owned by a Japanese couple that run the whole restaurant themselves. The husband prepares the food, while the wife waits on the tables. It is a real labor of love! I always enjoy restaurants where they remember me personally and treat me like family. This is one of those places!  The menu is almost limitless, Mishima San (Mr. Mishima) is trained in all culinary areas and make you almost anything you want (food stock providing). The Ox tail is particularly good, as is the Unagi Don (grilled eel over rice). Don't forget to try the Sashimi, if travelling in a group- get an excellent deal on the Sushi  boat. Most Japanese beers are in stock, so I usually choose Orion from Okinawa(light full bodied flavor). It is usually the hardest beer to find at Japanese restaurants. This is a small Izakiya style restaurant that has a family atmosphere, and the bathroom is clean!. Anything it lacks is well made up for with flavor and old world style Japanese hospitality. Oishkata!!! (delicious)... Enjoy:)
2	QFEeUB3UHpPjj0xBBRFqw	Listen, if you're going for the buffet you have to expect that its not going to be gourmet or always fresh out the wok. The foods not always as hot as it probably should be, its going to be a bit dry, and the hot & sour soup is on the salty side (for me to admit that says something) oh and there's no cream cheese wontons?!? The buffets saving grace is the sesame tofu.   I like the fact that its completely self serve - no waiting for refills!  If you're in a rush or trying to kill a hangover its not so bad otherwise there are other establishments you may want to check out.
2	DULuCPhsENF1s6snYqgTew	This was a real learning experience, with the economic times being what they are, my wife and I wanted a good meal, and fun atmosphere.  It had been some time since we went to Outback, we found out that you can call ahead and get your name on "the list", I knew that they did this for very large groups, but not for couples. Whoops, I was wrong... so call ahead and get your name on the list! We waited 30-45 minutes and finally got seated. Things started looking up until the salad came. They forgot the salad dressing, well, no big deal, we will flag down our waiter, but we didn't see him for some time, but another waitress came by and asked if everything was ok, and we mentioned that we would like salad dressing for our salad. So we drank our water until it was gone then our waiter came with the dressing and was so apologetic, he was sorry he forgot to bring it out, but right behind him was our main meal being served by someone else.  Ok, we had our meal, so we finished our salad, they my wife had the special, and I had the Melbourne Steak plate. This steak tasted like compressed sawdust, and my wife said her food tasted burnt. We were so disappointed that we just wanted to leave, we did complain to the waiter, and he said the manager would be over to talk to us. That never happened. I don't know if we will ever return to THAT Outback again.
4	k80TSuJ8gwcbtMqQFIkGQ	Amels is a great Mediterranean restaurant! First off, the atmosphere is so cute! The lights are dimmed, there's decorations in purple, orange, green, vibrant colors.The food is so good and the staff is very nice! They have a bar in the front that you can wait at and have drinks well waiting to be seated or waiting for others to meet you there.
4	ATXRNXH5mACVmWrVDlYlA	There are so many Asian restaurants, including the Chinese Cultural Center near by the office.  Little Shanghai has been by far the most consistent with the quality and customer service.  The delivery is super quick to our office (about 2 miles away), they never miss an order and the food is great.  I always get the Beef and Broccoli and the office usually splits a few orders of Pork, Vegetable or Chicken lo mein.  Very yummy stuff!  2 years later, still great food and service!!!!!!!!!!
2	DPKBshTy2XcleFZnNl7w	The little blurb when you select your star pretty much sums it up...Meh. I've experienced better.   While the place is usually packed at breakfast time, the service is blah and the food is a bit pricey considering it's just IHOP. The healthy choices are limited and like I said...meh....whatever.
2	TUmpRLyOQvDgrtB13JTdMA	Yelp totally led me wrong here!  This place is relatively inexpensive, but I didn't find the atmosphere charming or fun and the pizza tastes like something from a school cafeteria.    Granted, all I tried was one pizza but it really stood out as a place to avoid in a neighborhood with plenty of fantastic pizza and other Italian food.
4	b5GtaYnGFJ4e7vnAfezHcw	Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try.
2	K5YPfm1kGIibIceiZGkiUQ	I went here once because one of the Pitt clubs was doing a fundraiser here, and I'm not sure if it was just this location, but I wasn't impressed.   I got a pumpernickel bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was thin and pretty bland. There was barely any cream cheese on there, and what WAS there was poorly spread around.   The location is good and it's cheap, but you'd have better luck going to Einstein's bagels, or even getting a Panera bagel- instead.
4	fpNxvZVCt17ewFhUShmJg	It's Olive Garden. What's not to love? From the fantastic salad and breadsticks to the "Tour of Italy," this is a casual dining favorite for all.   This location is everything you'd expect from any Darden property. Good food and always excellent service. Is there better Italian to be had in the city? Sure! However you can never go wrong here!
4	sEKF36LaoLlvpsCGIQ0vXw	We had: excellent artichoke salad, superb oysters Michelina and veal piccata. As for the saltinbocca I was quite disappointed not to find at least one leave of sage in the preparation. I have been eating Saltinbocca from Brussels through Paris, Milano, Bologna, New York and Chicago as it is my favourite veal recipe but without sage it is not a saltinbocca. We'll definitely will return to this restaurant but I will insist on getting the saltinbocca as it should be.
2	lmAh5619f6SHGvh05aIw	Open 24 hours with minimal choices of entrees to pick from the menu. Not cool when you're out late...drinking like a fish and dancing till your feet hurt. After a good night out, I'm expecting something that will hit the spot and make me sleep like a baby after. Don't come here if that's  exactly what you're looking for.   Too bad there's really no late night spots in the valley. This is the time when I really miss New Yorks street vendors with ridiculous lines at 3am or Chinatown where you can eat to your hearts content & fall asleep in the back seat while someones driving you home or the diners where the menu is filled with so much choices but guaranteed a hearty meal or.....  What a disappointment
4	qg6keqtsGi2LlgZYA6KBmg	Great ice cream, great food, and great atmosphere! While I don't do the burger thing, they do have a great topping bar. You really get to have it your way.  The fries are crispy french fried perfection, and the ice cream is some of the best in town. I love this little area of town, so I'm kind of partial to any restaurant in the Hawthorne/7th Street area.   I don't know how long Snoop's has been around, but it has the air of a place that's been in the neighborhood for years. The staff is friendly in a short-order cook kind of way, and it's fast. It's a great place to stop for lunch, and it's close enough to uptown to be able to order, eat, and get back to work within an hour. That's always a plus.
4	1kOrcjTb4SLuap2fFqlkZw	Good food served up quickly at a reasonable price. We had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl (best I've tasted) , the California rolls (very good) and two egg rolls - all were very tasty. The establishment is clean and without many frills, the staff is friendly and quick. Who could ask for more?
2	NoEeuo5ee7E7crOuMsMA	When I go to a restaurant during prime time I expect results. I did not get them at Panda express at the mall. After completing my order they legitimately offered me something that was unavailable. When I accepted their offer of a crab rangoon they said "actually we don't have any you'll have to wait for us to cook more." No I don't I retorted, taken aback by the circumstances prolonging my insatiable hunger. Next time tie me up and gag me before you try to screw me Panda Express, your games do not entertain me.
4	x8C4eAAoisqNcb4hbusSQ	My friend was in the Service and had a craving for some Middle Eastern food so I pulled up Yelp and this seemed to be the closest in my area. I have driven by this place a gajillion times in the last 13 yrs or so and thanks to Yelper's I have learned that not everything is what it seems looks wise. It was 6:30 this Saturday we barely made it in time. It was clean I was happy to sit down inside and get out of the cold.  The server was pretty polite. The food took a little while but it was worth it. I had the Veggie Platter they were out of something they substituted with rice bit it was all good. Great humus and falafel yummmm I want more now lol I love love grape leaves and cant get enough now I know where to go to get my fix! The lentil soup was awesome and served steaming hot in this weather totally hit the spot with fresh pita bread. This was plenty of food perfect for sharing and I'm not even sure I'd ever order that plate for $12.99 on my own. My friend had the lamb kabob and some soup as well and no complaints here either.   They have hookah's and the good shisha my friend grabbed us some mint flavor which he love's I'm pretty sure its not any cheaper here than say a smoke shop. I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too. All in all I will be back to try some more delicous eats!
4	zAh6ZVUCF2T2ludveViZAQ	I have been eating their sauerbraten since I was a little girl.  I love this place.  I love the old-fashioned decor, the room setup makes you feel as if you're in an old house, and there is a piano that plays itself by the bar if you feed it a quarter.  if you're a first time visitor, i reccomend their wonderful sampler platter that allows you to choose 3 (i think) entrees and some sides.  superyum!
2	bq5fB4xXtnIzeca0JgkFzA	Pita Jungle in general gets 4 stars, this location gets 2. This location at night is packed. The tables are always so close together and they pack 3 million people in a relatively small area. Its on the border of a fire hazard. I would rather have some space and have to wait for a table, then to be packed like sardines. The loud music on the weekend is annoying. The food is phenomenal, but try the Mesa or Gilbert location.
4	Ns2QdrwMRHmaowZJ59nWxQ	Crispy flat crust, fresh tasting ingredients.  Artichoke/pesto/tomato pizza was excellent, highly recommended for the veggie minded or the plain old I like a tasty slice of pizza minded.  The chicken/sun dried tomato pizza was just ok.  And DO get a beer sampler - $4.50 for I think it was five samples of brew, which can be a steal if you pick your brews well.  Overall it totals up to over a pint. They had great Oktoberfest choices and several options of the wheat, pale, and hoppy variety (ahhh).
4	xuVFvIOdkGM45xf8eagg	I was staying at a nearby upscale resort and my date took me to OBR for Sunday morning breakfast. When he told me about the $3 breakfast, I thought to myself, "Geez, is this guy cheap or what? No champagne brunch?" But, he was right! The #1 was really good, certainly not something you'd expect from a place that is essentially a bar. It was certainly heads and tails above Denny's. He had the one w/ biscuits and gravy - rich and heart-stoppingly delicious (I had a bite). And, the service was friendly and efficient.   While the atmosphere is dingy and tired (but clean) as reported by other reviewers, it seems to all work together, including the interesting mix of patrons and wait staff. Even the just two choices of jam (concord grape or strawberry) seemed fitting. We were there before 10 am when alcohol could be served, so I think I missed the full OBR experience. I guess I'll just have to go back... It was one of the highlights of our visit to Phoenix, for sure!
2	YyB137R3qHO5vcRfeaJ0oQ	I was so excited to go to Sweet Tomatoes- had actually been bugging my boyfriend to go with me for a few weeks. Finally, we went on a Saturday for dinner and it was insanely crowded. It took us about 15 minutes to get through the salad bar and pay, before we waited another 10 minutes (while staring at our salads) for a table to open up to sit down. So, we sat down, I enjoyed my salad, went up for some soup (ick... not again). I was still hungry, but the thought of standing in the salad line again was unbearable.   There were many good options on the salad bar, but almost everything up there, aside from the lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, etc, (think pasta salads, potato salads, veggie mixes) was coated in a thick sauce, which takes away from the "eating healthy at the salad buffet" idea.    I've learned my lesson. I'd rather get a big salad from a sit-down restaurant for the same price
4	7ZA6gauDJrpsdtuA0VbGQA	Fast service, great wings, and homemade potato chips, when I'm going off the diet this is where I head. Go on a Tue or Thur they have .29 wing nights and not those sissy boneless wings, the real wings, the yummy suck on the bone kind!
2	4LrVaCoxs2kkRGGpX7Jvtw	I'm going two stars. Sorry Dan.  Had our meal ended after the appetizers (and before the "Water Show") I might be inclined to give it five.  As it stands though, the waiter upsold us on entrees we  didn't need, telling us our apps "won't be enough." Not sure what sort of behemoths he thought we were, but clearly he thought we had been without food for weeks.  Then the show started. Wow. That was hideous.
4	dBUb6oDHQb785zNqjuqcDQ	Food ans service was great.... But no public wifi and the ac in the restraint was too high and caused both of my aunts feeling so cold. As well I felt cold in the restraint as well....  Turn down the ac and provide wifi...
4	Laja8fcm10y9M0AkBvKQ9g	Whenever I am heading to northern AZ I always stop and grab a slice or a calzone at this place. It truly is the closest thing to NY pizza I have found in AZ. I know its in anthem it boggles the mind.
2	jYaLo80ocPZ3wY7awtTQ	Eh.  Their pizza is ok.  I bought a Madison Perks deal and took a chance to try them out.  The crust is incredibly thin.  I am not a huge eater and I ate half of their large before I got full.    Their sizes are not generously portioned out.  Their largest pizza is still pretty small.  We paid a bit extra for more toppings.  I got my usual sausage and green pepper.  I had one or two sausages on each square.  More like one on each truthfully.  It was very "chintzy" for lack of a better term.    I want to like them more, but they are just sub-par.  The only reason I did not give them a one, because the pizza was decent.  It tasted ok.  Nothing stood out to me.  I appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags.  It seals up the heat allowing you to get a better product home.  Thank you Buck's for the bag pizza.  Unfortunately, I will not be back again.
2	cEB1zbuTxHDJOhGRicVmNQ	Let me say it, I Love subway...not this one. Sadly its the closest one to my apt. Last night though, made me wonder just a bit.  Went with a friend to get a sub. I wasn't hungry, thank Jebus! My friend ordered his sub and when we got to the counter the one employee says to the other: "what's that crawling on the floor" under his breath. My friend and I pretended not to hear as we walk out...I so much wanted to turn around and hear what it was...but I feared I would loose my love for Subway... *sigh* I hope it was just...cricket or something from outside. My friend said the food was great though... I mean their store front was clean, everything looked fresh and tasty...just...can't stop thinking about the thing crawling on the floor...
2	8oTOg9TsMN0f1tycyV3bg	Worst Port of Subs ever! Slow service. Out of things at a reasonable hour! And the cashier just dropped my change on the counter. I thought it might be a mistake, but then she did the same thing with my receipt and my loyalty card. And I don't mean just placed the items on the counter, dropped them without a care in the world.
2	tLHPOcEpM7XNn4Z4o0VApg	I just moved to the area and had high hopes for this place. I ordered carne adada tacos and cheese enchiladas. The tacos were ok, but there was nothing special about them, and definitely not worth the price. The enchiladas were the real disappointment. The cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought. It is sad to say that I have had better enchiladas from the frozen food aisle.
4	cCvgTY8CqxieHc1DMNvfA	I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.   Got home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.   My two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a "K"  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a b\u00e9chamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the "Boss Lady" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it.
2	tRf2mgYBbvZp14n1FEXvw	No mushrooms? I can deal with. WAITing for a cold pizza! I cannot! much less a bad cold pizza!  wierd, cuz the Calzone was great!  I wasn't gonna eat it after the Pie, but at midnight I remembered it was still in my trunk, and I was hungry, it was paid for!  How can the pizza suck, but the Calzone be great? go figure!
4	XeXBeZwsyQoJ0MvBiYx1vQ	This place is delicious. Just as the other reviews say, the hamburgers are fresh and big ( I might even say GIANT ). The chili fries are just yummy, I made a meal just from them. My hubby gets the cheeseburger with jalapenos and loves it. I am having a hard time getting him to try anything else.  I am looking forward to trying thier breakfasts.  And just to make everyone knows where it is at, it is actually facing Lindsey Rd, with the cross street of Broadway. Just behind the Fry's market.
4	YyLDqbsMW9nOMjSFKgj8MA	I hate that I loved this place! After an afternoon of hiding from the heat in the Arrowhead mall, Ashley M. and I attempted several other chains in Arrowhead/83rd ave area that all had long lines outside before we came across Ajo Al's.  We walked in to the huge restaurant and were seated right away.  I loved the high ceilings and silly stereotypical Mexican decor.  Sombrero anyone?  We were then given the essential salsa and fresh tortilla chips (another reason I have a love/hate relationship with this place...) which just seemed to scream my name once they hit the table.  I ordered the Salad Carbon-Marinated grilled chicken grilled up and then layered over fresh salad greens and veggies with an avocado slice. Topped with fresh onions and shredded cheese and served with Jalapeno-ranch dressing on the side.  As a salad connoisseur, I was expecting far less than the deliciousness which appeared before me.  The chicken was absolutely delicious and went great with the whole salad!  I was very pleased!  1 star removed for being a chain, and for not removing the calories from the tortilla chips.
4	hbKun5WOmbkIONRFwWFdWA	Yes, Max & Erma's is a chain, but not all are created equal.  The Max & Erma's at 630 Stanwix Street in downtown Pittsburgh is a great place for a casual meal.  They have very good food and service.  If you hit there during rush hour skip the waiting list and go to the bar for faster service. They have great burgers, but I like the choice of a half sandwich and soup or salad.  I also like the frequent diner program, which gives you a 5% discount after eating there about 5 times and a larger discount the more often you eat there.  They also send you specials via e-mail from time to time.  On Wednesdays they give you two free chocolate chip cookies with your meal. On your birthday month they give you six free chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies are usually served hot, right from the kitchen and are delicious. Max & Erma's also has a great bar.  This location is just across the river from PNC Park and Heinz Field.  You can grab the T about 1/2 block from Max & Erma's and get off at the North Shore stop, which is between the two stadiums.  There is also parking on the North Shore that is less expensive than parking in downtown Pittsburgh.
2	QR3PeWzQmN21GsE9jLRgQ	Went to the Keg last night for our anniversary.  The first time we'd been there in awhile.  Really wanted an awesome steak so we headed there.    Service - A+ (Dani);  Bread - A+;  Atmosphere A+;  Shrimp - A+; Potatoes/Rice - A+;  Steak - D.    We both ordered Medium hoping for pink on the inside.  they really stressed that they wanted our Steak to come out like we ordered them.  They even have a complete definition of all the temperature options on the menu.  My steak was completely overdone and very tough, couldn't eat it after the first bite.  Hers was OK, a little too rare.  Gristle throughout.  Not just a little fat, this was gristle.    We went for the steak and were highly disappointed.  This was Black Angus or Sizzler quality.    They did bring us a free awesome desert (Mocha Ice Cream on Oreo crust).
4	MtJcyl78ABw9j2mHQzqQQ	L'amore was So good!  But like every place, there are pros and cons:  Cons:  The prices on the online menu are NOT the prices in the store.  I only had pasta, so I can't speak for the entrees, but a dish of pasta was closer to $20 a plate than $12.  The crowd was older.  We were the youngest people by at least 20 years.  However, if you ask me, it's a sign of how GOOD the food was (older people tend to have more $$ to spend on their meals, and thus choose better ones!!!)  Finally, it's a little far out of the way, but that's only because I live in downtown Phoenix; this may not be an issue for you!  That's all I got for cons!  :)  Pros:  The food was AMAZING!!!!  The portions are definitely large, and in all, are totally worth what they cost.  We tried the potato gnocchi with red sauce, the chicken fettucini alfredo, and the tortellini with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce.  I would HIGHLY recommend the tortellini, it's CRAZY how amazing it was!!!  The staff was nice, there was even some live music!  The setting is very romantic, but not too over the top (we went as a girls night, and even then it was still fun!)   Overall, it's totally worth the drive, and worth the prices if you are up for sharing (or it's a special occasion!)  Loved it!
4	RNRm1SccabnDy0pudhTY2Q	Outside this place looked like any other chain restaurant.   Inside a very very pleasant surprise.  It was amazingly beautiful.  Service was great.  They kept refilling my water.  I also ordered this chicken with broccoli and it was delicious.  They gave me so much broccoli I loved it.     Anyhowz I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.  Great chain restaurant if it is one.
4	ZlQAjAjLvPl6bGkFJrrGw	I am a huge fan of there Chinese Chicken Salad, the dressing is very spicy but really good. Make sure to get extra wontons there really good. I have bene going to Cocos for a few years now and evertime I love this salad.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because last time I went I got my salad to go and they put the dressing on it, that to me is a big no-no when you are getting to go food, it should always come on the side, you should not have to ask. The manager was kind of weird to when I asked for extra dressing.   If you are under 40 you might feel out of place, as this seems like the hopping place for 80 and over.
2	JyKqnoeWklvty75uM6P8Og	I really wanted to love the Dardanelles - they are locally owned by a progressive woman, and they serve Mediterranean and Turkish food, which is my favorite.    Unfortunately, though, on multiple visits over several years I have been continually disappointed.  Primarily this is because their food is not very flavorful and somewhat overpriced.  Although the service is gracious and the menu interesting, the culinary execution simply is not there.  There is a beautiful ceiling, and lovely art on the walls, and the lighting and volume makes it pleasant for an intimate dinner with a friend or two, or a 2nd or 3rd date.    The main dishes as a whole are bland and overcooked, and the servers are very hit-or-miss on basic information about Turkish cuisine and drink.  I should note, however, that my dining companions have enjoyed the food and found the whole experience just fine.  I probably hold this restaurant to a higher standard than I should, having spent lots of time in Turkey and the Mediterranean and savoring their marvelous foods.    They do one thing beautifully, however, and that is Turkish coffee.  If you go for dessert and coffee, The Dardanelles shines.
2	Jok4H26PYHsUI0lqLh5xnw	I was very disappointed in this restaurant. After reading so many reviews, I was  having a  high hope to find another good Japanese restaurant in Madison. Sadly the food is very bland, the sushi is not fresh at all. We ordered sushi for two and you can see some of the meat are cooked due to microwave defrosting.
4	zVhg83lyagW5TXTMHEUOQg	From March 2013 visit: the food was much better, good enough that I want to return. I had salmon, quinoa, spinach, pesto, bread (that's all I remember). I'm upgrading to 4 stars.  From Aug. 2009: The most disappointing thing about this place is the temperature: uncomfortably cold.  Probably 60 degrees (on a warm day in August!).  The whole dining area was cold; it wasn't just our table.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter he said there's nothing they can do about it; it's the hotel's cooling system.  That's insane!  Don't they care about the comfort of their customers?  The food was good, but the waiter did a poor job: he got one order correct, but they botched Jo's fish dish (she asked for the rice pilaf without tomato, and they brought her the standard rice pilaf with tomato), and they botched my order (I didn't order the prix fixe dinner, but they charged me for it (at a cost of $7 more), even though I communicated my order clearly.
4	0w9fWCmtgXcB1jrjDZjvQ	I have been to Marcellino at least 5 times in the last two years, the most recent visit in October.    The only thing that keeps me from giving Marcellino 5 stars is my spotty experience with the service.  On two occasions it took more than 30 minutes to get a check when we were ready; on another the owner/hostess was condescending.    The food has always been spectaular- 5 stars for the food.  The pasta and fillings are all freshly made.  Among our favorites: Paccatelli al Ragu di Salsiccia- this is one that my daughter has identified as the best Ragu in Phoenix; Gnocchi Sorrentina - the most dreamy-creamy gnocci dish; Lamb Chops al Balsamico- lamb can be sublime or awful- this was memorably sublime.  The salad with the pears and the Ortolana con Gamberi salad are also excellent.  The waiter's service was impeccible at my most recent visit~ attentive, knowledgable, professional and friendly.  I am pleased this was the case as I was hesitant to go because of my previous  experience with the staff.  On one occasion I brought one well-behaved child, on another brought two well-behaved children who enjoy dining.  It was the day I brought two children that I encountered the owner/hostess.  I arrived around 5pm (early- before the usual dinner crowd), and my children behaved perfectly (or I would not have taken them out).  The waiter was charming and attentive, but I felt that the owner/hostess was displeased that I brought children (who at the time were 9 and 10).  I paid full price for all entrees, didn't ask for special kid favors,  tip well and don't dawdle, and the kids were very quiet, so I was rather off-put that I would be be treated with veiled contempt.  I am sure that I will return at some point.  I woud advise the owners to consider tightening up their service, providing checks promptly, treating all guests with gracious respect, putting on the "make nice" smile when necessary.  Don't give a "bum's rush" to a customer with children who are behaving appropriately.
4	2O9OSTT11iJ4ofLxmtFow	Overall very happy with the sushi. Decided to go check this place out since it had a lot of great reviews. The reviews were right it is a hole in the wall, not much room for big parties their biggest table sits 6. They have a pretty big menu and lots of rolls to choose from, we ordered four rolls and shashimi, the rolls came out fast and they were all very good my favorite roll was the Amigo roll it was delicious. They missed the shashimi on our order so that is my reason for the four stars, we had to ask for it. Other than that this is a great place and was very impressed with the rolls. After Celsius closed down last year I didn't believe I would find another place that came close. Kaneya is very comparable and reasonably priced.
2	3jWcHIWl3TRbgXTy2mV8Q	Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!
2	hDzPenq690n3lfzi6cgtVA	We were hoping to find a good spot for breakfast on the far north side of town.  All of the good ones, aka Over Easy, Matt's Big Breakfast, etc are all south bound for us to drive.  Oak's Diner & Flapjacks was recommended to us by a local in Cave Creek.  It seemed busy enough, so our new breakfast adventure was a foot!  This place has a an older dinner vibe to it with loads of locals, you can tell by the hugs at the door when peeps walked in.  We were directed to a booth and told, "I'll be right with you".  At times these are the words I fear the most especially when places are busy.  Well, 15 minutes later I had to ask for service.  (I wasn't giving up on this place)  Someone showed up and took our order.   I ordered an all American-guy kind of breakfast - heavy/greasy and full of carbs!  I had eggs, hash browns and corn beef hash and a side of (according to their menu) award winning flapjacks.  My wife went healthy and order egg white omelet with spinach and a side of fruit.  My son had a stack of flapjacks.  We got our meal fast however we were grossed out by our server when we got our food.  She had the dirtiest hands I've ever seen on a woman, eeyuu gross!!  Food: ~ Eggs were fine, hard to mess up eggs ~ corn beef hash was like saw dust with no potatoes... Very dry and dust-like  ~ Hash browns were very basic and plain.  ~ Their flapjacks tasted, meh - Pillsbury or Betty Crocker taste as good or better.    End result of our breakfast adventure in Cave Creek is meh, still looking for a good breakfast place on the north end.
4	CkXJzreVFluKDhs8DGL89g	Great Malaysian food!!! The service and prices are just as good!  They are very accomodating for large groups, I have been to a few dinner parties here and it was wonderful. If you like sushi they have a great sushi chef on site, they also have a teppanyaki (not table side though).  Malaysian is their specialty and they do it very well.  My parents and in laws love this play too! Good for both meat eaters and vegetarians!  What I order:  Roti Canai Mango Chicken Nasi Goreng Sambal Shrimp Malaya Sizzling Steak Char Kway Teow
2	wPct0ebgiD3mLOPaFv5Fw	For some reason, I don't know why, I had heard that Pete's fish and chips was a Tempe staple...if this true I have no idea why.  I mean, sure, the place is extremely well priced (3 of us ate here for less than a Jefferson). But I guess you get what you paid for because when my order arrived I hadn't been so disappointed since the Lost series finale.  The "fish", i guess that's what I ate, was hard as a rock, I was thinking about taking it home to play street hockey with later...it was that bad and it had no flavor what so ever.  Our meals also came with some "shrimp" and again, the dubious quotations are necessary.  I have never ate "shrimp" like that in my life..it was a small amount of shrimp-esque mush fried in a few tablespoons of batter...and it was similarly unflavorful..unless you call grease a flavor, which I do not.
2	pieU6WAVXXhqg7NCmNpXw	We stopped here before heading out to Phoenix, Arizona on a Wednesday afternoon. When paying the cashier was having a problem using my debit card, how much trouble I found out the next day. The food was good, but they charged my card twice to the tune of $30.31. Not that its a tremendous amount of money but it has now been 6 weeks and they have yet to credit me back. I merely warn people to pay cash or have your money held hostage.
2	Ddg5bbp85wTDl5NkkHNihg	Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service.   I called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said "Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?" No, you can't.   Definitely won't be going back to this location.
4	4UYsEn3Z6iwMyeM1sKrRw	My husband and I eat here pretty regularly. Is "traditional" Hawaiian boxed lunch fare healthy? Not so much. Spam is on the menu, people!Think grilled or fried chicken, fish, or beef, sticky white rice, and the most delicious macaroni salad ever. I've not cared for the appetizers, frankly, but we have only tried the Spam musubi and the Crab "Langoons". We really like the BBQ chicken and especially the chicken katsu (breaded chicken cutlets cut into strips- dip into the fabulous zingy katsu sauce). They also have soups, burgers, and salads. The portions are quite large for a "regular" meal. I always make 2 meals out of it, but Hubby can usually finish his. Aloha Kitchen does a few things better (and also has great Kahlua pig on Saturdays which Ono never has), but for a quick and filling out of the ordinary weekday dinner, Ono hits the spot.
2	q6grPK6FbzrE5tRRvvD2DQ	Was fiending arepas so I searched Yelp and seems like this is one of the only places serving them.  You walk into a little Colombian market and the dining area is to your right.  I understand this dining area also becomes a salsa dance floor one night a week.  The photos on the menu look amazing.  I wanted to try everything.    There were a couple different kinds of arepas and they were decent, but none of them compared with really good arepas I've had outside of Vegas.  The empanadas were so-so.  They hard-sell you on their fresh juice - I got the tamarindo and it was pretty good.  For dinner I ordered the Sancocho de Gallina which is hen soup w green plantains, yucca root and a piece of corn on the cob in the soup.  The picture looked incredible.  But the dish did not taste as good as the picture looked.  Very bland and the cliantro wasn't fresh.  Also the yucca root was undercooked.  The plantains were decent.  The corn on the cob was the same sweet corn used in the arepas which was pretty good.  I'm not sure if I'll be going back.  Maybe if someone came from out of town and really wanted to go.
2	qg7K0a1AbIXGMDVVV64z2g	This Wendy's is located between work and where I go after work, haha, and its not that bad, sometimes.......  I have been to this location multiple time, thus the dukedom but unfortunately its more about location and accessability than service (and isn't it true that's the case with most everything these days "/) but I digress, the wait times are longer than average when you dine in or even if you go through the drive thru, and that makes me sad.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is the fact that I know that I will probably be back there, another thing that makes me sad.  There is hope though, every once in a while I get pretty good service so the silver lining is there but hopefully that shines through more often than not!  We will see as I said before I will be back and hopefully they suprise me in a good way!
4	QUWV63tddN0ihsfUVqQWg	I'm from the tropics, so I don't really bother with seafood unless I see the water.  Maybe it's people like me who are used to very fresh seafood that give this place poor ratings.  I on the other hand, stuck to "seafood-infused" items like pasta and fish and chips.  It's a great place to bring your kids and tourist friends to drink and get messy and have fun.  The menu could be improved, but we were still happy with our orders, especially with my tea vodka infused Sunshine Tea. YUM.  Must replicate this on my birthday.  Service is EXCELLENT.  If you're real nice, they'll give you the drink jars to take home.  Want to see some food porn? :-) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-crab-shack-las-vegas-2?select=yLUv1dh0WPNhhj0L9fQQ5w#yLUv1dh0WPNhhj0L9fQQ5w
4	RhuAclcyqUMxmUipjdfGIQ	Of all the Dairy Queens I've been to in my life in CA, TX and now AZ, this is the nicest and cleanest location I've been to. I guess that's what happens in Awhatukee.  The staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru.  I could eat Chicken Finger Baskets and Blizzards all the time! I'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer.
2	1LDEqBaNEEhdms9oO3RMYg	We eat here every few weeks and would normally give it five stars for good food and good service. I especially like that they have a photo of steaks in varying degrees of doneness. That is a big help, the steaks are cooked well and the salad bar is well-stocked,  but this evening Husband and I went in with plans to order lobster for him and steak for me. We were accosted at the door by a pushy loudmouth who started out by asking if it was our first time there and did we know the menu. We said yes and thought he would back off and let us read it. He kept on pushing, so I said I just wanted a steak. The menu is in English, which I read fairly fluently, but Loudmouth insisted on reading it to me, pointing out several features he suspected I might have overlooked and was frenetically trying to upsell me on the 2-for-one steaks without even knowing which one I might have chosen or investigating the fact that Husband didn't want steak at all. He wanted lobster. We gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering. We will go back eventually, hopefully after Loudmouth is gone.
4	L2ZwyxuNO3O7t3QFcyQeVg	I haven't been here in awhile, but I definitely miss it. They do hold slightly odd hours as it is a mom and pop joint and they are definitely more of a breakfast place than anything else. Their omelettes are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of their potatoes for breakfast and especially with their gravy. Yum! My boyfriend is more of a burger person but he loves their burgers and fries. They have a few breakfast specials that are just as awesome It is very small. And they do not take reservations to my knowledge. If you go on a Sunday morning you will def be waiting for a table. They never used to accept cards but to my knowledge they recently have begun taking credit cards which is a big plus. This is definitely a mom and pop place you need to try.
2	9iMjH6ICimgWjFaBbDX7uA	We got the Triple Treat; two pizzas and two sides. Bread sticks and the chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie was so overcooked that it was nearly impossible to eat.  Papa John's cookie is SO much better. Have never had a problem with theirs. When I got there to pick up my order, the guy said they burnt one of the pizzas and were making a new one, so I had to wait around until that was done. Don't usually have a problem with this location, but that night they definitely were not hitting on all cylinders.
4	yaPNGqlIYVvnszKBfNbRjQ	I have to tell you that I have never been very impressed with Claim Jumper locations before. They have always been known to have large portions, but the service and the food has just been average. Starving after a flight and getting settled into our resorts, we ended up here for dinner. The 5 of us all got a huge booth. Our waiter was quick to get our drink orders. We ordered steaks, a pot roast and a spinach chicken salad. Two of us shared to meals and the waiter was gracious enough to have the chef split both plates so that we didnt have to. Again, our waiter was great. It turns out he is from Marin and grew up in the bay area. It figures. He made sure we always had our teas and waters refreshed and was there for us when we needed anything. Everyone was more than satisfied with their steaks. The salad and pot roast were great. I think the veggies in the pot roast could have used a few more minutes, though. If you are having trouble deciding where to eat, are really hungry, want to make several different people happy, and are near here, I recommend checking it out.
4	PQlHg8bZMC83GEBMBtF0OQ	I'm always encouraged when sushi chefs have no idea what I'm saying and when other Asians patronize the place.   So when the Tokyo Lobby sushi chef stared at me blankly when I asked a question, I thought, oh my gosh, that must mean that he's like really Japanese or something.   And when the Sun City Asian ladies rolled in for lunch - its fate was sealed.  My sushi confidence shot straight up.  Nice!  For the past 3 years I avoided this place.  Why would any respectable sushi place locate itself in an aging dumpy Walmart strip mall?  I peeked inside way back when and wasn't impressed.  But after reviews of this place, I knew I had to check it out.  Wow, was I wrong.  This place holds its own against any Scottsdale sushi joint, without the flash.  It moved into its new location within the strip mall last week, and it's a bit bigger, more modern, but still modest.  My second visit (today) I tried the bento box - a steal at only $7 that comes with teriyaki beef, rice, spicy tuna, california roll, salad and miso soup.   And I've been stuffed all day.   The highlights here clearly are the inventive rolls - reminds me a bit of Blue Wasabi with cutesie names like the Glendale roll and the Monkeyface roll (crab, fried mushrooms and avocados).  Mmmm.  This has definite 5 star potential, I'm just waiting for my next visit.
2	cbJBE2eXHpQS3D0zyFiQNw	Overpriced Denny's.....the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and the prices were outrageous for what we were getting. The service however was amazing. I say this because we showed up here the first time at 4am drunk and the waiter was not only humorous, but was very attentive to my drunken ramblings. We went back sober, so I can with all confidence say hat food isn't amazing, although the french fries at 4am were pretty clutch. PS...not that this is a bad thing for a sober person, but that menu is daunting, to say the least, when you are drunk. I mean, so many choices, and I'm indecisive...yikes
4	NUZBZY8fj8UK8i8RWkQ1KA	This place is my favorite Liberty Ave Italian restaurant. The food is above average for a very reasonable price.  I've tasted almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet.  They have the best fried mozzarella in the city using fresh cheese and hand breading it on site.  This is a great place that everyone should try at least once.
4	tNLmPaP1YXQz7p6RgCsQ	It always seems like when you had something for along time you take it for granted , then it is taken away and you miss it. So it is with El Paso , I haven't always liked El Paso as much as the last two times I was there. The last two times great food and service.Great conversation with the Manager, then bam the doors are closed.  Talked to a friend in the know who had done charity events with them and he says that the chain has been hurting and the two AZ locations were the only two left. They say there is a small chance they may reopen but it doesn't look good.    Fair thee well El Paso , I barely knew you.
4	9kzfnDkuyIaGCAHHGyPRSA	My boss and I ate there yesterday. I really like their chips and salsa. We had the lunch specials. Chimichangas. I think it cost us 20 bucks for our lunch. It was pleasant and we got our food pretty quickly. I'd go there again for lunch.
2	1lcGeUFQGYwFMwHSIMM2Q	I bought two pizzas. One was the New Pretzel pizza and the other one was pepperoni pizza. I just got done throwing up.  I was just fine, before I ate the  New Pretzel Pizza.  I am very disappointed with the food.
4	YDSLdEpMxYz15zKkHKSmg	Best Pho in Pittsburgh. Way better than Tram's kitchen. Must try the fried shrimp roll.  Warning: closed on Tuesdays. Seriously, WHAT THE PHO? Don't make the same mistake as me, so check their website first to find out which day they close since it might change. And cash only!
4	ZuKkAgra4TbKGNURrkFnpQ	Wow, I can't believe these negative reviews.  I went there last week for the first time and I have to say that I thought that it was wonderful.  Besides some service blunders I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. My mom never had Mexican food before (GASP!) except for the basic Taco and Taco Salads.  She ordered the enchildas as did I.  Their salsa was great.  I loved my green chile sauce that was on my enchiladas.  And I LOVED the Sangria.  I got a litre of Sangria for $9.95. Can't go wrong there. Of course it isn't considered "authentic" Mexican food.  Who cares!  It still tasted excellent.
4	uBwhq4SNMMMai1kfmjrrdQ	Never even knew there was a Jersey Mike's uptown till recently.  I may just have to start putting this into my rotation.  I came in on a Tuesday for the Super Tuesday deal ($6.50 for Sub/Chips/Drink).  It was pretty packed and I was told normally it's more crowded.  Note to self, get there early as possible.  That wasn't a problem though becuase they moved the line very well.  The problem comes in if you are looking to take a seat and eat it there.  Very limited seating area.
4	jyHRdFfT7NenjU46RfUQA	Yes, this place is tourist-ie and yes, you do smell the longhorn on the way into the restaurant, but, as a tourist in Phoenix, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience (and food).  I went there with my wife, in-laws and three 11 year olds.  The kids actually donned their menu (which converts into a longhorn crown-like hat) on their own and went down the slide several times.  All of it (including the fried rattlesnake) is a bit gimmicky, but the gimmicks worked on us.  Their BBQ sauce was very smoky and savory.  I actually would have bought a bottle but forgot to do so before I left.  The rattlesnake tasted like chicken only tougher.  The steaks were cooked as-ordered (i.e., a medium rare = medium rare).  The service was good, and the kids loved having the balloon artist (he made a fire-breathing dragon, an armadillo and a sea turtle).  He was very personable and even provided a one-night warranty on blow-outs!  Of course, we had a nice view of the city, including a lightning storm. Was the food the best I've ever had, probably not, but the overall experience is definitely worth a trip.
4	1eBcJAKnuOObXYtyCaqvQ	I tried this place for lunch the other day and it was pretty good. The slices are huge!  I usually need two to fill me up, but two was almost too much for me at Venezia's.  I could've just as easily been satisfied by one.  I got my slices to-go, but the inside looked nice and clean.  It's a good place to grab a quick bite.   What I really like about Venezia's is that you can put whatever topping you want on a single slice of pizza, instead of having to choose from what is already made like at most other pizza places. They just put the topping of your choice on a cheese slice and pop it back into the oven.  Also, there was a nice amount of sauce on the pizza, I hate when there is no sauce!  The only sorta bad thing I noticed, which is probably to be expected when eating pizza, is that it was extremely greasy.  Even my coworkers commented on how greasy it was, but they didn't seem to care anymore once they tasted it!
4	FIsqFvXLiSzM1MolFpckg	Lived in the valley my entire life...never once been to Pete's.  A couple of my co-workers begged me to go.  They praised how good it was..even have the bumper sticker on the wall of their cubical.  Fish tacos were actually REALLY good and the burger was large for a 1/3lb.  I was quite impressed.  I'll be going back!
4	TmCZaNS85qW1q6ZYPdYoCw	Can't really say anything about the place that hasn't already been said--great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere, best bar food I've ever had, killer fries, Kiltlifter's great, 8th Street Ale's pretty good, blah, blah, blah. . . it's all true.  Actually I take that back--try the stuffed chicken if it's on the menu. (it's a special) It's effing awesome.  This place truly does have the best bar food. Anywhere.
4	XPtnmnrOzqufrMnz0QRQ	Dells pizza is the best in town. The crust comes only one way & my favorite toppings are beef with green chiles, the cheese is layered nicely. They have good wings & other bar foods too that are good. The pizza burger is pretty good.
4	hZKJ6AYt0eCEA4f4af5Rog	WOW! I LOVE this place and I can't believe it took me this long to check it out.  The interior is incredibly original and equally funky and cool. The menu is mostly sandwiches of which are not may favorite ... but they have a great beer selection and it's a super cool place to hang out.  Big ups!
2	BAF6TT72i1tXUI7zA7PzA	This "Mexican" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.  The crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.  Their quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.  The chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.  Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping.
2	SF0fvcbZEMW6UOFfdlWNuw	My husband and I keep trying to find "the" Mexican place.  This wasn't it.  It was just alright.  Not great.  Not bad.  Not worth it.  The place really needs a few coats of paint and some cleaning up.  I did not enjoy squeezing my salsa out of a dirty ketchup bottle either.
4	AsqkG0O0ZLwMiS01PVgBpA	When it's my turn to cook, I pick up the phone an order Fuzzy's. Thin crispy crust pizza sliced in easy to handle squares - just the way I like it. I have had the opportunity to enjoy Fuzzy's dine-in, pick-up and delivery numerous times over the years. The owners have changed a few times and it has always been consistent.   Fuzzy's is as close to Chicago-style pizza you can get without a plane ride. Vienna dogs, Italian beef , wings and pan pizza options are available. Chicago sports memorabilia and bold colors mark the decor.   Good prices fast delivery gets a hot pie to the door.
2	jSg8WMWccNd9BbzlPPSEow	I had Christmas Eve dinner here with my parents. I'm not a huge fan of chains, but that's where my dad wanted to go.  Both of my parents ordered the soup of the day which was lobster bisque. I tried a bite and it was decent, kind of rich.  3/5  My dad ordered a full rack of baby back ribs. They were very, very tender and good. I wasn't in the mood for ribs, but after I tried his I wished I'd ordered the ribs. 4/5  For sides my dad had cole slaw (fine 3/5) and ranch beans (kinda sweet, okay 2.5/5).  I had the salmon and shrimp picatta. It okay, but I wouldn't order it again. I didn't care for how the salmon was prepared and the sauce wasn't very flavorful. 2/5  For sides I had rice pilaf (good, nothing special 3/5) and creamed spinach (would not order again, didn't taste good and a major disappointment since it was listed as a "premium side" 1/5).  My mom ordered the fillet medallions with bleu cheese and wild mushroom topping. They were fine but certainly nothing to get excited about. 2/5  She had the loaded mashed potatoes. They were pretty good and were the best of the sides that we tried. 3.5/5  The service was not great (2/5). The waitress was overly chatty and seemed kind of flustered or something. Also, she kept fanning herself when she took our order and told us she was having hot flashes, which I didn't really need to know.   Overall, 2.5/5.  The only thing that was really good was the ribs. Of course, that's what they're known for. Definitely recommend getting the ribs if you go here. Everything else, meh.
4	kQc0DSEoesgX2ziQMGmglA	Panera is the best option for "fast food" in my opinion. I love Panera for lunch and dinner.  It's hard to go wrong with Panera. You can eat pretty healthy here if you try. Not everything is healthy, but there definitely are options. I also like that they use fresh ingredients and antibiotic free chicken.   In my opinion, you can't go wrong with their soups, they are my favorite. Some are better for you than others like the vegetable pesto and black bean soups however, if you get a "you pick two meal", you can splurge on the less healthy ones like creamy wild rice and chicken. What is a you pick two you ask? It is a meal you create by picking two items from soups, salads, sandwiches, paninis, and pastas. You get a half of each selection that you pick, which is nice to try some of their different menu items.   I feel like their breakfast treats leave more to be desired and their coffee is so so. I generally wouldn't come here for breakfast. Their pastries do not have enough flavor to me, they taste rather doughy. For this reason alone is why I am giving them four stars! Other than that, they are great!
4	3gOrcTxgD90sAFP5mNLLgw	Harpers has a nice bar area if you want to catch one after work.  The service is consistently good and their BBQ pork is excellent.  I have dined there 10+ times and have always been satisfied and so have my guests.  It's a good atmosphere in the bar and dining areas.
4	JaLMC6KUIVwEAWm6CSLGng	This little gem is tucked in the HT at Arboretum beside the Starbucks. It  has been around for a long time, but they are still churning out some really good quality take-out.    The owner and his wife are very friendly and always have a smile and time for a little chit-chat.   We usually call ahead and the food is always fresh, hot, and ready to go. The portion sizes are good and there is usually enough to take the leftovers to lunch the next day.  I sometimes place an order for take out while I am shopping and they get the food prepared pretty quickly.  They have great Chinese and Thai dishes!
2	iNKF3KKHwVTn3CSivgjkDw	Not so clean, both the facility and the workers.  This place has been here forever and they do make a good toasted sub.  They should, they were doing it long before toasting was an option at most chain sub shops.  If you can get past the cleanliness, the food is not bad...although I do wonder about the hygiene practices in the back where they make the subs.
2	hQ50jhNEZaByeaZMwZ1ZVg	so the bartender was nice, and the beer wasn't pricey, but still. when i walked in, a thought came to mind that I can honestly say had never hit me before walking into any other bar.  "that guy who runs bar rescue would have a field day with this place". There's so much potential for a bar at that location, but something about it just feels like management doesn't care/has no interest in making it a remotely popular place. I think I only know two people who speak highly of the place, and all of their friends disagree with them. I want to love this place but it's just so darn divey that i have to believe there are health code violations of some sort there.   I'm totally willing to believe that a year or two ago, this was a fun and popular dive, but I got the feeling this place was on a sharp decline.
4	PAqa2s9xDqeHRZ16A30FQ	Difficult to find...take the elevator up to the M level.   No decor inside...feels like an old cafeteria, and the location sucks, but the food is really good...it would do amazingly well in a better location. I went for a workday lunch; very good menu and my friend raved about their Turkish pizza.  I'd recommend ordering online/ordering before you go, or else you might wait a little while.  I got their grilled chicken salad and the chicken they had on it was some of the best I've had downtown.
2	QQ5xUDoKX7289ClojcpVA	Ordered their new Turkey Cranberry panini without bacon, and I got one spinach leaf, a dab of cranberry sauce and a mediocre turkey lunch meat slice for $8... Not worth it. Very disappointed. Good orange juice though.
4	CPtnnUXYodqmRtEwrSXyFQ	Great lunch place- I've been to this location a few times for lunch and it's always slow enough to get in and out of but not so slow you are skeeved out to eat there.   The lunch specials are the right size, the right price and they are fast. If you want to hang out for a while they keep filling up your tea (the best way to get in good with me) or if you gotta run, they hook it up.   I think most everyone already knows the Streets of NY menu and the food here lives up. Good stuff, consistent, fresh and yummy.   That is all!
4	IhZMi8WqRGcHB0akZrYkdQ	My husband works in the office building the Bean is located in, so we happen to frequent quite often.  Sometimes lunch, sometimes just a snack after work, and on rare occasion we grab breakfast there.  Their muffins are absoultely wonderful; especially the cinnamon chocolate crunch.  The croissant menu is fabulous, and the grilled cheese is delish.  My very favorite part of the Bean?  Ginger Peach Iced Tea.  Oh yes!  It is to die for. Tends to be pricey, but I'm hooked on the $2.50 iced tea, so what can you do.
4	vf8CsIirkuVaILdFlmPvog	Went for brunch today - Nice place!   We've been looking for a place to rival The Mission in San Diego (planned trips around their breakfast!) in our local area... This place is a definite contender - and not even expensive!   Coffee was strong, french toast was crispy and sweet... The BF had a yummy skillet that was very tasty... will definitely be back!
2	L11YOblpo7jKgEw5CS5Rvg	I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls. Today saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth.......... I've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.
2	UwajPMemyA4Kx8Y0CI1YXg	I came here because I was craving Chinese and didn't feel like going to Panda Express. Wanted something quick and close, and I've eaten here one other time, so I gave it a shot.    The food is okay, and the place try's to present itself like a Panda express.  They have crab Rangoon, and it's set up where you can get a variety of different things. The food is okay and the prices are good, but the last time I came here the service was awful.  The guy was filling to go orders while a line grew like 5 people long. I didn't mind, but he was sorta crabby when he waited on me and I had to tell him I wanted orange chicken like 3 times.  The food was okay, but nothing spectacular.  He also had a hard time making change when he rang up my order.  My bill was $6.77, so I gave him $10.02 so I could get $3.75 back. He was confused and tried to say something back to me.  The other lady working came and helped him figure out how to ring up my order.  I don't mean to suggest that he's stupid, but after his crappy demeanor, and now he can't figure out change, maybe waiting on people isn't the best idea for him.  Overall it was okay. With all the light rail construction, I went here because it's literally across the street from my apartment, and I wanted something quick. If you want better Chinese, go to panda express.  The food isn't bad, it's just not great...and questionable service as well.
2	6zjq0VGpTBDWybWZIwp7MA	We've been to the Pineville location before, and I have to say that the experience there is many times better than this one (at least on this night).  While everything was decent, nothing really came together.    The jazz band was decent, just don't make the mistake of sitting in the same room if you actually want to enjoy your meal, talk with your companions, that sort of thing.  If you're going for the music, that's fine, but for a quiet evening, it is not the room to sit in!
4	b7mzUyDf6Snhi7fxHRMQ	Miguel's is great.  This may be difficult to locate for people that are randomly looking to stop somewhere, though.  The good is very good tasting tex/mex.  The service is just fine and attentive, I've not experienced any customer service issues here.  They have combos and affordable food if you want something cheap; otherwise there big entrees are good and still not a wallet buster.  I'd recommend this place to anyone on the west side or anyone making the trip South on I-85.
4	Kna1sqpdUp7Lt7vHzAejfQ	I'm a new fan of the Outback Steakhouse. It probably had been ten years since I had last had it until a couple of months ago. Now I have been there a few times and I plan on going back. I love ordering the shrimp as an appetizer and I have found that the Filet Focaccia Sandwich is awesome! I am not a steak person, so this suites me fine. Eating here can be a little expensive, but I really like the food!
4	0k2zbu091JLXgxxieCutcA	When you're craving a good fish plate for lunch.....Showmars is always on standby and they never disappoint. The flounder is their specialty which includes regular fries(or sweet potato), slaw, and hush puppies for $7 bucks. What's not to love?
2	RSveQfqaBXrj4gjzzKDUw	Wanted to see why the reviews are so high for this place.  I have to say it was an experience to try at least once while visiting Pittsburgh.  We sat at the counter and that was a fun to eat there.  We shared a Pastrami sandwich and I thought the meat portions were small, mostly cold slaw and fries in your sandwich.  The pastrami was average and I would have liked more of that then the other items.  It was a big sandwich and enough for us.  We didn't have to order any fries, but we forgot it was in the sandwich.  The fries could be crisper and I thought they were tasty, but too soft for me.  Overall, I say go there once to experience it.  There's not a lot of attention from the staff, bc the place is so busy.  I don't need to go back.   If you miss getting a chance to eat there.....then catch it the next time you visit, not a must to visit.
2	BiXJ6sENlOcryeQh6DSww	This restaurant was clean, and nice, the service was good. However, stay away from the bun bo hue, it was a disaster. I've never tasted anything so horrible!!! The pho was decent though, I've never tried anything else there. I will probably not come back.
4	48qDkDyVAzE39VSSwDB1Q	This place was exactly what we needed. After hiking three days in the Grand Canyon, we wanted good, solid Mexican food in an unpretentious atmosphere. We also needed a place close to the airport. The staff was friendly without being fake, location was good, and food did not disappoint.
2	ThArobM1HYUIx2ZJcy4kw	I love CPK.  I have had great experiences at the CPK in Chandler and Scottsdale.  However, this location scorned me twice.    I always, always, always order the Tricolore Salad with the dressing on the side.  It's so good!  When I went to this location several weeks ago, I noticed that I was skimped on arugula, and a lot of it was wilted.  The salad was mostly those thick red leaves I don't like.  Last night, again, they skimped on arugula and it just didn't seem like a fresh salad.    Keep in mind, between those two visits I had the same salad at the Chandler location and it was delicious.  Lesson learned.
4	CISmlshpoGFIPTzP7KAM8Q	I forgot how much I liked Miracle Mile Deli until quite recently when I realized I've been going there about 3-4 times a month.  In fact, I was astonished to find that I hadn't written a review of the place yet.  So here goes... First off, the food is served cafeteria style.  I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is "The Straw".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try "The New Yorker".  It's similar to "The Straw" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.  File this one under my "Best Lunchtime Eats!"
2	sXb1NKHatGAwQUeQMAQCg	I normally wouldn't write a review for a local chain restaurant like Eat n' Park.  In fact, I really try not to eat at any chain restaurants, but Mom and Sis' like the french toast.  So, the reason for the post... I went there today for a late breakfast with my family.  It's a sunday morning, so we expect to wait.  That's no big deal.  We wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and are seated.  The waitress arrives promptly and since we're trying to make it to a movie we place our order right away.  She seems nice at first and the coffee arrives quickly,,, so far so good.... 10 min, 20 min, 30 min... and no refill on the coffee or water, 40 min...waitress comes by to tell us it will be right up, 50 min, 55 min.,  looks like we're missing IronMan and I'm gonna be forced to endure the Patrick Dempsey chick flick... finally Mom gets up and finds the waitress who argues with her that it's only been 25 minutes... (Huh?).  Then says she'll send over the manager.  The manager arrives tells us they are really busy and her other manager is in the back cooking(Umm, sorry for your troubles, but having the waitress argue with the customer instead of a simple sorry has nothing to do with you being short staffed).  She offers to pay for our breakfast (which is now lunch due to the wait)... Really!  You'll comp. the $3.99 Breakfast smile.  How Generous!  No thanks, you've just wasted an hour of our lives that we'll never get back.  We leave and I'm  stuck eating goobers and watching the McDreamy flick.    The food is what you'd expect.  Nothing worth commenting on and as I just mentioned the only thing I got to try today was the coffee.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is for my childhood nostalgia for the smiley cookies.
2	CPRM0pWDZcCBX59CCXOXZw	This is an extremely average bar serving extremely average bar food. While, after a liter of German beer from Essen Haus next door, the sliders I ordered tasted delicious, I recognize that they weren't really much different from sliders that you can get anywhere else. My steak ones were extremely juicy and tender, while the chicken ones resembled cardboard. My friends' burgers as well as the cheese curds we shared were all average, reminiscent of the kind you'd get at any other bar.  I wasn't especially impressed by the atmosphere. It was just a loud, crowded bar with your basic bar decor and Madison bar crowd. Our waitress also either got high before work, or someone decided her first day on the job should be on a busy Saturday night. She screwed up several parts of our order and didn't seem to be very familiar with the basic etiquette of being a waitress, like when to show up and when to walk away. None of it was too serious, but what really got me is that she didn't know anything about any of the beers on the menu. You work at a bar next to a German biergarten. Seriously?
2	AAtFJsewvbBm4D4fUB6DQ	I did not want to eat here I know better but sigh it's not always my choice. Nothing special here at all except for currently you can super size your margs for just pennies more. The pomerita on the menu is the only marg thats made with Cazadores very yummy hekk yes I say way worth it!! The salsa was eh with no heat or any real taste, this became the theme with the rest of the food through out the night. Spinach con queso was ok. I had the carnitas and the only thing I could taste was salt and way too much of it. Guacamole, rice and beans were pretty bland. Again, I didnt come in with high hopes but this dinner was something I wont be repeating chain or not I still have standards for good tasting food and this has not been it for ages. Sorry 2 stars here for drinks.
4	PKyDHLs3HMyKRRJC0ibQvw	GET THE BREAD PUDDING!!! ...This is a nice restaurant that is cramped and casually decorated. The food is the stand out. The front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task. The waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu. Food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time. You can see the chef and the kitchen through the window, which is always fun. Their red sauce has a bit of spicy heat to it.  My wife and I really do like this place for its great food and for its character.
2	MOzs09wHceOQQbvuEIWRwg	Went here Saturday night with my hubby, nothing special about this place.  We were looking for a casual sit down place to have a late lunch/dinner.  We remember seeing this places BBQ sauce in stores, so thought they might have some tasty food.  We got there and we had to wait ten minutes to be seated in the bar.  They had some flat screen TVs to watch but the place was super noisy... we could hardly talk to each other even sitting in the same booth.  We both ordered different dishes... I ordered the catfish with some fries and a side of beans.  My husband got the two meat combo, which he got the brisket and something else, they kinda tasted the same though.   We got our food and it was pretty bland, I guess that's why they have like 5 or 6 different BBQ sauces located on the table for you.  We tasted all of them and wasn't impressed.  The Devil's spit that was supposed to be the hottest one was mild, weird...   My fried catfish had a soggy crust on the outside, but the side of beans were pretty good.    We probally won't come back, due to no flavor... it didn't work for me...
4	LzPlYHferU4I5RO0znZA	I am a super fan of Del Taco! This is the cheapest, yummiest place any time of day! Whenever my friend and I go traveling this is the place we miss the most. In Europe they dont have Mexican food (well they do kinda but for some reason there is no spice and it is all made of kidney beans and corn... yuck!) and the first thing we do when we get home is head to Del Taco for the comfort of their yummy, cheesy  Half Pound Bean and Cheese Burrito with Green Sauce for $.99 and the Chicken Spicy Jack Quesadilla for like $2.79 or something. When I went to visit friends on the other side of the country recently, they were talking about what they missed from back home and inevitably it was Mexican food... specifically Del Taco. I almost cried when I found out that Del Taco isnt national. I think I am addicted to the stuff because I just cant do without it. The best thing is that they are open like 24 hours a day. They have hot cinnamony Churros for $.99 too! If you are doing something like Weight Watchers too they have a regular Bean & Cheese Burrito that is like 6 point or something I think. I read it somewhere but you can check it out.  Even so If I die from a Del Taco heart attack I will die happy!  Hey one more thing DEL TACO EMPLOYEES PLEASE BE CONSISTANT! The portions and flavors lately have been inconsistant. Thank you!
4	Hf74SjBeyAfL0rpJalO0Q	Driving from Phoenix to Las Vegas and wanted something to eat that wasn't fast food. Found this place on Yelp advertising fresh homemade everything - desserts, food and ice cream. Great service, yummy fresh food and the ice cream shakes were delish!! Highly recommend it!
4	hrvL0pcWXeN3JZ4edJa2Q	I have to say that I love the burgers at Red Robin.  They have a great selection and come with unlimited fries.  I like the burgers so much that I never tried anything else, however, my wife loves the whiskey river barbecue chicken wrap.  They also have a lettuce wrap burger that my wife gets sometimes to keep carbs down.  The service is a little hit or miss.  It is usually pretty good, but not great.  This is especially true if you get seated in the bar area in my experience.  Red Robin is one of our regular places to go because of the reasonable prices and great burgers.  BEWARE - Tuesday night is kids night!
2	lcPj23aXdI2xzjgqUqA	had not been to this Fuddruckers for a few years even though it is less than a mile from my house. It was ok...nothing special, not anything that would bring me back for another three years. Used to really like their onion rings, but those have changed and were a little too greasy for my taste. I had Turkeyburger. Not a whole lot you can do to make this outstanding. Place had been remodeled since last time we were in. Not sure what they are going for as a theme, but again, nothing special or memorable.  Do like the soda machine that give you a hundred choices...
2	W6zRWB8m4diSHMvYAKhDQ	This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites.  It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.  The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here.  I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well.
2	BlpBKbP26Q5M97ZgHFsjw	So, I admitt, if I could have breathed or even moved when I walked in I am sure I would have enjoyed the band... I like country bars, I really wanted to like this one too because it's so close to me.   Golly gee wizz cowboys... it's too packed! If you are not big on crowds don't bother going on the weekends because they pack you in like a can of saradeans. *true*
2	iMoohcItGYJpBKvepnGrw	I have ordered twice from here, because they deliver and I can't leave work to get food...  It is mediocre at best.  First time I wanted a "mexican connection" but apparently i have an old menu so I got a burrito that was supposed to have eggs, peppers, avocado, salsa - it comes w cheese n sausage too but i didnt want those ingredients..  Anyways, there was egg and avocado, a little side of salsa and thats about it, oh it came with hashbrowns.  The hash browns suck.  Today i ordered biscuits n gravy, asked for my hash browns crispy, they were not crispy.  They sucked again.  The biscuits were chewy and somewhat hard, gravy bland.  Did i mention the hash browns suck?  I love hash browns, thats too bad.  Got coffee too, it sucks.  Second star only because they deliver.
4	T8vlT6IZd46ZnMwaN3QWg	Just grabbed an epic burrito.  This thing should come with a warning... I honestly could not finish this thing.  It was so delicious!  I think it was less than 4 bucks.  I'd know for sure but we weren't given a receipt.  The guy at the drive through was very pleasant & quick.    So stuff!
2	N9DGiCah1OWUS09Pohf1g	I have eaten at many Romano's Macaroni in and out of AZ.  The quantity and quality of the food has been decreasing over the years.  I am very bummed out about this.  During lunch, my brother and I ordered dinner portions.  When the food came out it was more like lunch portions.  1/2 a chicken breast for the chicken parm and a handful of noodles on a huge plate.  My pasta milano was 1/2 the portion from previous visits.  Our server was awesome, attentive our entire visit.
4	K488PLBpyDOhRQrDrmFH8Q	My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout "Eat here" to me.  But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here.   I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the "breakfast" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful!   The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.  I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!
4	oOYNDXifZVRqQ8YzSIA	We had a very great experience at the subway on N. 16th in Phoenix, the two young men who were working on this day were so polite, made our sandwiches exactly as we wanted them and they were great.  We will definately mention this to their GM, and people in the area should check them out.  $5 for a footlong, a great deal.
2	r7yYMeuwt6EsdjiA4KiQ	Mediocre food with not so great staff.  Dined here with a pre-ordered party of 20.  Food was ready for us--laid out on a table next to our party and getting COLD.  One not very articulate server made for even more difficulties--it's not as if his job was really hard, the order was already made he just had to hand it out courteously.  I was here once before on salsa night-wasn't too impressed either.
4	gipiH2g0K1t1o9HQ6i5A	Day 2 of Az Restaurant week fared sooo much better! We made reservations at Top of the Rock. We had been there about five years ago for some occasion....birthday or something. We remembered it being good and the view to be fabulous...and we were not disappointed once again. We were seated immediately and our server (Rod) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. He was thrilled we were there for Restaurant week (good start!)  My husband started with the seared Ahi and I had the Gnocchi. Both tasted fabulous and the presentation was lovely! Our main courses (he had lamb, I had salmon) were also terrific. My salmon was perfectly cooked with an interesting chutney like topping and asparagus. Yum. And for desert we had bananas foster and the molten lava chocolate cake! Now THIS was a fabulous menu and so worth the price! Obviously Top of the Rock was showcasing their wares and wanted us to come back! And we will!
4	Ic0qSzPwZ0vCKnHRuGsCw	I live in Colorado and was returning home to Wisconsin for a wedding. So happy to find this amazing little diner off of Highway 151. A hardy old-fashioned breakfast with real food and friendly service
2	6YPLoWDBAM2ggSNwPyJA	The good: 1) A great all you can eat chip bar with some pretty decent hot sauce. 2) A big patio to take a relaxed lunch at. 3) These crazy good green corn tamales with a strange cheese filling that is more like Kanufa then anything I've had at a Mexican restaurant.  The bad: pretty much everything else. The food is around (but below) drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices. They even have the gaul to charge 2.25 for their crappy iced tea you serve yourself.  The worst part of this place is the meat they serve in their dishes which is absolutely horrid except for their machaca. I stick to bean burritos, cheese enchiladas, and the aforementioned green corn tamales if I go.  All of their tortillas and such taste store bought even though I think they make them themselves. And the horchata needs to be avoided at all costs as well.  For counter service Mexican, you gotta go with  La Tolteca if you are downtown. Or Caramba if you are on the west or north side.
2	yDwYNyvOiqWzbWfUYipDuA	After reading some reviews, i decided to check out this place, just a little dissapointed. Theres not enough choices on the menu so i just had couple of nigiri then went to osaka. I think this place is too small of a restaurant to carry different types of fish. They dont even have toro in stock that night.
4	fJENxvxpI92hs6CVArIkWg	I believe I've said this before but I'll say it again.  I'm not a fan of Italian food, but La Famiglia Pizza & Pasta restaurant does a really great job at making me one.   I like calzone's and theirs didn't disappoint.  The mozzarella and ricotta cheese was wonderfully stuffed inside the pizza dough.  The small one is HUGE!  I like the fact that they put the sauce on the side and not inside.  The pizza sauce is not overly spicy for me and has a sweet taste, which in my world makes it really yummy.  Tonight we visited them again and and I tried the stuff shells.  I took a- long my son-in-law, daughter. two grandchildren and my husband. Everyone loved what they ordered.   I tried my husbands baked ziti and I will definitely add that to my list of must tries.    The owners make everyone feel like family and I think this place is worth a visit even if you don't like Italian food.
2	u7PoRqkRi2V9maC1CcREig	I've past this place for years and always wanted to try it. So when a living social deal came up for it I quickly purchased it.   My husband and I went on a Tuesday night. There was only two other couples and one large group in the back. (The large group ended up being what I think were the owner and friends). With only one waitress there you can imagine the lack of service we got. In the end we had to wait 20 Min's for a box for my food and the check.   As for the food, I ordered the house salad, which oddly enough contained raisins,but turned out to be really good. The house salad dressing was also good. My husband however ordered the "famous" minestrone soup. It was sad. Just some broth, a few veggies and a bean or two. Not what we expected. When we finally got garlic bread it was OK, but it was not fresh baked bread by any means. I felt I could buy that loaf at Smith's and call it good. Our main entrees where rather tasty. I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Parmesan. Other then the shrimp being breaded and over cooked, it was yummy. The Chicken was not dry and their noodles and sauce were excellent. My husband devoured his meal. It had their three famous items: stuffed mushrooms, some covered in marinara sauce and others in alfredo sauce, lasagna baked in a pastry dough, and fettuccine alfredo.  He loved all three!    The decor of the place was left to be desired. They had some sad jars of stale pasta and broken neon signs around the restaurant.  Also, the tables had tiles grouted on them and you could totally tell they are not properly cleaned. Bits of food were wedged in the cracks of the table top. The topper was when my husband went to the bathroom and there were door mats underneath the urinals. The mats used to say welcome, but had been peed on so much they were very faded. He said it was extremely gross.   Needless to say we will not be coming back. I feel with some care to the cleanliness, decor and minor menu changes this place could be what it once was.
4	ELczdmdIl0VyA5EvHgRytA	We stopped here on tour one time.  And then one time again on the way back.  Had a nice meal, some beers, some shots, hung out for a bit.  Everyone working there was really friendly.  If I'm ever headed through again I'd definitely stop in.
4	GRc0ishkuZQK0rP4auZFQ	I've never seen a real duck at this Decanter, but I'm pretty sure that if they knew what a great little treat this local business is, they'd be lining up and quaking to be let in.   Duck and Decanter is an adorable little local deli, wine bar and gift shop in Phoenix. With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around.   The food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well.   I always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town.   The wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos. I always forget about the wine bar and need to remember to visit more often.   All in all, Duck and Decanter is a true treat for my taste buds every time I visit. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and place an order to pick up because it can get pretty busy during lunch time. They also deliver!
2	BKL5XTQ43LiN9kzRAwGNqA	I hate the west side. Sorry west siders. That being said, I give every west side place a fair chance. This Subway had workers that were clearly not excited to be there. I understand you work at Subway, and that it's kind of a thankless job sometimes but c'mon.
2	Pp2EQ14DokYLNjAoyvQZLw	I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before, I was taking a chance.  For those that know me, I'm not the gambling kind.    But I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.    Am I glad I checked this place out - sure, but have I been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  If you're in the area and looking for something to do, then check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here.
4	OFS28biHCnhaTvoLYj56ng	Cafe Luna is lovely at lunch time, with tapas at dinner. I haven't been for dinner in a while, but it was great when I went a couple of years ago.  There's patio seating in nice weather, and an intimate dining room otherwise.  Cafe Luna is at the corner of 4th and Green in the funny wooden building - either go up the stairs from Green and turn to your left, or enter from the side entrance on 4th.
2	NmsyZIGQiUOiPSwV0FGfsQ	Stopped in here for lunch one day last week on a shopping trip to REI with the hubby. We both agreed we will not return. The meat was dry and the refried beans were soupy. Nothing tasted very fresh. There's a lot better choices for Mexican in the area.
4	cCfwJotP2ZaGNxe92y0Q	Hands down the best delivery I have had in years. Feeling to lazy to cook I ordered Spinato's last night. I got the super six pizza, thin crust, well done with extra sauce, a small dinner salad and a side order of meatballs.   The pizza was Chicago style and phenomenal! (See pictures) The pizza ingredients were really fresh and the sauce (OH THE SAUCE) tangy and sweet. The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza. Spinato's beats any delivery in my area (Sorry Pat's) and has made the rotation in to my favorite Chicago style pizza. I can't wait to actually try the restaurant, I heard they have great specials and BYOB.
4	ckbkB5IdLkNfcQMg1zAUVA	I know, don't hate.....but I needed to find something inexpensive for dinner and asian sounded good.  My roomie said she liked this place so I thought I would give it a try.  I consider myself a connesour of good food. I love fancy restaurants with beautiful presentation.  But when you're short on funds you make do.  I have to say that I was not expecting much from Pei Wie.  Maybe that's not fair.    I walked in and was greeted warmly.  Since this was my first time the girl explained how to order.  I got the orange peel chicken and brown rice and an order of spring rolls.  I know this is not authentic asian food. But I will say this, it was hot and fresh and it was good.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy on the outside and cruncy on the inside.  The dipping sauce was good too.  My orange peel chicken had a little kick to it.  The veggies were cooked just right and the chicken was moist and tender.  And their ice tea was delish!  It went well with the meal.  Our server was attentive and brought us silverware and cleared everything when we were done.  The place was clean.  Even the area where the drink dispensers are was clean and sometimes that is an area that is just hard to keep clean.    I will go back to this Pei Wie and I will try others.  I think places like this can be hit or miss and that's why they get a bad rap.  But there is a niche for everything and this is one of those niche type places.  I liked it.  So sue me.  I also did not realize that Pei Wie is part of the P.F. Chang's francise.  I like P.F. Chang's too.  There I said it!  So, like Heather C. said......de-Elite me for eating at a place like this that's owed by a francise like that.
4	QJnRVEIqJ4jnpZuHru6X5A	This was my Mother's Denny's.  She loved to go here!  She wasn't much for experimenting with wild exotic food like me.  She always suggested either Floridino's or Denny's, or take out from Boston Market.  We always had good meals here.  One of my fav's was the shrimp skewers, which I got more than once.  I think they were only $5.99 or $6.99 for 10  shrimp and two sides.  It might have been from the senior menu.  Whatever, it was always delicious and just the right amount of food, well cooked and well-flavored.  The service was efficient and friendly also.  Pretty consistent, which was probably what she liked.  No surprises.    I miss going there with her.  (Sniff)
2	iDNs1dcC4mIDWddypVAQ	Bad food, worse service.  Waitress took our drink orders, and then twenty minutes later the manager came by to tell us our waitress got busy with another table and he would take our drink orders. Ten minutes later the original waitress came back to get our drink orders. Ummmm.... hello? Finally got our magaritas, which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour.  And everything was slimy. I'm not OCD or anything but I felt the need to get up and wash my hands after flipping through the menu. And after touching the salt and pepper shakers. And after moving the itty bitty little chip basket from one side of the table to the other.  Ordered an appetizer - the Farmer's Market Quesadilla. Plate was hot but the cheese was cold. Vegetables were slimy. Tortilla was burnt. And they didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. We waited what we thought was an acceptable amount of time for someone to stop by and when nobody did I actually got up, walked across the restaurant to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myself.
4	pAshvj8Ti8FzxvGOonDwxg	When traveling on business, there's very little time in between meetings to get a descent bite to eat unless you're with clients. Charlotte, NC is know for their gerbil tunnels between office complexes. To save time,  each office complex houses the usual fast food chains.  I was told Chick-fil-A was one of the best fast food chains in the southeast.  Being from Nor Cal, my business trip to Charlotte gave me an opportunity to try this out.  I was not disappointed. Connoisseur of this fast food joint told me to order the Chicken sandwich with extra pickles, waffle fries and an Icedream. Great suggestion.   I wish there was one closer to home.
2	7N8XACRnjuIVEX4z0gWLfA	I really don't understand all the 5 star reviews for this place.  The food is decent, but there is no seating, the place seems filthy, they only take cash, and it's in a sketchy part of town.  I will say the food is cheap, but they use frozen patties, and leave their fries under the heat lamp way too long.  I won't be back.
2	ZbuoY36JOfS2RIGEkn4ag	A-ok hole in the wall authentic Mexican seafood place in a not-so-great part of town.   Coworkers and I tried this place out for lunch. One of them was raving about how great it was. And I am always one to try new things especially seafood.   Restaurant itself is spacious and clean. Inside you can buy fresh seafood. We sat down and waitress came to our table. I don't like how she didn't address us in English. Only one of us knew Spanish :-/  They serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice. It was very tasty with the right amount of spice. I ordered a langostino dish - don't remember the exact name. Refer to the pic below. It was served with rice, beans, salad and tortilla. The dish overall was ok. Edible but there was something off about the taste. Maybe I was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so I had some trepidation about my meal. (He had shrimp in a prior visit. He avoided it this time around)  And the tortillas tasted weird. I don't know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but I only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more.   I don't see myself coming back. The price overall was decent (it was paid for LOL, but I wouldn't come back and pay on my own).  I'm not sure if I'd really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience.
2	eoSO85fq9rwHrvnivPun1w	Strange little place hidden on 5th St. in uptown that for some reason stays packed. Of course, it's not really hard to pack this place, as small as it is. It does seem to be popular though, probably mainly due to the scenery of the bartenders.   Unfortunately, you only get a glimpse of them as you grab a drink and try to stay out of the crush. And good luck getting back to your group or your table without spilling half of your drink, if you are lucky enough to find a place to sit.  Live bands and, more often, DJs are in there spinning some decent tunes, but Phil's is more often a staging point for the rest of the evening, a springboard to bigger places and better things.
2	PeXBOZCW2crXwtoSTle5uA	Not really that impressed with this place. I ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle BBQ wings.  The wings were disappointing - the sauce, which I was hoping would at least be interesting, was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much flavor.  They forgot to cut the pizza, which was kind of annoying. I tried a few toppings, half sausage and roasted red peppers, and half ham and olives. The sausage was pretty much just sliced hot dogs, and the rest of the toppings were not noteworthy. The rest of the pizza was equally not noteworthy.  Overall, just overpriced and not that great.
4	d7tfab2KWl8QWtOXGGolQ	This is a very nice family-run Chinese restaurant in downtown Champaign, especially convenient for lunch specials that are well-priced. You will usually be waited on by the proprietress, who is one of the nicest and sweetest people in Champaign-Urbana :) The food is pretty good, although perhaps adjusted for American tastes. It reminds me of the many neighborhood Chinese places all up and down Manhattan. I've had a lot of good lunches there - I can recommend the chicken dishes and the shrimp kung pao. Also good won ton soup.
2	wQgfvaJiHyuRoweyVAvAA	The food and prices are decent but the service could use some work. I felt like this one waitress was very rude. Also, I ordered take out recently, picked it up myself, and payed with a credit card. I found out a couple of days later that they took it upon themselves to add gratuity. It was kind of shady business practice so I won't go back.
4	1QM1t3WLQz2ed5qxMPrpw	Might even be five stars, but it will have to wait until second visit.  I'm not usually big on steak houses.  I like to grill, and like my own preparation is better, and it's really not that hard.  I usually can't see spending a lot of cash on something I like better cooking myself.  Flemings is very good.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and done medium rare.  Many steak places I have tried usually under season their meats, which leaves them bland.   They also try to cook them too quickly.   The reasons for this are really customer service; don't shock the customer, and get them their dinner quickly.    Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor, and slower cooking to keep the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.  The appsy were great.  Salad, Onion soup, and mashed potatoes.    They have some great wine, although I felt they were trying to be a bit manipulative.   The wine list was ranked  gold, silver, bronze, but it was purely on price, not relative to how good they really were.   I had a better cheaper wine, than more expensive.  This is a place where I would bring my own wine, and pay corkage.
2	irA3Pmhtu1HBAqCmaXurg	my friend and i decided to go here since it was close to trader joe's and it had an outside patio area. they were doing some sort of road construction (with a crane, putting up store signs) right beside us throughout our entire meal which was really loud and annoying. this, of course, was not the restaurant's fault but it really affected the ambiance. also, it is right next door to a dog grooming business so there were people and their dogs coming in and out.   we were the only people eating outside since it was pretty hot out (we wanted to smoke) and the fan they had on the patio made it feel pretty comfortable. the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is right in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to look at. i had a quick look at the inside and it seemed small and dark but cozy.   this place is not cheap. we joked that putting the word "cantina" in the restaurant's name allowed them to raise prices (as if it were somehow fancier than your run-of-the-mill mexican place). the chips were decent; the salsa was excellent. the taco salad had WAY to many beans in it and it was overpriced. my friend had the fajitas and it was a tremendous amount of food. there was not enough room for her to really prepare each fajita at the tiny outside table.   my coronas were 4 bucks each and her margaritas (standard size) were each 8 bucks. the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor. the coconut margarita was an interesting flavor but still not worth the price.  the service was ok, nothing great.  the lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again. i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse.  overall, charlotte has better options for mexican food that are cheaper and have better atmospheres.
2	KIEi4zfAxAbzZd86NpWJyA	I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed. If you are thinking about going here know this:  If you grew up in the South Hills, all the people from high school that turned out to be real losers will be hanging out here. (Hey, I've been there, so I am not throwing stones.)  It is otherwise your typical South Pittsburgh yinzer bar. There is always a seat, and there are free pretzels.
2	4ZAG6nXKYYNI39Mb6EXzQ	With all the gazillion Japanese restaurants to choose from here in Vegas, this one isn't the cream of the crop.  I got the bento box with shrimp tempura (2 pieces?!) and rubbery beef teriyaki.  I think the only semi-redeeming thing is the Volcano Roll which was mediocre at best.  I don't think I'll come back anytime in the near future.
2	HQXYAw67BNhiPCCGyhIFyw	Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it.  The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die.  The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets.  Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back.
2	8iQXPjYx1yCkIBlJqNUA	Not very good. Lady behind the counter was really standoffish while I was asking my questions. Best part of the whole meal was the side of sliced avocado. Beans and rice were unflavorful and the beans taste canned. However they gave me a ton of food, so if you like quantity over quality this place might be good for you.
2	w7NpSuMf99ABe4U84bIhA	I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those.
4	Ge5RTkrtdyOODBJkMV4jw	I love this place.  $5.50 for an 8-piece spicy tuna roll.  The cashier was very friendly... and don't tell anyone... she gave me a free miso soup when I told her I had never tried it.  Now don't just walk in the place and announce you've never had miso soup before.  I don't want this place going out of business from all the free-loaders out there.
2	eg09dgUF8ynGV80Sv6Q	Waited forever for my order to be taken, forever to receive it.  Of course. ..it was horrible.  I dont know what part of the chicken I was given, but it was not a wing. Almost $9 for a 3 piece combo that should have been wings. At least everything was hot. That's the only reason I am not giving one star.
4	x5M0SIXpjrU3E1WlCYG1g	Great Thai cuisine prepared by a family staff in nice surroundings. The best Thai in our neighborhood, maybe even in this part of Phoenix. Parking is easy and convenient. Call first if you don't know the schedule as they go back to Thailand now and then for visits.
4	he9vogplwGBieZWcUrnBGw	This is a good pizzeria. It is not great. It doesn't rival any pizzeria back in NY, of where I hail. It is not the Brick Oven pizzeria in Summit, NJ. However, for the most bland, white washed, white bread place on the planet, it is good pizza. Do not order the weird garlic bread crust, just order the original thin crust. As for which pizza to order, there is only one that is truly good. It is the QUATTRO FORMAGGI. Okay, okay, hang on, it is not like any quattro formaggi you would pick up at 1 am in North Caldwell, NJ. But let's be real, we are in Scottsdale, the fact that they put quatto formaggi on the menu without putting in brackets (4 cheese) so the many presbyterian woman would know what it meant is an accomplishment. Moreover, no one in Scottsdale is even out at 1 am. Those presbyterian women have to be in bed by 11, why does anyone need to be up at 1 am?  This is a really good pizza. The combination of flavors is fabulous. It is dead on. There is the sweetness of the pears that mixes with the sharpness of the gorgonzola. It is the correct blend of flavors that mix in your mouth, dance on your taste buds and allow you to say that this pizza is alright.  This is a good place to grab a pizza.
2	fkkVew1rKmrljkng92lGtg	My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.  The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.  The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.  The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.  The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.  So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.
4	K3QKyR7ShhdcOwNOmMri9w	I am not a big fan of the delivery part of Cheba Hut, but going to this location is a great experience.  The subs are to die for delicious, I don't know how else to really describe it, so I will leave it at that.
2	qm6nXALkkty0eupiofcA	Typical food for cracker barrel,. Service is usually pretty good, however today was poor. Several employees standing around talking loudly, all while we waited for 5 min. to be seated in a near empty restaurant. Almost walked out!
4	Y6LTlBtMTIJLi4FdZ56rQ	Stuck in Lodi for the day, I couldn't find a place for lunch, and I dared not to try "The Pizza Pit" in town. I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill.   Visible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.  Once inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.  A big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.  The fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.  While I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.
4	mavsmNhsmUBfcf8OWu3g	Ok, lets start with the obvious. This is not the "nicest" area of the city. But I happen to work pretty close, so it is convenient for lunch.   I must say though I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, and level of service I received here.  The girl who took my order was very sweet, and helpful. Food was typical Showmars fare, everything tasted good. This Showmars also has daily specials & dishes that I have never seen at any other!  I think I even got free hush puppies!! (ordered a side they rang up as $0 on my receipt)  So yea, its a Showmars, and I think we all know what to expect out of them by now, but this was definitely the best one I have ever been to.
2	kYkwsvuv8gxf6wU78gAj1w	About what one would expect from a conglomerate fast food chain as far as the food quality goes, but what was especially remarkable today was the very poor customer service. I sat outside, and when the employee brought my lunch out and did not bring a fork, she acted almost joyous that she got to tell me that I have to go inside to get my own fork. She will have no future in customer service I'm sure of that.  This was at 2:30 on 11/2/13.
2	HfszWeu6EdwwnHuGqWLSkw	I hate being that guy that gives a place with great reviews a not so great review. I see this place has amazing reviews, my wife used to go here years ago on a regular basis and she's told me how amazing the burgers were and so I expected an amazing burger. Boy, was I disappointed.  We started with the cheese curds. They were OK, but nothing spectacular. I ordered Green Chili Bacon Cheeseburger. I honestly think I've had a better burger at In-n-Out and maybe even McDonald's. When the waitress took our order she didn't ask either my wife or myself how we wanted it cooked and both of us forgot to mention it. I don't know if they usually don't ask, but I do sort of expect that when I order a burger. My thinking is if they don't ask, they only serve it one way, and if that is the way I received mine then I don't know how this place gets raves for their burgers. It was well done, completely overcooked, charred on the outside and not juicy at all. In my book, juicy is they key component of a great burger. The patty itself was fairly small and dwarfed by the bun. As my wife said, charge a buck more and add some ground beef. My wife's basic hamburger was the same way - charred, overcooked and dry. The bun was good, though. The fries were also very good but not good enough to make me go back just for the fries. The fries are a side show to the main event of the burger.  As for the service, it started out OK and stayed there. I ordered a Blue Paddle beer. When the server delivered it she asked if I would like an orange to go with it. I said yes but it never showed up. Our water was refilled as needed, which was nice although expected. We did have to wait a while for our check because our server was out on the patio smoking (I know because I watched her). I understand everyone needs a break but IMHO she was out there too long.  I wanted the experience, particularly the food, to be better and according to my wife it used to be fantastic. Either we had a really off night or it's just gone downhill since she's been there. Maybe we'll try it again but as my wife said "There are too many other choices and other places to try out there." I was going to rate this one star, but I'm giving it two simply because everyone else has such amazing things to say. Perhaps it really was just a bad day to stop in. Maybe someday when it's just me I'll swing by, hoping I have a better burger. It couldn't be any worse...
2	j6rF2H1X4fuq2ESBTDNMw	The lady working the drive thru was friendly, however there was only one car in front of me, and it didn't look like they ordered $200 worth of food, but it took over 10 minutes when they pulled up to the window!! Of course my 3 soft tacos were ready and I was able to pay and leave, but the service is SO SLOW!!! And it seems like they close earlier than the times posted on the window some nights.  If you're craving Taco Bell, do yourself a favor and go to the one on Alma School & Warner!! The drive thru window is a little awkwardly set back, but they are quick and the food is always good and correct!!
2	5GedbwOYfeF0rSGTEILWYw	Let's see.....  Apparently, this place is a pretty big deal in the downtown area of Vegas. Mostly within the legal field due to its location by the court house and all the law offices. Was invited to El Sombrero for lunch with some coworkers and figured, well, why not.   Pulling in, I thought maybe, just MAYBE we were cutting through  a parking lot as a shortcut to El Sombrero ......nope. Parking lot is tiny and creepy. This is a door ding, side swipe and car theft area of high risk! Luckily, i wasn't the one driving.   Finally, we make it out of the car and into the restaurant....During lunch hour on a weekday and of course the place is super busy, however, we manage to get seated within minutes. The place was hot (as in humid and no air conditioner) and service was very slow. The server was friendly and helpful in answering our menu questions. The items are all simple mexican dishes but for some reason priced pretty high. I ordered tacos and exactly like some of the other Yelp reviews mentioned, I got hard shell tacos with ground beef?? Seriously?! Someone in my group ordered Enchiladas and they were super runny, almost as if they used pre-made canned sauce that you purchase at Food-4-Less....Was not impressed AT ALL.  I would say this place needs improvements on their menu items, and/or lower prices. The clientele is there, they need to make some changes before Dona  Maria's and Casa Don Juan takes over.
4	k513RHYLoGHzYbFxGZ5uw	I think I've been to Ninja about 10 times. What makes me keep coming back is the freshness of their fish. Why did I give it 4 stars instead of five? Because of a couple of things. The wait staff sometimes appears to forget that you are there. So order all your rolls at once! LOL  The rolls also at times could be tighter. Fall apart at times. They taste great, but I'm not enamored with having to eat my sushi in little pieces. \r \r OK, so that's the bad stuff. The good stuff? Ninja is a very casual sushi joint that I can go to and take my daughter or a casual date.  The sushi is delicious. Their sashimi is fresh, and their rolls, while not groundbreaking, never fail to satisfy. \r \r Another nice, added bonus is the Benihana-like back room. If you're into to that salt and pepper swingin', spatula slappin' stuff. :)  Disclaimer! I have no idea if the back room serves any edible food. Haven't eaten there, but it does seem fairly busy.\r \r So try Ninja, I think you'll like it as a change of pace. Especially on Friday and Saturday where the waits are much shorter than at top tier sushi joints.
4	RD8J3uc3AC4Tv0kihVqxHQ	Just when I was about to give up on good sushi in Charlotte my neighbor introduced me to FUJO or what he calls his secret Chinese restaurant.   Fujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat.   Did I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better.   You never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown.
2	r4GCQpbcV5z59MiD4ogHrw	I was very pleased to receive a response to my review that I'd previously posted. I was very disappointed in the situation that took place however, I do believe that the  Domino's corporates care about their customers. I actually mentioned my experience to a friend of mine and was informed that she too had a similar situation happen when her teenage son ordered from this peticular location. It's a little disheartening to think of how many other people may have been short changed by their delivery driver's. Hopefully this will be adressed and not tolerated.
2	iDrG7i8d4lngFiLAXZj65g	A reasonable place for decent food at a cheap price. Something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though. This place is more of a quick lunch place so it shouldnt really matter how nice the place is or not - but the dreary atmosphere discourages me to go here. The person running the place is somewhat cold and rude, thats something I rather avoid.
4	NpA8oHAXuhQt0bPbTsLMAw	I've eaten inside the restaurant many times and have ordered from them once. I really like getting the Tom Yum Kai, it's got a great blend of tang from the vinegar, heat from chiles and sweetness with the mellow protein note of chicken and chewy mushrooms. It was the first thai food I tried years and years ago and remains a favorite. The curry is good as well, though we always want it to be spicier. It's fun to eat in the restaurant as the soups are served crackling and hot on a clay pot burner. The girl I spoke with while ordering got my address wrong but the driver called to verify and all was corrected. Food is yummy and portions and good. The large size of the soup and the chicken curry was enough to feed 3 hungry people. I'm looking forward to trying out their lunch menus and sampling some of the other items :}
2	aWsqc2yr0xyK1jM0isiEA	This dining experience happened about 5 years ago so its important to keep that in mind when reading this review. As I read the other reviews it looks like nothing has changed. Here is my story: I had some time to kill so I ordered a steak and eggs. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium well. They brought me out a rare, bleeding steak. I asked the waitress if they could fix the issue. The cook, obviously irritated by my request, cooked my steak until it was black, burnt, and tough. I choked down the steak because I was starving. I paid my bill and walked out, never to return again. The place is at a very busy airport so it will always get enough traffic to stay afloat. My advice to any would-be patron is to try and avoid this place at all costs. You are better off getting some fast food or surviving on the peanuts served during your flight.
4	WZXybADgVGAG8FP7wDu7g	We really enjoyed our meal there.  We ordered a variety of dishes including curry beef,  egg foo young and Governor's chicken.  Nothing trendy,  just reliable Chinese dishes.  Everything was fresh,  and the beef egg foo young was especially good.  We'd return.
2	6yHys3sL3y4N7tYZa12ow	First time eating here, the atmosphere is nice, the waitress was friendly but never around, and the service was sooooooo sloowww!!!! and it was not busy. The chips and salsa were good to start, but the beef fajitas were the worst fajitas i have ever had the meat tasted like it was marinated in A-1 sauce, and that's gross on a fajita. Wife's flautas also were not very good, though and my dad had a chicken dinner that he like but said it was too salty, and my mom was not happy with her salad either. (if only twin creeks was open on Mondays)
4	FwIJTEJrCv3spTqZzmrg	The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is that it's often too noisy and crowded inside because of the sports freaks.  The patio is nice when the weather is good, and not noisy.  The wings are excellent here, particularly their two specialty wings which are unusual and very tasty.  The lavosh pizzas are amazing and their specialty dinners and appetizers rival the offerings at high-end restaurants. Decent beer selection on tap.  Prices are reasonable.
2	7yAjoaYPYEWh78RUE2fw	I came across this place not too long ago while suffering through a savage craving for anything Mexican (this happens a lot to me). I was driving around in circles looking for a little dive that might have some authentic and spicy tacos. I just so happened to see a cheap little sign pointing towards this place, and figured what the hell.   First things first... upon walking into this place I noticed it was a little rank; it didn't smell very good, and it was pretty muggy inside. There were two Hispanic gentlemen behind the counter who immediately welcomed me as I quickly studied the menu on the wall. What I first noticed about the menu is that it was all very authentic... very much like if the building was picked up and moved over to Chandler from some small Mexican town. As I was looking, I also noticed some sort of weird mound of meat on a giant metal stick; it was clearly visible in the back room which I'll admit scared me a little bit. I think I may have seen something similar on "Bizarre Foods" once... but I have no idea what the hell it actually was.   Given such a wide array of different choices from the menu, I was immediately puzzled about what I would actually order. This is when one of the guys behind the counter tried to give me some help... he started asking/telling me things in very broken English... like "You like Spicy?" and "Good Pollo!". While he was telling me these things, I got the sense something fishy was going on; because as he was talking to me he was also intermittently laughing hysterically and speaking Spanish with his work buddy. Kind of seemed like one of those "look at this stupid gringo" moments. I was pretty out of my element. To make a long story short... I went with the chicken tacos (except they were called something else, which I didn't understand) and an order of chips with salsa. I took home my steaming back of goodness to pig out... and OH NO... they couldn't have... the horror:   Dark meat chicken... Arrrrrrrrrgghhhhhhhhh!   I take for granted that there are still places that serve dark meat chicken without thinking twice about it or warning you... I also take for granted that there are people out there that actually like dark meat chicken. I can't stand it... to me dark meat chicken tastes like white meat chicken which has gone rotten. I have an immediate gut reaction to it, so needless to say I took one bite of my taco and threw the rest away. I did however eat my chips and salsa like a madman, and they were pretty tasty... so I can't fault them for that.   So this may be a tad unfair... but I feel like a lack of white meat chicken shows that a restaurant is cutting corners and using sub-par ingredients. It'd be like if Jamba Juice used Kool-Aid or Tang to make their smoothies... not cool! If I return I'll try something else non-feathered and I'll leave room for the possibility of an upgraded review... but for now I'm going to brand Taqueria Mi Casita with a shameful 2/5 stars.
4	OX483xhnnRnVs0EsJ5rQ	If you crave a little nostalgia, Brightstar Drive-In is a throwback to a simpler, more neighborly time.   The menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.  What I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's "Fisher Price" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.  Grab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a true throw-back experience out of it.
4	zSSYprv1DqGy7w2hKziLew	Stopped in during a visit to Phoenix based on Yelp reviews.  Green Chili Burro special was fantastic.  Super friendly and great atmosphere.  Not much seating but great for 1 to 4 for a lunch outing or takeout.
4	UikDeBoRNBRFndXqD7jnA	I'm going for a 4, but I really feel this is more of a 3.5.....better to over-state than under in fairness.  My first visit was a to-go order. The phone call seemed to go almost too smoothly. That should have been my first clue. One order had chopped sausage inside the omelette, instead of links ON THE SIDE. The second order had shell pieces in the fried egg. The third order was for fresh fruit (I asked specifically if there were berries) and instead was fresh melon and orange wedges! I will say the muffins were amazing as always and totally worth going off my gluten-free restriction for!  Second visit was because the manager was quick to want to resolve the first debacle - nice job, Fernando! Very professional in his approach and made it easy for me, at my convenience, to come by for a do-over :) HOWEVER, although the food was exactly as we ordered for this breakfast, we got to hear the waitress calling out that her customers said their food was to be comped.....calling out across the whole dining room! WTH?! Not so professional on that level :(  All said, my impression is that the manager knows he has a kitchen and wait staff that might be rough around the edges and also understands customer loyalty is critical to a good business model.  I'll return for lunch and see if we can't make this a solid 4 stars or even 5 :)
4	6k9saNsoxbCJ03SLhsiXQ	This is the closest Subway to home, and is conveniently located in an easily accessible strip mall. The store is always very clean and organized, and the people working are friendly and helpful. My only issue with this location is that it is very slow sometimes and gets crowded if there is a rush. Otherwise, it's a solid location
2	1UKKhnjNvJ2Xf24xYDviA	After hearing how great Jimmy John's is, I decided to go in myself and see what all the fuss was about. To be honest the sandwich wasn't good. I gave them 2 stars for having good customer service and for being so quick.
4	IgtAFe1jL6E6aehTAahA	I first found out about this place when my neighbor mentioned he was one of the cooks and so graciously surprised us one day with a couple platters of enchiladas and a giant bag of chips and salsa.   We loved it so much we decided to go to the restaurant and eat.   Just for the record,I'll have you know some of the best Mexican Food Restaurants I've eaten in have had no windows and Rositas is no exception.   Service was prompt and friendly. Chips were hot and crisp. Salsa was good too but not as good as the kind we were given by our neighbor...must have been his special recipe ;-)   I ordered the 2 item Lunch combo for $7.95 and chose a chicken taco and a tostada (see pics)  This is something I typically order everywhere I go and it's usually swimming in grease, but not here! Not even a drop!!  Everything was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!!   My husband ordered their Stacked Enchilada Platter with fried eggs on top (see pics)  Unbelievably good! Again Hot and Fresh and Truly the absolute BEST Enchilada Sauce either one of us has ever had!  This is now the go to place for Enchiladas!  I even had to ask for a side of the sauce for my dish I liked it so much.   I will definitely be back to try more from the expansive menu. They even sell items in bulk to go, great for when you aren't in the mood to make dinner, Rositas to the Rescue!   They are open at 9am for Breakfast too and serve hot cinnamon crisps instead of chips and salsa, now if that's not a reason to go I don't know what is!
2	pLg7ixh3aKMt426Y98f6Vw	The restaurant was empty when we went.  It was kind of cool, felt like I reserved the whole restaurant for me and my lady.    I am giving this place 2 stars because the food was OK.  But the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat.
4	zCkxkGNOUzIVwBeYzh3A	We came here after a living social deal.  We wanted to come here anyways as we live close and it is one of the last places in the shopping center we need to try.  We were immediately seated.  Took a few minutes to get someone to us for a drink order, but after that service was fast.  We both ordered egg rolls and two entrees (sesame chicken and some other pork meal).  The rolls were okay, but they had shrimp in them, I'm not a fan of shrimp, wish I had known!!  Aside from that, the entrees were HUGE!  We both had leftovers, and a huge plus that it was still good for two more nights!  Such great flavored food!  We will be back for more!  My only other complaint is they added gratuity for the two of us, not sure if it was because of the living social deal or if that is normal, but we like to tip what we want.  Unfortunately our server got less than what we would haven given.
4	B8iS1Mom2XfvyfaCgPqw	This rating is on a scale of fast food restaurants and on that scale, Rubio's is pretty much top notch.  The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty, especially the verde salsa...yummy.  There are not too many "healthy" options that are that tasty, but it definitely beats the fattiness of Baja Fresh any day.  If we are in a hurry and in an area with Rubio's, it is my pick.  It would be so much better if Texas was invaded by Rubio's instead of Taco Del Mar.
2	JRItXdvNY9NGpKntLGsA	I was so excited when I saw the menu for this place.  W walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too.   We started with the onion rings. Fried onions how can this be screwed up? They found a way the bater was flavorless and the onions were just a bit to raw and hard. ($6)  We had our included salads and hey were good, just lettuce dressing crutons and the obligatory garnish of cucumber and carrot.  I had the MACADAMIA MAHI MAHI $11.99,the price was great, but the execution was anything but, it tasted just like the frozen stuff I can get from the store, the crust was soggy and the fish was over cooked and it did not taste fresh, this is nothing like Roy's version.  A family member go the pineapple "shashimi grade" ahi $11.99 This came over cooked despite asking for it seared and and too much of the white sinuous Grissel in it for a "quality" ahi.  I really want this place to be good, but it just was not.
2	GJGkTFaZE60WFv52AwUw	The minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation.  But only on weeknights.  When there are no sporting events.  And your car has run out of gas and can't get you out of campustown.  And you really need a drink because your advisor just called you to tell you you have to cancel your weekend plans to come over and shovel his sidewalk.    The leftover vomit is less tangible, the smoky haze less all-engulfing, and the number of 14 year olds skanks less overwhelming than anywhere else on campus (except firehaus, but apparently no one goes to firehaus despite the fact that it is clean, devoid of skanks, and conveniently located.)
2	Nb6g3K5pO94IM6DO7rwJGA	I went to this restaurant for my mother in Laws Birthday. We waited to get a table for about 45 minutes. The service was quick but.. the food tasted like it had sit out too long. I ordered the salad and bread sticks,and a chicken fettachini alfredo and I was not happy with the quality of the food especially the noodles, I think the fettachinii alfredo in the box turns out better then what I recieve and to top it off my husband threw up in he parking lot. It was way over priced for the quality, and the only reason I gave it a two is because the waiter was soo friendly. meh I am a sucker for customer service even if the quality of the food is gross.
2	rAg5QEyv6zFjgNcD9O650Q	Had the spicy chicken rigatoni, and it was delicious.  The sauce to pasta ratio was too high, so if we lived in the area, we'd have taken the leftovers and could have eaten two more meals by adding some extra pasta.  The service was terrible.  We ate here the night before running the Pittsburgh half marathon.  The place was busy, but there were a few empty tables around us.  Our waitress took at least 20 minutes to do everything.  Twenty minutes before our order was taken, 20 more minutes before we got our drinks.  Half an hour to bring us dessert, and yet another 20 minutes to get our check, and almost half an hour to take our credit card.  We were at the table for over 2.5 hours.  She was almost never in the room, so we're not sure what she was doing, but it was some of the worst service we've had in quite some time.
2	tfPjJMZo1cGUiu4Fkzqdsg	A nice sirloin steak (NY cut according to the waiter) would not be so thick and not be chewy either.  Dry aged steak?  They just aren't supposed to be chewy.  The side dishes were mediocre.  The bread on the other hand was nice because of the large selection they offer.  The raisin wheat bread was the best.    It didn't help that it was late and we were very hungry.    Again, steak is not supposed to be chewy.  One would expect much more for the price.
4	LDDnszBlXHnq7Sr1ggQHg	I'm not a big wing fan. That is, I love wings, I loathe the work it takes to get a bite of meat off that tiny bone. I do like to eat with my hands, though, and I enjoy getting messy while doing it. Not to say I eat like an absolute slob, but I don't mind a little trip to the handsink after devouring a handmeal.  What? Anyway ... the saving grace, the reason that I'd make a trip to Buffalo Wild Wings given the fact that I don't enjoy eating standard wings is because they have *drum roll* BONELESS WINGS! Okay, okay, they're chicken strips. Whatever. They've got 'em, and they offer 'em in all the tasty sauces they serve the regular wings in. Parmesan Garlic boneless wings and a beer? That's fancy cookin' right there. Have me a big ol' time.   Like my Granddaddy would say, "They's fit t'eat."  But, I agree with Crystal, as for the atmosphere and service? I don't much care for sports-type bars, and I like to be, you know, waited on.
2	nMyVvJcnV0Ps04Ud3TZcCA	This was not the same place I remembered as a teen in California. Menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway. On a good note the bread was fresh, but sadly I won't hit it up again.
4	TmmVWFE48XBabVi9yp7Q	Yummy! Love the salsa and homemade tortillas! So far haven't had anything bad! Love the Cozumel burrito! But be warned, it's HUGE and is served with sides of refried beans with cheese on top, and  mexican rice.   I recommend the chicken soup, served with fresh avacado on top and a lime on the side to squeeze into it just before you eat it. It's to die for!  This place tends to be packed on Friday nites, but go during the week and it's great.  Casual atmosphere, has outside seating when it's not broiling hot outside, and altho they do have a bar, it tends to lean towards a family dining kinda place.
4	dpcNcCGKJ9IFmh6k4RxA	This location review based off of experience on Thursday morning. Walked in and the store was clean and empty. I was actually only customer there. I was greeted promptly for my order. Within 5 min order was complete.  I ordered the cheese and egg omelet. Tasty pretty tasting but shocked at sticker price for sandwich.  Cost $7.50 for foot long and drink.  Side note subway change the pee color branding (like booth seats) with something more updated. Just look yucky and dirty even when clean.
2	RRnLKZlwxr4qXoHfUMS0kg	GROSS!   It was like every roll that we ordered was drenched in a teriyaki sauce. The sushi was craptastic and the price sure as hell didn't reflect it. The service was okay, I was surprised at how fast they got the sushi out to us..
2	qrvNzLlA1QVyZoeVDJWbEQ	Why is this place still open? Staff are unfriendly at best, and rude generally. Asking for simple things like a bread plate for the bread knots is apparently an inconvenience.   The tv is blaring some obnoxious news station and she blatantly ignored multiple requests to change the station. My daughter first asked and she rudely just said no.   The pizza slice my daughter got was so greasy, that it dripped off in this reddish-orange greasy liquid. She refused to eat it.   I ordered eggplant pasta, which was okay, but nothing special, especially for $11 a plate.  It's a dive. If you like that sort of place, then you might like it here. But, just be aware that they don't charge "dive" prices.
4	m1JGhA2LbCkbMcrwmG75A	The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good. This place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly.
2	NmwAI4cM81Rbu4UC3fhuQ	I'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds. In fact I hate it. I quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. LAME.  I wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.  I give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time.   Remember, beggars can't be chooser. So when it comes to McDonalds, panhandle elsewhere.
4	o6Jzvumkb839YBhKzzGrpg	First visit today.  My husband had the burger and I had the grilled chicken philly cheese steak.  Both were yummy.  Waitress was very personable and the atmosphere was casual small-town.  We will be back!
4	8UqesMm26FiONckyox0m9Q	I only ever order one thing at Chili's and if I can't have it, then I am not happy.  I was in the mood for my favorite Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers so the husband and I stopped by after a little bit of b-day shopping for my mom.  This location is weird.  There were a couple weeks a couple months ago where I swear this place wasn't open.  No lights, no misters, no cars, nothing.  It was really strange.  It was definitely open this time.    We were immediately greeted by a middle aged guy, who I felt sorry for but what can you do in this economy, and were seated in the upstairs portion at a ridiculously long table/bench area with enough seating for 8.  That type of seating arrangement is really awkward when there is only two people dining.  Our waitress was good, serving us our drinks really quickly and refilling them without asking.  The food was fantastic, in terms of sauced up chicken fingers.  I love the sweet/smoky/spicy flavor of the sauce, the chicken is always juicy and the fries and corn area always tasty.  I can't really complain about anything.  I take that back, I can complain about the booth directly across from me.  There were two adults and a two year old.  The two adults were very clearly deaf.  They were using sign language and I was not so discreetly staring at them intently, fascinated by the sign language.  However, their child started screaming at the top of his lungs at one point.  I don't know how they missed the vibrations in the air right next to them, but they didn't do anything to shush him.  Oh well, I'm not at some fine-dining establishment, so I guess you have to expect it.  This is a good Chili's.
4	lQlKieJeh9iTLPtjIpnbw	This is one of my favorite lunch destinations. The food is just as good (and frequently better) than any other fast food place and the service is always great. A couple of the ladies behind the counter even remember our names.
4	jU61WJD71MpMXMkelB261A	If you are ever over here at lunchtime, be sure to stop in. I am very enthusiastic about this place! I used to drive over here once or twice a week for the lunch buffet. Dinner and  weekends you order off the menu, but it is the same good food. Great Jamaican, Great buffet!  My favorite dish is the jumbalaya, though it isn't always at the buffet. Mango chicken and jerk pork are also great. There is always a good abundance of fried plantains. I highly recommend taking a lunch break to come out here--but be prepared to take a lot of lunch breaks over here after you try it.
4	5XCgs4JbHa7Er4fQTEMLMA	I'm usually in Pittsburgh once a year and each time I come to town I typically have Vincents. Their NY Style thin crust pizza is just awesome and the service is typically pretty good. Regular crust is good as well if you want  something a little bit thicker.
2	OejsbjmgnXWNHRMYiU10Q	I was disappointed in my experience at Fado Irish Pub.  My friends have really enjoyed Fado for lunch in the past and so I thought I would give it a try for St. Paddy's.  Probably a mistake going to a very busy Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day but I thought it would be fun to check out the live music under the tent and reasonably priced Killian's Irish Red.  It wasn't the immense crowd that make me unhappy, but the fact that on a day when Fado knows they are going to be turning a huge profit, they still charged a $15 cover charge just to get in and wait in line for 20 minutes for a cup of beer.  In principle I usually refuse to pay a cover charge but my friends and I had already made plans to meet another friend there and so we felt obligated to stay.  Plus, the doorman said that I would be receiving a $10 gift card for entering, really only making my cover charge $5.  Too bad he didn't mention that you had to spend $20 on items other than alcohol in order to get the $10 discount.  That's not called a gift certificate, that is a coupon.  By the time my other friend arrived only 30 minutes after I did, the line was so long (around the block!) that she would have to wait at least an hour to enter, so all of us ended up leaving and going to another restaurant/bar.  $15 per head cover when you already know you are going to turn a huge profit is just greedy.  On a positive note, there was no line for the ladies room inside of the bar due to the crowd control at the door. Perhaps contributing to my negative attitude is the fact that I am possibly just getting too old for this kind of experience, with the meat-market atmosphere and drunk idiots everywhere.  If you are young and looking to hook up, this might be just the place!  Next St. Patrick's I will probably go somewhere more low-key where there is no cover charge.
2	HonWX0vMbBGuH51sEXA	This place is decent however lacks cleanliness which is concern for me when I want to dine in. Food is good I had their teriyaki rice bowl and their ultimate meat bowl which was also pretty good.  I think Yogis on Camelback j's the best rice bowl place in the valley though.
2	JfZbr5Y4wSiReo2pRagItw	Food was typical Chili's which is what you expect when you go there, but terrible service, sat at the bar and the bartender was never behind the bar the entire time we had lunch. Never refilled out tea and had to ask for a beer. Then had to flag someone for our check. Restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well. Choose someplace different, Chili's just isn't the same for a quick bite and a beer.
4	cIzFt5mXGQ4MYj3qrHPjQ	I think Laredo's has the best Mexican food in Madison. I really like their salsa and guacamole. They have great cheese enchiladas too. Their margaritas are really tasty too:-) I recommend going to eat here.
2	vIzpEVo9h8EQgoddsyS3sQ	Extremely disappointed in this place... I brought my sister and a friend who were both in town from New York. Our waiter was full of inappropriate comments, starting with calling our male friend "Hugh" and asking if he was looking for a third girl now that Kendra had left. He later told my sister she looked like Caroline Kennedy, which is NOT a compliment. (Smart woman, very nice, but definitely not a looker. Kennedy, not my sister.) I appreciate friendly, cheerful service, but not ill-thought conversation.  We started our meals with salads. The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.  My entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.  My sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.  Our friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.  I finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).  We finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.  I know this place has been open since the '80s, but I'm not sure how. We won't be returning again.
2	wS2BD3pwmwj2dNTZ0Ruzw	ITs no longer Chanpen. Now its Bangkok BBQ but for some reason it won't let me add it as Bangkok- Meh. That sums it up. Son ordered the yellow curry, which had previously been a big hit at Chanpen. It was only lukewarm, much thinner than Chanpen's version and had big globs of fat floating around on the top hinting at the fact that it had been sitting for a while and had lost its emulsification. I had the thai bbq chicken. Maybe it would have been better if it was even somewhat warm, let alone hot. The man had the bbq spare ribs. Again, not even warm. The eggrolls were pretty tasteless too. There are better thai places in town. Chanpen was one of them. I wouldn't waste my time here.
2	az3Hq20cTVwPHOX1uNAa9w	Wendy's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years.  They kept the soda machine behind the counter, and their slow counter service discourages people for waiting for refills.    And they save money that way.  Well, many Wendy's have been outfitted with modern soda machines in the lobby.  This Wendy's has been refreshed, but for NOT have the new soda machines.  So if you are thirsty and there is a line at the ordering counter, prepare to wait forever or to give up and leave.   Any Wendy's where i have to wait behind old blue hairs counting out exact change to pay for their senior coffees gets a low rating.  It's fast food... I want things fast!  Interior is nice otherwise.  Chili is under filled....
2	GyjFv0sHjGdTSY0BalmYmw	I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!
2	ZZzsZsafbddzzptfRQWA	I have had good experiences with the staff here however the area is terrible.  This is a  hot spot for the panhandlers in the area.  I can think of at least a couple of times when their begging made my guests feel uncomfortable.  I am not saying this is a bad venue just that you should be aware of this issue when choosing a spot for seeing friends or a date.
2	QVfOXkRMOyum4YHcg9pg	Poor customer service. Excellent bagels.  A restaurant shouldn't solely be reviewed on the food they serve alone. That is why I gave Hot Bagels on 59th Ave 2 stars. Although the bagels are amazing, the customer service is very poor. Next time I will send in someone else to purchase a bagel for me.
4	gKSFKpHvC9TGHWUWKPvEw	Yum!  We just moved to the area and were looking for a new Chinese take out - and we found a great one.  Their General Tso's chicken is delicious, yummy egg rolls and the dumplings were really tasty.  We'll be going back again.
2	UsK1DuNgxD2mAnLghbvBMA	Bad service and unfriendly staff. Everyone looks like working there has made them bitter, fat and angry. The food is not good; NEVER ORDER THE FRIES! The crowd there  is so-so at best, usually on the trashy side. Guard your wallet or purse. Heavy smoking crowd as well.
2	oxeQP7gp4A2gukKCFbLYw	I remember Arby's quality being better about 10 years ago. The sandwiches were filled with roast beef and the prices were great. Now they barely put roast beef in the bread and the prices have gone up too much. I used to enjoy it a lot, but times have changed
4	jV6mwcKq3cWzOLmPyEEu7w	Fitness Cafe is a unique place with great food. As the name indicates, this establishment caters to the health concious. The menu is posted on a giant sign over the cash register and each item includes # of calories, grams of protein, and # of carbs. Fitness Cafe serves breakfast, but I always go for lunch. They offer a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, pasta plates, and delicious smoothies. My favorite is the Olympian Pita with chicken.  As previously stated, Fitness Cafe is a great place to people watch. Also the walls are adorned with autographed photos of well-known bodybuilders including locals.   FC is not open for dinner. I think they close at 4 or 5 pm.  Very fun place with healthy, delicious food. Say hi to Anthony. He'll know your name after 2 or 3 visits.
4	6xyh4OivKT1UfVRtTN0COw	Boston Market... yum.  If you're in the mood for some home-style foods or in a hurry and want some comfort food, this is the place to go!  I especially like this location because they have the same menu with healthy options AND they'll make you up a fresh batch of something if they're running low or it's late and they ran out.  My roomie and I sometimes stopped here after our Lifetime Fitness nights. :)  See ya there!
4	ASMlrJ4GzL4dwSTx7F5PJg	This is a biker friendly bar. Ice cold beer with a good selection. Excellent burgers. During the summer they have live music on Friday nights. Once it cools down outside though they have live music on Fri-Sat starting in the afternoons.
4	M7NQLAvZ0EZ8SJzFsv2Iw	I actually really enjoy this place, and I'm kind of a brat about Indian food. The food isn't the best ever, by any means, but it's always been pretty damn good. The service has always been attentive, friendly and lighthearted- they always make sure that we have a good time. I've never been to their buffet (buffets make me nervous at restaurants where that's not ALL that they do) so I can't comment on the quality there, but my dinners have always seemed fresh and high quality. The ambience is nice and I, personally, found the lighting to be at a nice dim level. The price is good too.  A great place to take first timers who are afraid of Indian food.
4	kbZYx4fZIsInRvytbOXxbA	This Sonny's location has been recently refurbished, which looks better than it did before; though it is one of the smaller locations for this chain restaurant.  I do visit this Sonny's more often because of its proximity to I-77 (when driving by) and/or it's location in front of Costco, when I shop there; so I guess I'm somewhat of a regular.  On my last visit, I ordered the Pork 3-Way plate with fries, coleslaw, and sweet tea.  The order went fast, with food already on table within' five minutes.  The coleslaw was as expected: sweet, slightly creamy with a good crunch to it.  The fries were okay I guess, though a few were soft.  The pulled pork was very good, I drizzled it with sizzilin' sweet sauce on top and ate it with the garlic bread.  The sliced pork (which I asked to be chopped) was good too.  The ribs (dry rubbed) were probably the weakest on the plate, the underneath part of the rib was nothing but fat and was easy to scrap off by a knife; were kind of dry but not bad.  Overall, it was a good meal.  The waitress came by the table often to refill my drink without asking; overall good service.  Now is this the best barbeque around, no... but it's not bad either.  Sonny's is one of the better barbeque chain restaurants in the southeast and this location is one of its better locations, and that is how I am rating it.
2	D7BNBZ1zS4CY4jfgE40g	I'd come here with a group of acquaintances from a convention across the street.  The majority of them had chosen Gardunos because they don't have many Mexican restaurants where they come from.    The restaurant is a typical Mexican establishment, although I question its authenticity as a Mexican establishment when they list two versions of Fettuccini Alfredo in their chef's specials.    My acquaintances ordered the tableside guacamole, which I've always found to be a rip-off in any restaurant, especially because it's not like a teppan show when they're mixing the ingredients up.  Sure enough, the guacamole mixer was rather uninspired, as were the ingredients she brought with her.  I had the Stuffed Sopaipillas, mainly because I love sopaipillas.  You include sopaipillas in your menu, I will try them.  And they were... OK.  In the end, it might as well have been a burrito I'd had.  My friends may have thought they were someplace serving pretty good Mexican food.  Considering they made some banal choices (cheese enchiladas, chicken burrito, etc.), there was nothing to complain about save for the service from an over-worked waitress.    In the end, I'd had comparable food at some of the fast-food Mexican places in my area.  Better than Taco Bell, but not worth the effort for a sit-down place.
2	DSf2GbjzKXe5L1ew3BYLQg	You get what you pay for and for what I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a burger joint. I liked the fries and the small drinks were HUGE.... but isn't that everywhere now a days. A+ for fast and friendly service. Prolly won't visit again--I'd rather go up the street to Micky D's for a Big Mac.
4	J6qJPLAepBd45o501oGNg	One day I was making some chicken, and when it was done, I looked at it and said to my wife, "Damn - we can't eat that. That's disgusting."  So she threw it away and I drove to KFC, because we already had buns with mayo and lettuce, we just needed the chicken. They've got this new menu, and one of the things on it is called "Tenders and Wedges for Two" which is awesome, because that is exactly what I want. Now I haven't been to a KFC in like, 8 years. So how did I know the menu was new? Because when I ordered it, the guy at the counter had no idea what I was talking about. I mean he was cool about it - he wasn't an idiot - I was just apparently the first person ever to order that. So he called up two other guys and they all tried to find the item on the register so I could order it, and eventually the first guy found it, and everybody went back to chicken making.  And the chicken was pretty dagone good.  I totally recommend you make your own sandwiches, but then toss in a couple of chicken tenders. Delicious 'tendies' as some call them. And the potato wedges were great too.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  So why not try it out? Chicken?!
4	3S2Zhm9aITDGkgxnoOZPw	This is the place to be late-night...  You can get some good pizza, watch the drunken antics around you and possibly be the star attraction if you ARE that drunk person.  They cook your pizza pretty quickly and it has always been good.  Tip:  call ahead as you are walking over and your pizza will be done that much more quickly!  p.s.  this place is 3 stars for food, but gets upgraded to 4 stars for the stories I have to tell because of the antics witnessed here!
4	HkCiqjWFuZsD4SIr02WjbQ	I usually just order there food for lunch. I LOVE their white pizza with garlic shrimp and the white garlic chicken. I order their wings suicide hot, and while they are not "suicide" by the mere definition, they are very delicious. They put fresh jalapenos in there as an added bonus. Me likey. I also really, really like their turkey sandwich and their philly cheese steak is the bomb! I am eating their antipasto salad right at this very moment and am very pleased. YUM! Their delivery is super quick and the drivers are ALWAYS SUPER NICE! I have ordered from quite a few different locations around the valley and they have all been very consistent and down right tasty! Kudos Street of New York! I am a fan. Oh yeah, I also like the fact that they are a local company and do a lot of sponsorships for local kids teams... that is always super refreshing to see!
4	Y2V8vCFi63ena06w0vENw	Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea, five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!  From there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped, still good!  I'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress, I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!  Persian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio, Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!  Baklava a bit disappointing, papery filo, though drier than the overly syrupy version
2	ldmbpmdROFyoMTcukbiKA	I should have known better to go to Uno anywhere other than Chicago, but it was late and I was hungry.  Service was fine....I don't know what to say...expensive, restaurant should have been MUCH cleaner considering there was only about 10 people there.
2	9qpevK4OI3P9LFeneqgWg	Food was overpriced for its quality. When you proclaim that you are a premier BBQ restaurant you should deliver.   The brisket was fatty and disappointing. 6 small strips for $18 and the flavor of liquid smoke is all I could taste.   Very disappointing.
2	b6HV60h4KucPRITTt54uw	Let's just say, even though this location is literally 5 minutes away, which is perfect for my Saturday morning hangovers, I will definitely be heading to a different one in the future.   Bojangles's, I love you. I do. But here, you've failed me.   This location was definitely the worst one I've ever visited. To start, the building and interior was a little old, outdated, and dirty. But since it's Bojangles' I'm not really weighing too much on that.   What made this location the worst was the service. To start, the cashier was not paying attention at all and repeatedly misheard our party's orders. Even though it seemed like we finally straightened it out at the register, two of our items came out to us incorrect.   The most surprising/disappointing aspect was the manager's behavior. I fully understand that the fast food business is, well, fast. But the way he talked to customers was borderline unprofessional, but at the very least unpleasant. I was taken aback when an older gentlemen was struggling to explain the menu item he was asking for and the manager clearly was rushing him in a rude manner.
4	3GloRH2ZV1pQcU1hXYGQTg	All the debate on Chinese food in the valley gets tiring. Sure we may not have the options some bigger more culturally astute metropolis' offer, but we have a plethora of little spots like this, sequestered away in the seas of stripmalls that dominate the vast swathes of phoenix's urban sprawl.  I came here on Xmas day with my brother, sister, mother and sister-in-law and I would say we were all pleasantly surprised. Little Peking is your standard American style Chinese fare, you'll see all the usual suspects; almond chicken, kung pao, lo mein, moo goo gai pan, sweet and sour, twice cooked, well you get the picture. Despite the lack of "authenticity" (and I say that in quotes because who the hell am I, a white dude, to question whether or not a dish made by some one of Chinese descent is authentic) everything we ordered was darn good. Not overly greasy, the fried items being lightly breaded with only white meat used; I genuinely liked Little Peking's version of twice cooked chicken more than the Chinese delivery place I regularly order from in my hood. Whats more is that their lunch menu was insanely cheap, we paid about $20 for a party of four.  Little Peking is a solid option for those in the area, give them a shot.
4	6CzpOaq9XWputFJ0UDKxA	Great sandwich shop.  Get the Bobbi.  They actually roast entire turkey's overnight and carve it for the sandwich.  Add the sweet cranberry sauce with stuffing and it's an amazing turkey sandwich.  It's Thanksgiving in a sandwich everyday.
2	TBLmJhqWQkZlQ5VUT892sw	After all I heard, I was disappointed in this place. The breakfast was OK. Yes, the potatoes are exceptional and the quick breads a nice touch.   We sat in a banquette & I noticed dirt & dust in the corner. If I see this in the front of the house, I can't help but wonder what the kitchen looks like! My husband's omlette tasted vaguely of shrimp, which made us wonder if the pan had been cleaned.  I'm sure there are better breakfasts in LV.  I
2	gR0bW8RkcQ3vTEayXMzf5A	I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.  Chuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite!
4	1GsbRmN274SFSxxqk8Nl4g	What can I say, its a Waffle House. I have spent a lot of time in these establishments while living in the south and this one in the west is the same.  If you want a good down home meal, this is a great place. No ambiance, but that is not why you go to a Waffle House.
2	Otrbl3rCidqGjWzOn48yA	I have heard how great this place was, so thought I would give it a try.  I have to say that the Green Chile Cheese Crisp is amazing, so simple and add some of their great salsa it is a winner.  However that being said, the place was a mess!  We were ignored the first 15 minutes we were there.  The restaurant is DIRTY. the tables the floors the walls just gross dirty.  The health department should shut them down just for that, can't imagine the kitchen!  If you were a fan of the tv show Will and Grace, you will be happy to know that Rosario has found work here, and she is just full of mean, no funny!  The food was bland, there was no seasoning at all that I could tell and it was all so mashed together on my plate I wasn't even sure what I was eating.  Brave it Once for the Green Chile Cheese Crisp then find a place that has some flavor, and that is clean!
4	Yjxm4HxpYTtlLhY4I38j7w	Above average Italian food.  There is nothing exciting about this place, but it has a very comfortable atmosphere and good food.  I usually get Chicken Parmesan or their meat lasagna.  They do serve complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It's a nice place, but I just haven't found a favorite Italian restaurant yet.  If you have a great place, please share it with me.
4	m3ZvLDGtqmJ0kH0tfZTw	I need to indulge myself on the rest of this establishment but review is limited to the bread they sell on the street.  On a crowded street you will find a very funny bread-salesmen gunning for your attention to be focused on the racks of bread loafs behind him.  Well sir, you are in fact an excellent and carney-esque salesman but you need not do much.  The aroma emanating from the bread itself on a busy street is enough.  Goodness is the smell of freshly baked bread amazing.  And this place has a few standard options and some excellent "different" options.  The cheesey jalapeno bread was incredibly delicious.  However, my favorite selection of the day was the freshly dressed (I want to say with some fresh tomato sauce and basil) toasted  bread.  WOW!
2	MRBnNK5WmlOIroQyQsbxXg	I ate at Somburros for dinner around 8:30 or 9:00pm.  The place was not too busy.  It was clean and brightly lit.  I was greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter who too my order.  I had the #1 combo a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.  With a medium soda the check came to just under $9.  A small tray of tasty chips was included.  Not cheap.    Mexican food in Tempe has to be great just to stay in business.  There is so much competition.  So my two stars would probably be three in another town, like French Lick Indiana.  It's a real town without many Mexican food places.     The taco was just ok.  A little on the small side.  The corn tortilla was fried in old oil which gave it a burnt stale taste.  The chicken was tasty, and the lettuce was crisp.  There was a little cheese in there too.  It tasted cheesy.   The enchilada  sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown.  I'm not an enchilada expert but I've had better.  This cheese enchilada was flat and I could not taste any onions.   The rice and beans were average.    On the bright side the food was hot.    I didn't find Someburros to be a very good value.  I have had much better tacos and  enchiladas at full service restaurants for less money.   I'm going to keep looking for some great tacos.
4	06tnJSvRqMMNlDWDHh11Uw	Three Sisters is one of the best breakfast joints in the Madison area. For me the two best things are the hash browns and the omelettes. Like all the other raters, I think their hash browns are perfect. Their omelettes are not the fluffy kind. They are flat-cooked, sheet-style, folded around all the good stuff you specify. This is the kind of omelette I prefer, and for this style theirs is one of the best I've had. Beyond that, the service is super unpretentious and friendly. Their cinnamon rolls are big, soft, and without the density I favor. Their pancakes are more spongy than I like. But you should still try them, it's just a matter of style, and everything here is done with sincerity and consistency. You will find something you like enough to keep going back, especially since their prices are so reasonable.
4	PqkgQTAOdYdzoxOLB6Qejg	Large take out pepperoni pizza filled a delicious hole on a really cold night! It was ready in 15 minutes and was exactly what I was looking for in a take out pizza. Chewy crust, zippy sauce, greasy cheese, and tasty meat. Will be back!
2	MoEHg4A92sLfw3WO05kFw	We used to go to Sir Edmund's often. Then a couple of years ago, they closed for renovation, so it wasn't on our radar until last night. We were glad it still has that great pub atmosphere and that the menu still had our favorites. However, the items that used to be great we're just OK last night. The goat cheese fritters were very bland. I actually had to add salt to them. Without good seasoning, they lost their "wow" factor. The kids' grilled cheese was dry and bland and the fries soft.  The service, although friendly. was very slow last night. Two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room.  We waited 20 minutes before anyone took our food order.  They have 2 menus: entrees and bar food which includes appetizers. The choices are good but too pricey to choose 2 appetizers  as your meal along with a salad. We may go again if we are in the area, but it will be for the beer and atmosphere, not for good food.
2	2V1ABy64I9feQWoNWvp7A	If you're Asian and love chinese food you will be disappointed by this place.   If you have a bland taste for Chinese food then you'll like it. Its a little pricey, but you have to think location. I will say that its better then PF Chang and their service is a lot better. This won't be a place that I go to if I was craving for Chinese food.
2	Ms9bTOPoCtAvqUEAwYw	Here is the deal - I love El Pollo Loco in general.  We eat their chicken often, but this place is consistently slow, slower than the other locations - and it was really bad tonight.  So bad, I had to write about it.  I waited in the middle of the drive through line (where I was stuck, or I would have left) for 20 minutes because they ran out of chicken.  I was getting fairly frustrated and was considering never coming to this location again EXCEPT the drive through guy was so nice and apologetic.    I didn't take it out on him - he was just the messenger - but he was immediately apologetic, gave us 10% off and a free side.  He was doing the best he could.  If the owner of this chain happens upon this review, I hope he/she will take some time to properly thank the young man who was doing what any owner hopes employees will do - care about the customer.
2	VDrbctWfg4mIvyw95B3Bqg	Man is this place overrated (although apparently not on Yelp). My friends think the sandwiches are really great for some reason. They're not. They're perfectly average sandwiches you could make at home with a little effort. They're not bad any means, but none of the ingredients really stand out. And the bread to interior ratio is ridiculous; I literally cut  the amount of bread on the sandwich in half and thought it was still a bit much.   This place is also an Italian grocery store of sorts, which is cool. I can only speak to the sandwiches, though.   Prices are fine, but overall this place is just "meh."
2	mxEZKWaVHc0rSZrD9qZw	I have been here for lunch several times.  Try to get in the door before 12; 11:30 if you can.  I find the service to be acceptable on most occasions, but that can slow down when the place starts packing up.  That goes the same with the food.  The food is good though.  I have tried the yellow curry and the pad thai.  Both were fresh and flavorful.  The yellow curry is one of the best I've had.  It is a good blend of spice and coconut milk.  The price is reasonable - $7 for salad, egg roll, curry and rice.  Not much to say about the decor.  The restaurant can use some sprucing up.  That doesn't bother me since I am just there for a good quick lunch.  I will definitely go back, though I am not sure if I'll put up with the wait.  Update:  Wait is way too long.  Not worth it.
4	7s1FAxR6Lzp6qWCP2cCAog	I think Chipotle pretty much has it figured out as far as fast food is concerned.  A limited number of options, which is a good thing to me, but many different ways to add to them.  You can either eat an extremely healthy meal or just a healthy meal.  There are different types of salsa, I'm a big fan of the corn salsa, as well as different beans to choose from.  The lime salt on the chips is delicious!  I could eat here at least once a week.  I'd never noticed until recently that they have tacos, but indeed, they do!
2	P6kpJvg6OdPmPp3TeGR04A	The Nascar Cafe has one redeeming quality--a decent beer selection. They've got a few microbrews on tap like Rogue, Sam Adams, and Sierra Nevada in addition to the standard fare. For a Northeasterner like myself, this warms my heart.  The food and service doesn't warm anything. It makes my heart return to its cold, frigid Boston temperature. Soon, I will remember that I'm sitting in one of the worst hotels in Vegas, in a cafe with a namesake that stems from the worst sport in history. Not even the four guys competing in the 8-pound burrito contest will make me smile.
4	Z3zTcEkUz9vCaUzfwn5Xpw	Yes, the ambiance is pretty drab and the menu is what you'd likely get at any other Mexican-American dive but it does have a somewhat unique charm and the food is pretty solid.  The family that runs it has a great track record and the consistent crowds are a good testament to its place within the Phoenix culinary community.
2	rEGiopJ9yaaXiblCf1vN1w	I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.    They thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.
4	c6HZTYMLprWKMgbAJqBJdA	I have eaten at the Veggie house several times. The food is good, but the service is normally pretty slow. Do not head here if you are in a rush.  I normally get sweet and sour pork. Pretty tasty dish. I have tried some other things, but did not particularly care for them.  This is predominantly Asian based, and pretty heavy dishes.
2	BKVKHDg7BMtEsufVkDBAQ	I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon.
4	FDyX5mReSls2Vq24Y86Ww	Visiting Florence for Country Thunder and found this little old Mexican restaurant. Our waitress was very friendly and the food is delicious!! Big portions too. Carne Asada burrito and shredded beef taco were great! Salsa is really good too! If you're craving good Mexican food and want to sit to eat visit this place!!
4	k4OppFEk8avkF2ce5WJ3lQ	we went to eat here while visiting my hubby's brother. place looked great. you could say it's more of the 'hip' scene. the music playing through the speakers made us all want to go out and do karaoke [seriously, we went all over town trying to find a magic mic haha]. anyway, the food was good, not the best though, but their Las Vegas roll was absolutely delicious. oh and we all felt a bit under dressed, everyone there was dressed like they were at a club. 4 stars only because it took forever for them to bring our order out and there were barely customers there. our waiter was some guy, didn't get his name, but he was like so mellow. He barely came to check on us. i'm pretty sure they were waiting for us to get out because my daughter and niece pretty much were running around like the place was a playground :p   -california rolls - ok - rainbow roll - ok - shrimp tempura roll - good - las vegas roll - GREAT! - mango lobster roll [?] not sure what it's called but i loved it and my husband, who's never had sushi before loved it too and even asked for another order of it :) - green tea ice cream - yummy. no one can go wrong with that!  we pretty much spent over $100 bucks [during freakin happy hour, wtf].
4	o6I1ZP27JsiAj89MQ2nvcQ	I agree with others who have mentioned the kitchen sink wings.  They are really good and I would keep coming back for them alone.  They have a nice tv set up and always have the games on.  Beer selection could be better, although they have about 8 taps with 2-3 craft options.  Apart from the wings I have tried the cheese steak which was pretty good.  One of the drawbacks of William Penn is that seating can be hard to come by, and there isn't really a great place to stand unless you want to go outside to the patio.  Service has always been good and the prices are great.
2	yC9IicIgyThsrqwTfJ4mA	Got their current promo item claiming to be a Island fire cheeseburger. The burger boasts spicy habanero sauce which actually fell very short of anything spicy. The redeeming factor is always their drinks but it's hard to get that wrong.
4	W85eHRoNLnj8yxRSiGmOUQ	One of the better fast food burger options.  They're not dry and bland like most of the major chains, and they have a lot of interesting options.  I'm partial to the Flamethrower burger which is lightly spicy and covered with a tasty creamy sauce.  Service at this location is always fast and friendly.
2	6cEbARrkyrsUgvr2i7GhRg	The food used to be great here! Now it's mediocre at best. The beer specials used to be good but now you get plastic cups. if I wanted to feel like I was at a frat party I'd stay at home. Boo. The only thing I do like about this place now is it still has a great sports crowd and is fun to be at during a Duke/Chapel Hill game or even the Pather fans have a sense of humor..... Now that I'm in Chicago and have found a dive that has awesome fish I dislike Vinnie's even more.

Waited 21 minutes for the girl to move them from the display to the plate.  And that was only after we went back up to remind her that we (the only customers in store) were still waiting.  Sad that this is the only Cinnabon location left.  Drive thru is apparently more important than customers sitting in store.

But I am not writting about the food as the server, Brandon, he was excellent.  He cleaned the tables, swept the floors, worked as a hostess, knew the menu well and made several helful recommendations.  He created substanial added value for the restaurant. Lucky GM Dina.

2	zhoRiEUqZGZ0SsvMtEIhg	For some reason in Charlotte, when the hostess tells you the wait will only be 10 minutes, it'll actually be 30 minutes. This was the 2nd time this happened in two days at two different establishments. -_-  I have never been a fan of IHOP, but will go when majority rules. Coffee is watered down, syrup bottles sticky, food mediocre at best. I got the Harvest Grain 'N Nut pancakes.. I don't really know why, but I wasn't feeling anything on the menu. Pancakes were slightly soggy and only bearable with a large helping of syrup. Hashbrowns lacked flavor and had to be doused with ketchup and hot sauce. There was a lot of hope for the New York Cheesecake Pancakes at my table..everyone was disappointed.  I suppose this place is only good if you're just looking to get really full. Service was decent, not stellar, but it's an IHOP, so it was decent.
2	GYfvX6BMjnjTFLSR1SOIA	I was so excited to see the Pita Pit had reopened after being booted so ASU can continue its construction frenzy.  I had a gyro pita--authentic, I know. (Not). Friends had the roast beef and chicken crave. They thought they were okay, but I was really disappointed because the pitas were dry and ripped from being rolled. I also remembered the pitas have more in them and being better tasting overall.  I'm hoping that if I visit again, which I'm sure I will with it being across the street, they will have gotten over these grand opening jitters.  Oh, man, I hope so.
2	kCDqwR9BrD12QGaqjzPmw	First and last time ordering from this establishment.  Salad was good, the pizza was horrible.  We ordered a white pizza thin crust. We usally order from Gus pizza. We just got used to great quality pizza from Gus. The only reason we tried this establishment is because my wife wanted a salad.  Hello and goodbye.
2	g5F9fk8HQxsN6Kq8lM0w	I would say that the sushi is mediocre at best. The rolls have a texture to them that I don't enjoy. On top of that, the prices are far too high. You might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store.
2	YdZnFPe23xkXMPXN0uRLng	The food at Manuel's remains very good, however, the service is deteriorating. The most recent time I visited the service was quick, and the person refilling water, chips, and salsa was very attentive. The manager brought out the food. I noticed that my taco had the wrong meat in.It. As I was waiting for someone to come back to the table with the rest of the table's food, the waitress came back and said the manager "brought out the wrong order because yours wasn't done yet." I hope manuel's can get their act together because my family is ready not to come back. I visit from out of state and like the food.
4	FsV8zhvuQHPKU1UsMFyk2Q	I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right.
4	sVVVCeNGs0AMeMpmbSL87A	Needed a place to stop and eat with kids on my way to Pheonix. We got a supreme and hawaian pizza and they were great. Would probably give them 3 stars under normal circumstances but give 4 for good eats in the middle of nowhere :P.   Service was good and they had accomidations for kids.   PS -  The tapwater has a off flavor in this area so order a soda or bottled water (or beer).
2	cUJM1qFQzJXPwODpTdPP0Q	It's cheap, processed, nothing facy fish and chips spot. You get what you pay for. That special sauce people rave about, don't be fooled it's nothing spectacular. If I wasn't so broke, I'd eat @ Knock Kneed Lobster
4	KTswisBKTxpUz4ZxlC7dZQ	Unless it's a chain restaurant with crappy food to begin with, I generally start my base rating of chains with 3 stars and then add or subtract depending on various factors such as cleanliness, service, etc.  I like Chipotle because they focus on getting their meat from sources that place an emphasis on the welfare of the animals.  I feel that when the animals are treated humanely during their life (not stuffed in a tiny box all their lives and walking around in their own waste) it reflects upon the taste of the meat.  As a result, I'm a big fan of their carnitas.  I feel you can really taste the difference, and if it's a few dollars more for it, it's worth it to me.  When I went here they really loaded up my burrito so I got a lot for my money, and everyone was very friendly and provided great service.  Would go here again!
4	WKeRclNtthzl0zTx2E33TA	Not the first time I have been here and won't be the last.  Good Chinese food at a good price.  The egg flower soup had a generous portion of chicken in it, making it very much like another order of food and not just an appetizer. The sun kept shining through the window as we at near sunset, so that  was the only detractor of the decor.  In addition to the soup we had the sweet and sour pork, beef broccoli, and teriyaki chicken (mostly 'cause our kids are picky.)  All were good.
2	Rf1DdWyvzIanNBCR0mMFfw	This is NOT a Japanese restaurant.  I wouldn't eat the sushi here - not saying that it isn't safe, but the tuna rolls I had (just about the simplest thing to make) weren't tasty at all.  I would best describe this place as "Asian Inspired."  It's a real hodge-podge of food styles and you KNOW you're in trouble when your "Asian" restaurant has a section in the menu for "Sandwiches."  Ugh.  I guess I'm being kind of snobbish, but if I'm going to pay $8 for sub-standard tuna rolls then I think I have a right to be.  Our total for 2 adults and one kids meal was $60 including drinks.  I would have been perfectly satisfied with the visit if the check had been half as much.  As is usual for North Phoenix/Scottsdale/Cave Creek restaurants they way overspent on decor and ambiance and totally scrimped on food quality.    This is a very bland place full of uninteresting food.
