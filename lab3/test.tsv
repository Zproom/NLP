0	ugY8oR5vxhbTd7FvgIzbFg	Went to this place after reading reviews, to my surprise I really like the place. Dimsum is 8/10 and price is very reasonable especially for quality of food they server. Only draw back is it get really crowded around noon, so arrive early around 11:30am for no wait experience.
0	RUIjgMHhE3cXoRTPcOpFnw	I love Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying Cafe Rio so when we had an opportunity to go there I jumped on it.  The decor is great and the store was very clean.  Unfortunately that is all the good there is to report.  The line was Disneyland long with stanchions and everything , there was no menu to look at while ordering food, and then I was given $17 in change...all in singles.  Overall the food was expensive and mediocre at best, with limited options.  The beans were too salty.  I don't plan on going back...

It is BYOB but they do not charge an uncorking fee.  Because I tend to like my food a little more basic (although I'm always open to new things), I like starting out with the summer rolls as an appetizer.  The consist of  leaf lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, vermicelli,  in rice paper.  The dipping sauce is homemade, and I can really taste the difference.  I like to get the steamed chicken, which is simply  chicken breast, cilantro. cucumber slices, and ginger sauce.  If I'm in the mood for something a little spicier, I like the grilled chicken with basil.  That is  grilled chicken, sliced onions, bell peppers,  eggplant, and chili sauce and basil leaf.  For those of you with food allergies, they will custom-order anything to your needs.  The service here is very good and the prices are very reasonable.

I liked the old fries, they were sometimes mushy but sooooo good! The prices are also always fluctuating, it used to be a JBC was .99 then 1.19, 1.29, and now its 1.69 I think. You can basically get a cheeseburger deluxe for like .99 but its that dang bacon that gets ya! What we usually always get are the small frosties and a small fry to dip them in it : ) YUMM!!  I like this Wendys bc theyre quick, and have great customer service! Ive never had any bad experiences... YET! LOL.   Go here for your chocolate frosty with fries fix!
0	8ofL0NmbVdPgFKDG32x3hw	Love Metro Pizza forever but I love even more that it's located in a bar and it's cheap! Great pizza and great vibes. Especially on Thursdays, buy one get one free and 1.50 hefe's! For sure my fave spot to go every Thursday.
0	SeonSfqVctLCfi08iKSG7Q	Groupon was what motivated us to check out this place.  We were pleasently surprised how good the food was.  My husband got pizza and I got the Penne ala Vodka.  They also gave us a complimentary sample of their Brucshetta which was AMAZING.  Their pizza is good (snuck a bite from my husband).  The pasta was fantastic...could immediately tell it was home made sauce, which was an added bonus.  Reasonably priced, and nice environment for families.
0	cHr07TQpNSFXhGpnpSow	Who knew such a place that just screams "huge baskets of wings and double burgers" would be so vegetarian friendly? Around my 21st birthday I had a hard time finding a mojito, so we stopped in here and got appetizers. Junk yard nachos and crab, black bean, and corn fritters were fantastic. I also discovered that mojito's aren't as good as they sound, but atleast they used real mint leaves!
0	IAcPQYIFSzGnKsAZ8yKA	I really don't know if the name of this restaurant is catchy or annoying???  I'll let you decide that.  If you have been to Gold Coast in the past couple years, you'll find that the casino has been trying to attract more and more Chinese tourists.  With Ping Pang Pong, they are able to offer the locals as well as the visitors a taste of the mother land.  That means this place serves authentic Chinese food.  We thought the amount of food for the price paid was not equal; however, even to us Asians the food was quite tasty.
0	9RXlX1jVsSRESfeMI2vlLg	We tried the taco cart with Taqueria Guadalajara for a recent party.... Sadly it wasn't that great of an experience.  We requested a certain cook, they promised us over and over the cook would be there, when they showed up, they replaced the cook with another person.   However, that wasn't that big of a deal.... They were supposed to show up at 3pm when the party started but didn't arrive until 4:30PM.  Apparently Arizona Freeways are very confusing and they couldn't figure out how to get to the East Valley.   Instead of keeping me in the loop on when they were coming, I ended up having to call them every 15 minutes after they were extremely late..   Thankfully for their sake, their food is excellent... However I wouldn't trust them to show up at any of my parties going forward.
0	u2yfUwKCeASh2NMXrB7KRw	I don't eat fried chicken very often, as a kid growing up in Texas, I remember my father having Church's once a week for lunch.  I would come in from school and he'd be at the table eating, reading his new paper, and there in the chair next to him, our family cat, waiting patiently for a nibble.    So today while out and about town, my husband had a great idea, let's try Church's. The Louisiana chicken place by the house had closed for some time now, so it made sense to try it again.  Crunchy, juicy, hot out of the fryer, this chicken is delicious. I had a side of fried okra and enjoyed my meal.  I haven't had Church's in such a long time, I had forgotten how it tasted.
0	YNwYePm3YBBHi2jnSaOmPQ	We ate here a coulpe of days ago and were quite satisfied. It is sparkeling clean with a very friendly attentive staff.  We ordered:  Hot and souer soup which was just allright, some what lacking in taste. Hunan Chicken, very good and spicy as it should be. Nice medly of chicken and vegetables. Kung Pow Chicken, again spicy as it should be. A mixture of chicken and vegetables, a little heavy on the baby corn.
0	lSUA7UE5sQCKckycCGywA	Went there with my boyfriend...I ordered the BLT...I've had BETTER!  It tasted a little sour, like sourdough bread...I asked for white bread. Also, I asked for coleslaw as the side....got chips!  The server looked very bored and she was hovering...very annoying just so you know!  And please, get some sweet n low!  I will say this,  my boyfriend ordered the Cuban Panini and his was good.  Would I go back..maybe if it is busier so I don't feel like I am being watched and IF they get my order right.
0	TyaQnrsPsNWIpatvVRuA	I won't go into all the details of Roy's. It's a chain and while the menu varies from place to place - it doesn't vary all that much. I personally love the chain It's got great hawaiin and asian-fusion food with "americanized" accents. They make great drinks...even the arnold palmer here tastes better than in other places.  But let me focus on this one in Summerlin for a minute. The two or three times I went, the service was pretty sharp. The location is great only if you happen to live or be staying in Summerlin. It's a bit of trek for tourists from the Strip. It stays fairly quiet inside which is nice and a bit of a change from most other members of the chain. No smoking except in the bar - which is a plus (this is Nevada after all).
0	AIrFhwTSumOQ64LLvoMZLw	This is my favorite quasi-Mexican restaurant in the city. It is not entirely authentic, so don't expect that, but it is good. I personally enjoy big burritos that are stuffed and wrapped in foil (seriously, no sarcasm here) with a nice selection of beer. I highly, highly recommend their pulled pork or Acapulco burrito!  They also have awesome daily specials on drinks and it is just an all-around chill place to hang out with friends. I love this place!
0	VuUc0yVVRYdtt71Xm9meA	Let's start with...  they are trying.  I made a reservation for 7pm, 2 people.  My son decided to join us so I called and asked to add a third and they could not accommodate us.  No big deal since it was an hour before our reservation so I figured it was a long shot anyway.  But to my surprise they called me back 5 minutes later and told me they had a cancellation so they could take the three of us.  We ordered the stuffed hot peppers to start.  The sauce was good, the peppers were small but tasty.  My wife ordered the eggplant rollatini, son ordered the special cheese tortellini and I ordered the linguini with clam sauce.  The were all average at best.  A step above OG and the other Italian places that focus on volume not quality.  I am amazed this place finishes 3rd in the Pittsburgh magazine readers poll.  In summary, good not great, but they are trying.
0	3IK3aWWADi3mUYzzXFmxQ	like others before us-we were trying to go to hash house a go go!!! but who knew we had to specify between 3 different places (now that there is one on the strip)....but anyways-it was TINY!!! and the staff was very homely...buuutttttttt think about it-why are you going there?? for a good breakfast and they didn't disappoint....i ALWAYS order my hash browns extra crispy and this was the first time in my entire life that they were actually cooked to crispyness....prices were great...i mean-who doesn't love paying 'normal' prices for stuff in vegas!!! idk if i would go back but you won't leave disappointed!
0	niZJBme5yVfB67AI7HquCQ	It was okay.  I probably won't return.  I had the carne asada fry bread and the meat had a lot of gristle.  The bread itself had no crisp which Is my personal preference and the beans were tasteless. The salsa tasted like mere tomato sauce.  The place on 7th is way more authentic and tasty.   That said, the portion is big enough for two to share and the staff is friendly.
0	Jy9OiLM9GOcagXf9Ycp6g	Summarizing my experience in one word: Deception.  Today, I walked into the food court hungry after finishing some errands at the mall. I met a manager waiting outside handing out samples of great tasting samples. The lady at the counter also gave me some samples. They were seducing. I'll admit that I did get the three entr\u00e9e meal, pepper chicken and the types they let me try. The staff was attentive and filled me a side of soy sauce when I forgot to grab some since the bottles were not labeled.  The food tasted great and filled me up. It was great... at first.  After I was half way through, I noticed that I had an unbearable salty taste in my mouth. I was wondering if there was simply too much salt on my food. I did not even finish the food completely. I was feeling full when there was still rice.  I actually got measured and tried on suits at the clothes store nearby afterwards. I felt  like my belly was sticking out the whole time. I wanted to make sure such a sharp looking suit would fit nicely even though my abdomen was a little large than it should be. Still, I finished after an hour or so and returned home.  When I got home I drank some water, and did a few chores, cleaning dishes, laundry. I drank some water again. I realized that I was really thirsty and that my stomach still felt bloated. I knew that there was something I was suspecting when I had my lunch, I wondered if the food had MSG mixed in to it.   For those of you who don't know what MSG is, look it up. Sodium glutamate is safe, naturally occurring nonessential amino acid. It's like adding a type of salt and sugar to your food just to make it taste better. It's a cheap, unhealthy way to make customers believe that the food they are eating is awesome. The problem that I have with MSG is that it makes me feel really bloated and I can tell my body has trouble fighting hard trying to clean it out.   I never want MSG mixed into my food and I may consider simply asking before hand whether it is an ingredient in the food at all. Personally, I find it irresponsible for a restaurant to use it simply for profit. As a prospective businessman, there are certain things that I will not tolerate being traded for short term profit. Customer health and welfare is one of them.   Please stop using MSG or at least put signs stating clearly and truthfully whether you do or do not add MSG into your foods at any stage of preparation. In case anyone disagrees with my views is why I explained clearly and transparently why I gave the two star rating I gave so you will have the opportunity to respond to this review or consider whether it is a valid rating.
0	Vauu23zvAcf1V13hYKUg	A great place to grab a good burger and fries at 2 in the morning. One time my husband picked out some songs to play on the jukebox but he didn't  put the right numbers in.  So Michael Bolton was blasted through the restauraunt at 2 am.  I don't understand why anyone would have Michael Bolton in the jukebox anyway????
0	PF920lRIGWh6shZs2qRwwg	I was disappointed because the place said they open at 10:30, I arrived 5 mins before they were supposedly opening at along with 3-4 other people. As it was time for them to open the door was not. One by one customers were leaving I was the last one standing and finally the door opened at 10:45. I placed a hot and ready order and still had to wait another 5-10 min. I expected the door to be open at 10:30 as it advertise and the hot and ready READY to be serve. On the plus side I got my food fresh and hot.
0	sL2jU7elOcVwFAcemMgTPw	First, this location is a dual KFC/LJS so you don't the full menu and you should count yourself lucky if you don't get food poisoning after eating.  What I got though was some fish that looked good but tasted odd, I can't place what the taste was other possibly some chemical added to the batter.  Hushpuppies and slaw was good, service wasn't bad either but when you got to a fish place (even a fast food fish place) you expect decent food.
0	CnMgdI82PSIg8mbNN8qbg	I had been talking with someone at work last week, and they suggested this a a great place for an inexpensive, great-tasting pizza.  So we sallied forth, infiltrated the place of purveyance and negotiated the vending of some combustibles.  In a word: average.  In several words: the pizza was alright, the cheesy bread was good, and the hot wings were OK.  Maybe we got there on a bad night (it WAS 110 degrees at 6:PM), so I don't know.  All in all though, I'll still go to Napoli.
0	Hq1xDJgWdBR8kyVn4weMTA	Took my kids and nieces here awhile back. It's like the are trying to bring a little bit of Scottsdale to Surprise. Upscale designer food with upscale designer prices.   Not good for kids, over priced. In a bowling alley you need options for kids - families. This isn't it. There should be something for them. The Alley is big enough to have a mom and pop diner among the mix.   Good for dates, couples, over 21 people. Good for those who want to spend $20 on a caesar salad and soda. Which the salad sucked. My bill was over $90 (not incl tip) for 3 adults and 3 kids, for lunch!
0	w0JsaeVy1V0zztPSBIwIDA	I went for the lunch buffet with Rand H and thought the place was pretty good .It is a large restaurant with lots of comfy seating. The food selection was a little more than 70 trays and of the 30 or so i tasted were all very good .They were your typical Chinese buffet selections but done just a little bit better than most. For example the chicken wings that are usually pretty much the same everywhere were very yummy here and the mushrooms were stuffed with some kind of cream cheese stuffing those were 5 star.the chinese donuts were only average {crunchy on the bottom} and usually i really like those ,i know you have to get them as soon as they come out of the kitchen to avoid the crunchies.The rest of the sweets were pretty taste all and all when i left hunan vIII i was very full and happy which should be the case at any place i give 4 stars to.Yay i am a fan!!!!
0	0FOG3UHqikxJZ5mi1DfJQA	I like Jason's Deli. I'm not real picky but I just don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews.  I love their salad bar because it is simple yet always super fresh with a good amount of dressing options.  Their sandwichs have always impressed me and the soups are great and made fresh everyday.  They are a no trans fat place and most of their stuff is organic.  I think its great but maybe I just suck. Who knows.
0	ZPubraKqDnmoijPMjdbg	I would recommend this restaurant for late munchies, if you're craving sushis at night and everything else is already closed.  Sushis and sashimis combos were ok. Nothing special here, just fine. When you buy 2 of these, 2nd is 50% off.   Service was pretty good, maybe because it was so late restaurant was empty.
0	FklVl3lAK99nM84k4wYnA	I love greek food so after a heavy night of drinking, a GYRO was the only thing on my mind. I went to the Fashion Show Mall with my boyfriend and headed straight for the food court and thought I died and went to heaven because there it was, a gyro spot! I briskly walk over and order my gyro, and it came out within 3 minutes! I also love eating my gyros with really spicy hot sauce and they had an awesome hot sauce there!! It was expensive, I think 8 or 9 bucks, which is the average when you're in Vegas so I'm not complaining. The night before I spent 15 bucks for a meal I did not enjoy at all so 9 was wonderful. They don't accept credit cards though, thank goodness I had cash otherwise I would have been a super unhappy camper. It's 2010, come on! Credit cards should be widely accepted, especially in Vegas! But other than that, tasty food.
0	qsYWrA96G6M22OIzSMslg	The ambiance of Little Buddha is amazing.  There is no denying that this place is very cool and sexy.  The dark, red, lounge like  inside is a really nice contrast to the day glow decor of the casino.    My friends and I came here for a light dinner before going out.  The food and service was very good.  Definitely a fun, cool way to start the night.
0	cahe0l3XvF8QWwFoffwHDQ	The food is sub-par in comparison to other sub shops here in Madison.  But today just put me over the edge.  I ordered a lunch box special and iced tea.  W/tax, tip and delivery charge, it came to $14.  The driver arrived with ONLY my sandwich.  I'm like wha???  She apologized and said she would be right back with the chips and iced tea.  A half hour later I called the store and the guy on the phone tells me she hasn't even gotten back to the store, they are really busy and would I accept a store credit.  I accepted it but now I wish I hadn't.  I now wish I put my boots and coat on and walked to the BP and got a mocha frappe, a bag of chips and made some type of sandwich or soup here at home.  Would have cost less, for sure.  Don't bother with Silver Mines.  Cousins is much better (even though they don't deliver) and Pita Pit on State St is fab!  I cannot brag enough about Pita Pit!  Fresh food, great service, quick delivery...too many places to choose from to accept less-than-stellar service and food.
0	993Dh1dvQZFfInQdfzWuMA	We ordered the shellfish tower, steak, lobster bisque, and lobster mac. (Yes, we love lobster). Bananas Foster for dessert.  The soup was cold so we had to send it back. After it was warmed up, it was absolutely fantastic!!!  We ordered the steak encrusted with bleu cheese. It didn't come with bleu cheese so we needed to get it on the side.  The shellfish tower was way overpriced for the quantity of what you actually get. Way overpriced.  The lobster mac was great. However, this $13.00 side came in a tiny little bowl. It was way too small.  Bananas Foster was mouth watering. Delicious!  The customer service was wonderful.  My overall impression is that this place is just simply overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you receive. Your money is better spent somewhere else.
0	Wk54nnTr01Bo5sRzU1PGIQ	Wow! Blown away.   Dined here with a dear friend from Argentina, who deemed this place one of the most authentic in the 'burgh, and I concur. With mad high fives.  This place is Mexican, versus the Tex Mex that you find more frequently. I ordered the tortilla soup with extra avocado and OH my! The broth was the perfect balance of spice, thick with flavor. The tortilla strips where homemade and slightly crunchy. The portion size was just right, although I could have licked the bowl clean if I'd been in the privacy of my home. The decor is nothing fancy, but modest with authentic Mexican flags, paintings and photographs (there is a super rad painting of Zapata right as you walk in that I wanted to make off with!)  Four stars for the lack of fish that day- they were all out, per the waitress. Parking is kinda rough as well, but do yourself a favor and pay the $10 to park in the Macy's lot. It's worth it!!!
0	jwT8w1Z7bUgi1d0TtZXzUQ	Nothing spectacular on the menu, the gas station location is a royal pain (parking especially), and they lack some basic Mexican food items on the menu.  About the only good thing I can say is that the daily specials are often a screaming deal, such as a bean burrito for $1 (no cheese though, and they wouldn't let me add cheese, even at a nominal cost).
0	EhBLdkljkCg4BUH3zCQjnw	We went here on a Friday night at prime time, around 7:30 pm only to see four other tables in the restaurant. These were the only four tables that remained in the restaurant for the next couple of hours it took for us to finish our dining experience. Perhaps it would have been better if every single dish ordered by each person came out at the same time. Literally every item, cold or hot, sushi or hibachi came out separate from each other, leaving the other three to watch. Not just separate but with at least ten minutes surrounding the periods of waiting for the other dishes to come out. My sushi was mediocre at best. My boyfriend got a sashimi bowl with a giant piece of raw garlic (???) that took over and ruined the entire dish. I would love to see this restaurant do well, but that task is up to the kitchen staff and management to run a proper restaurant where patrons can eat together at the same time.
0	Sm8W3kQgEMdCZCyReftV9w	Let me start out by saying that the food was good and the staff attentive but there was just something that totally turned me off...too bright colors, too kitchy decor, a funky smell when we walked in...I'm not sure but I know I'd be hesitant in going back or recommending this place.  The weird cut out people on the top of the booths made me think someone was constantly sticking their head into our booth.  It wasn't busy at all, tho more people were coming in as we were leaving.  Maybe it does deserve another try.
0	svqfPf2BPpvUXlGzxBXQg	The dirty O  God, i used to head here after high school when I went shopping at Teleropa and just had to rebel from my ideal suburban parents.  Cheese fries... no, that isn't descriptive enough.  A WHOLE basket of deep dried goodness, covering the red plastic tray and falling to the floor as you searched for a table in this iconic grease ladden Pittsburgh hang out.
0	EFHxPwQkVzIRVxLP5NCEA	Below is my first review of this restaurant in which I raved about how good the Pizza was but after our second dining experience I have to give them 2 stars. Tonight the pizza crust was soggy and the flavors were only ok. The Chicago Meat Calzone was just nasty full of onions and again a soggy crust. What a shame as we were so excited to have found good pizza but if you cant be consistent you cant have my business. We wont go back and pay premium prices for anything less than perfection. This place offers no deals and sporadic quality.  MY FIRST REVIEW BELOW  We've had every type of crappy pizza you might imagine over the years so it was a great suprise when we ordered the spinach pizza and small calzone stuffed with spaghetti noodles, sausage and ricotta cheese. All of these items where bursting with flavor and for the first time since New York we could actually smell the garlic on the pizza. This pizza packs a flavor punch and I was out the door for under $25.00 with enough food to feed a family of four. I did take out for our first dining experience but now that they have set the hook we will return in short order for the in house treatment. So far highly recommended.  4/14/2012 THIRD REVIEW UPDATE- RAISED THEM FROM TWO BACK TO FOUR STARS.  My wife loves this Pizza otherwise I would have never went back to give them another chance but two visits later I am firmly convinced my bad experience was a fluke.  The Pizza has been excellent and full of flavor.
0	KChWDlyNtAmW7v51AXA	The pizza is legit.   I worked late last night so my lunch break was pretty much my dinner. They have a special that includes a large pizza with 2 toppings and a 2 liter soda for $17.95. The pizza is pretty big in size and we choose the ham and pineapple combination.   I would like to see what kind of oven they use because the crust is always delicious. It has some char on the bottom and a little crunch towards the end of the pie.   Go with the pizza!
0	kFYskg8nx3wlR7o5OUL2Q	Why you ask is a vegan giving a steakhouse 4 stars? Actually, why is a vegan even going to a steakhouse at all? Because she's probably adopted and the preferred twin was given the luxury of choosing the restaurant for the night. Sometimes I dream of the green parents that celebrated every monumental event at Cafe Gratitude and unfortunately had to leave me behind. In Concord. Either way-my family is screwed up.  Back to Delmonico's, this is actually my second visit, first time was in 2000. Even then they accommodated my needs. Now they actually have a vegetarian option but alas, no vegan dish.   No problem-when you've so obviously been dragged along to a place with a bunch of meat eaters, people sometimes take pity on you. It's kind of fun to tell people what you absolutely will not tolerate and see what they give you. Dating should be more like this but that's another review. I was served pasta with different veggies like asparagus and green beans. Not amazing but not bad. An A for effort.  I should probably mention the dead animals that Delmonico's specializes in. Yes-they're dead. But my family loved what they ordered and sucked the bones dry.  Excellent service and the bartender made a tasty kir royal.
0	JKaBbxFrrSStJ0tY21y2g	New spicy chicken sandwich rocks!  They started taking orders in person at the drive-thru during lunch time rush to push customers through quicker.  This place is always clean, and the service is beyond any other fast food place.  Plus all sandwiches are under 500 calories!  Oh and the lemonade here is heaven, not that crap you get in the fountain machines at normal places.
0	TdEpWVi0PK3703bkBIqQ	This used to be a good place to go in a pinch for a quick lunch.  But the service has really gone down hill. If you go through the drive thru .. DO NOT EXPECT to get packets of sauce even when you ask for them.  Also don't expect your drink occasionally because they think they gave it to you. The food is good..  But the service really has taken a turn for the worse here. I hope they get it together soon.
0	Zavy5RJWwjthWbkrwArZjA	Like I have said before, this is a chain restaurant, the menu is the same anywhere you go, the food tastes the same, the decor is the same, the dinning experience, is not always the same.  While on our vacation, our group of friends had come up with a scavenger hunt of sorts where we were supposed to do certain dares. One of these dares was to eat food off of the plate of someone you did not know. Enter: the Cheesecake Factory. One of my friends decided to take this dare on and noticed a family getting up from their meal (children included). They had left some plates of half-eaten cheesecake on their table and she saw this as her opportunity.  Before the family had even left, she walked up, picked up a fork and took a big bite of their cheesecake, smiled and walked back to our table. The looks on their faces were victory enough.  I'm pretty sure the rest of our meal involved specialty drinks from their bar so I can't accurately comment on the food, or really anything else that happened. ;)
0	OdsGHDbWTdcgH7dZrym1Fg	We go to Tradiciones on a somewhat regular basis and love to take the out of towner's there to enjoy the atmosphere and the good food.  The only real thing I am not as thrilled with Tradiciones is that if you want to have a conversation it can be tough at times with the regular mariachi's playing (don't get me wrong they are good and entertaining).  The patio is really nice once it cools down a little outside!  Their Mole' is a sweet / spicy which is a little different and good!
0	x5iFegiDCWlC7emhMMXw	Nice little Sports Bar. Shawn the bartender is a doll.  Chicago Pizza? Not so much. I'm fat and know Chicago Pizza. This Pizza wasn't close. Otherwise- it's a bar. There's alcohol and sports...what else do you need?
0	Wown2RJzJVLmFpU2QP2L4g	A theme type restaurant. Definitely a go to place for fun and late night jaunts. They do line dancing,ride the bull,etc...It's a bit disconcerting when you first go in-a huge room,with booths along the wall,and seating in the middle,with a full third of the space taken up by the bull. There is a bar,and behind the bar, a few more booths. We preferred sitting there,actually. A bit more quiet and private. As far as the food goes,I think it's more hype than substance. I was actually really disappointed in it. After seeing it on tv in Los Angeles on numerous dating shows,I was anxious to see what it was about.  We went for dinner and had steak-nice selection of food on the menu,and a good selection of sides,but the steaks were just ok.  We also tried it for breakfast on the weekend-we need more breakfast places around here so I was really happy they were open weekend mornings--what can I say-a little disappointing.. The hash browns were actually inedible they were so dry!!! I am not too anxious to try it again!
0	JmhGUEwRBbh04uoOEVzDsw	Employees a few years ago were wonderful, friendly.  Staff has changed and the new manager was extremely rude.  Went back a few weeks ago and seems like things have turned around (thank goodness this is very close to my house).  Managers are wonderful and the staff great now.
0	Xv9MDfqhoMPX0QttrcDJg	Underwhelmed by our dining experience at Searsucker...there are so many better chef-driven restaurants in Scottsdale. Very trendy decor, but the dining experience just does not delivery. Chef Malarkey roamed the dining room promoting the Taste, but he would have better served his restaurant had he spent the evening in the kitchen.  The entire dining experience was rushed -- we were in and out for dinner in little more than and hour.  The eggs and bacon small plate was cold, which was sad because the flavors were promising. The chicken and waffles and franks small plate was also cold.  The filet was underwhelming.  The short rib small plate was redeeming. The duck fat fries were greasy and, again, cold. The brussel sprouts were, well, burnt, (not caramelized) and doused in vinegar.  It is disappointing that a meal that was so rushed, was served cold. The server was also not interested in our comments about dinner, disappointed we opted not to order dessert.  We will choose to dine elsewhere and skip the hype of Searsucker.

The print on the expiration date was small and had expired 2 days earlier. When I presented it the cashier said "yeah it's expired, if you want your order there will be no discounts". The food isn't that good to take that abuse. Shame on you guys!!!!
0	Mb6CdFxfADrSPlvo67fxJQ	My new thing is looking for happy hour sushi places.  I LOoOOve sushi but can't afford to spend the usual $10 ++ on a roll.  Happy hour is from 4-7 pm and 10-12 pm EVERYDAY!  Sushi is not only half price, it's fricken' good.  Service has always been exceptional whenever I've been here.  If you choose to go Teppan-Yakki, the chef puts on an entertaining show and like, 5 courses.    There's a Sapporo back where home in Monterey, CA but the one in Las Vegas is completely different.  Hip, edgy, modern decor and if you do go during happy hour they play music videos of BSB, 98 Degrees, Destiny's Child and other groups to relive my high school days!
0	lGzUo6SdUjwycCjFP2ZYw	I really love jimmy johns and most locations are 'freaky fast' as they should be... But NOT this location! Every time I order from this locations it takes from 45 minutes to an hour to deliver (Note that I live 0.7mi from the location). Other than that, sandwiches are real good!
0	eWfgIK4CBb620rsXBB2Iw	The waitress was the daughter of the owner. Probably about twelve at most. Did an ok job I guess. But very unprofessional as she was in a sweatshirt. None of the tables we sat at were balanced and kept tilting. The food itself was barely decent. Tolerable but nothing to write home about. My friend went to the restroom and we almost left based off that so as you can guess not good. Many cleaner better food Indian restos here in Vegas.
0	s04kJnmlCTAqETAA6LPlNQ	I have been to 2 locations, Fish Hatchery and Lien, and both times was uninterested in finishing my meal.  Stale tortillas, bad cheese, bland sauces... go to Taqueria El Pastor or Taqueria Guadalajara for tastier, more authentic meals.  Heck, you can do slightly better just down the road at Casa del Sol.
0	UqPsyrquHvieTD4VLCuI4w	I wandered into the Weary Traveler and saddled up to the bar both weary and hungry, having braved the frigid cold walk from my apartment.  The friendly wait staff served me up with a "West of the Andes" sandwich (w/ steak) and a tasty beer from one of their taps.  The sandwich was just the right size, scrumptious, and decently priced.  Service was quick around 5:30pm on a Saturday, but I have a feeling it gets quite busy later in the evening.  Looks to be a fun place to hang out with a group.
0	LcOrSrUBSa8Fd75h3L21hg	This place is close to my office so we hit it up for lunch from time to time.  I've only tried one thing on the menu, and it was pretty tasty.  The portions are healthy and the service is quick.  I planned on trying a few other items on the menu so I'll definitely be back.
0	FhCer1XuSqpabhQK3ODDQ	Gorgeous just like the Wynn!  In continuation of our shop , drink, drink, drink, shop we decided to eat a little more.  We sat at the bar and had a few Grey gooses and mussels. UMMM, the mussel's were very good. The little broth that it had was very flavorful and rich. At the bottom of the plate was a generous piece of grilled bread to soak it up. The bar staff was great and attentive. The decor was beautiful yet understated for the over the top Wynn. I wish we would have stayed for dinner but we had other bars to hit.
0	yCGSsj8TgnAuRudfGVjFOw	I went there with a friend on a Sunday night. We both had 1/4 chicken, i took a side of veggie rice and my friend took a side of poutine. We both found the chicken to be extremely dry, they were so cheap on the sauce i barely had any even on the chicken skin. The rice was okay but lacked seasoning and my salad had lettuce so old the leaves had dark greyish spots on them. My friend ate her poutine but said the sauce was tasteless and the fries were very soft.  Compared to Romados, the portions were ridiculously small, the limp salad taking half the plate, leaving little room for the rest.  I would give the food a 4/10. The service was almost nonexistent and rude. Also, if you're going to drink water, bring your own water bottle because theirs are overpriced, like everything else on the menu is for the mediocre quality you get.  I would definitely not recommend it. Better walk a bit farther and go to Romados next time.
0	uLb9crNA11WlOKAogNXIQ	This pizza place has become one of my favorites with the Sicilian jersey ranch pizza making my top choice with a side of their garlic knots. They deliver, they feed you there, they make great food and Im having it for dinner :)
0	veuayqjoBV2GRS3WiusV6Q	I have a habit of taking my wife to a real ritzy restaurant on her birthday, she likes to treat it like a national holiday. So after looking around for a new place to try out, I settled on this very nice restaurant. That was kind of the problem, it was just nice.  I don't know, I have nothing bad to say. The calamari app was good, The different breads were ok. We got completely confused by the cheese menu. I ordered a NY Steak and my wife got the Halibut. Both were good but not spectacular. The decor is REALLY impressive (especially for an office park). Prices were a little cheaper than expected which was appreciated.   I do have to say that the service was exeptional though, our drinks were always refilled and we never noticed anyone do it. We hate when the servers are always hovering and this woman was not like that at all...a real pro  I guess we just left after a nice enough dinner but we've had much better and much worse.  OH! and a friend turned me on to cucumber gimlets here...get one...y'know, or 7.
0	1Ey7rIetQrKL0p97wQMlw	Hallo Leute  . ich war heute im Besitos in Karlsruhe, Ich gehe \u00f6fter in Mainz ins Besitos, wo eigentlich immer alles mindestens 4 Sterne verdient.  Hier in Karlsruhe war das leider nicht so. Der Laden ist schon deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer aber das darf keine Auswirkung auf die Qualit\u00e4t haben. Ich habe mir Gambas ala brasa bestellt, da sagte die Bedienung sor h\u00e4tten heute kein Aioli, OK hab ich Mojo Rojo genommen und einen Rioja bestellt. Der Wein viel zu kalt, die Gambas, die Schale war kaum ab zu bekommen. Das dazu servierte  Brot zu hart. Schade das ist sehr verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig.
0	dJ089myedQVEbbaEDhSKgg	For those of you not familiar with the area, this plaza is usually dead quiet and has very little traffic. The busiest sections of the plaza are Walmart on one corner and the Rubio's/Saba's/Starbucks strip on the very opposite corner. Ritz is located just across from this fairly busy strip so it seems like it's worth a try. I had a craving for sushi so the hubby and I decided to give this place a try since it just recently opened.   I wanted to love this place, I really did. We arrived yesterday evening (Sunday) at about 5:30pm and the place was eerily empty. There was one other couple sitting in a booth when we arrived and servers standing around talking to one another b/c well, they didn't really have much to do. What makes it worse is that the layout of the place makes it feel even MORE empty since everything seems to be spaced out in a weird way. Maybe when all the tables are full this is a trait that one can appreciate but when empty it just looks a little sad.   I ordered a spicy tuna roll, a salmon nigiri and a masago. I don't think the sushi was bad, per se, but I've definitely had better. The construction of the sushi just didn't look authentic and the texture of the spicy tuna was just not what I'm used to. The one good thing I can point out is that their sushi rice is sweet and sticky just like it's supposed to be. My husband also ordered a philly roll and wasn't really impressed. The salmon got lost amongst the larger servings of cream cheese which, hey, if you're a cream cheese fiend then it may be right up your alley.  Aside from the sushi, my husband got an order of pad thai and we were both really disappointed. It doesn't taste bad at all but it seriously lacked flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Again, as was the case with the sushi, it just seemed to lack something in authenticity and flavor that we immediately took notice of.  The service was not bad although it was a bit slow considering there wasn't much for the servers to do at that time. There are a lot of other menu options that perhaps are more impressive. Unfortunately, we probably won't be going back to test that theory out. In our opinion the food was barely decent and the prices are just OK. This place has lived up to our experience with most Asian fusion restaurants trying to serve Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese and every other Asian cuisine under the sun all under one roof....it just doesn't work. With so many unique flavors and styles it's likely that you're not going to specialize in any of them and more likely that all of them will be under par.   But I'm not a mean person so I do want to point out that this place is brand new and may just be ironing out the wrinkles so to speak. I'd be open to coming back if we hear that reviews are becoming more positive than not or if neighbors/friends have different experiences. SO, if you happen to give this place a try...let me know what you think.
0	7Z5OpmEEfpkNZ2ZEAdHMA	Went here for the seafood buffet, $15.99, well worth it for las vegas fremont/downtown area. got in line 3:45pm it opened right at 4pm, so didn't wait long to get our table.  went here specifically for the snow/crab legs, they were easy to crack (a little too soft, almost), had a little slit in each leg to make it easier to extract crab meat. lots were stocking up on the crab legs, but the staff kept replenishing the goods, didn't have to wait for the next batch ever. after 3 plates, went for one last plate of some baby back ribs, corn, collared greens, then finally blueberry cheesecake/ice cream for desert.   waiter was very accomodating. didn't even have to ask, he brought extra napkins, a cracker, drinks were filled up, and a wipe for afterwards. tipped him 20%...   don't expect a bellagio or rio buffet, but for the price it is very well worth it, it is much better than the fremont hotel paradise buffet down the way.
0	vG2EHV2QUJt5J9S9bEnw	shopping is a serious sport and sometimes you need some sustenance to help you continue on.   what i ate: - roast beef panini - bagel with cream cheese  pros: - food was pretty good. everything was made well and the way you ordered it - decor: the pods were a fun and chic place to sit and rest from all the crazy shopping at city center. true with the style of the rest of the city center the pods were very well decorated - alcohol: they serve alcohol, but itll cost you an arm.  cons: - PRICE: good god the prices were outrageous. the roast beef sandwich was $10 and for that price i expect waiter service. the bagel was $4. a yogurt parfair was $6. it was so expensive that i didnt even order anything to drink.   would i come again? not unless i was dying of hunger while shopping.
0	I1lTpwWq2LCn1FHp4feyQ	I recently went to Maharani on a Friday night and was quite pleased with my experience -- good food...pleasant atmosphere...friendly wait staff...reasonable prices...and convenient location.  Yet this was my first time eating Indian cuisine in Madison, so my ability to compare it to others in the area is somewhat limited.  That being said, I found the food wonderfully tasteful and the atmosphere enjoyable.  The naan and dipping sauces were as good as any I had ever tasted.  My spiced lamb dish was so delicious I couldn't stop talking about it after we left.  Unfortunately my companion didn't necessarily share the same level of enthusiasm for her dish (tandoori chicken), but promised that it would not discourage her from making a return visit in the future.  Which reminds me...the wait staff was fantastic!  Very attentive and personable.  I thought the prices were relatively reasonable considering the cuisine.  Both of our dishes cost around $12, and the food portions were sufficiently large.  The clientle during our visit included two older couples (60's), several middle-aged couples (mid-40's), and a family of five with three relatively young children.  It probably wouldn't be my first choice of somewhere to take kids, but it certainly wouldn't be out of the question...depending on the kids and/or the parent's level of patience.  All in all, Maharani provided a great alternative to other local restaurants around the capitol.  When you need a break from Great Dane's fish fry, The Old Fashioned's mac & cheese, or Brocach's shepherd's pie, I would recommend heading down the W. Washington spoke of the square and hit Maharani.
0	GM1d5eQByx6OhOPORnak2Q	Stumbled upon Chef Ben's and decided give it a shot. Gotta say the prices are what brought us (my daughter and I) in. It seemed fairly priced, clean looking, yet it was not quite welcoming. We ordered the chicken teriyaki,  teriyaki two, and what is usually my favorite, the eel roll. I was completely unsatisfied, the chicken was dry, the beef seemed to be low quality and a bit dry as well. I was most let down by the roll though. I asked the gentleman taking my order "is the eel fresh water or not?" His response, "yes." I definitely do not believe it to have been fresh water at all. I have had eel numerous times and at plenty places yet have never had such a salty and fishy tasting roll. The taste was overwhelming and I could not force myself to suck down a second bite.
0	ofw5P41QWTrxUt2xIU0SQ	This Wendy's is actually a pretty nice location and they have great service.   Of all the Wendy's, that I have been to this location seems to take their time with your order. They smile when they speak to you and they always ask if there is anything else they can do for you. It's rare to see good customer service at a fast food location these days.   The inside seating is clean and smells fresh. If you're looking to eat fast food but still stay on the health side, I would always recommend Wendy's since they have substitutions for fries and a good number of choices for salads.   They definitely fit in with the rest of the Chandler establishments as well.
0	N6g6Eh2J48GAm1tht5eqsg	I had been wanting to try this place out and they happened to do a Groupon on 12-22-10, which I purchased. Sunday is one of my dinner nights so I went with my fiance and our 19 month old out to Tempe.    When we arrived they said there would be a short wait, which was not a problem. The hostest then informed us that they only have one high chair and it was in use. Bummer...we had to go elsewhere.
0	k6K4ms0W6xLV6NjK4KTxg	What a disappointment.   The only tea they have is sweet tea.  Very sad.  One order taker two points of sale.  If you want ranch with your onion rings there is an additional charge.   Nickel and dime.
0	rlVWJhwiONzyW8yHj3esKg	i really dig this place for its uniqueness and the sushi.  you'll find several one-of-a-kind sushi recipes here, and so far I've found them all to be delicious.  when your sushi is served, you can tell right away that the people preparing it care.  it looks beautiful and the taste matches.  no fishy smell at this place, either -- a big plus for a sushi bar, imo.  definitely worth a try.
0	RLZsqwzzm0dDuJfkobFjJQ	So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.  First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.   Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...  This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps.
0	Uba1yQS1EZbxvjzIzrCSBg	This was my first time trying a Jersey Mikes sandwich.  I have to say it was really good. I had the roast beef, with just pickles and pepper.  The roast beef had a great taste, and was quite tender. The bread was crusty and crunchy, which I prefer.  The staff was nice and helpful. I was in and out of there in 5 minutes.  I will come back to try the other sandwiches.
0	oa7PVxGHDlAYWF7gxMxvA	My dad went here when it was still a brewery, and still recommended it to me knowing the brewery was no more.  I had the steak and stein which was a great combo.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the beers, menu, prices, etc.  I would return if I found myself at the Monte Carlo again.
0	3Nye6pdt7v27VMagvDxGw	This place is fairly new and the decor shows how clean it is.  But it doesn't give me the HotPot vibe.  It  was pretty empty when I went there for dinner and it's a Southeast Asian decor.  And I thought Hot Pot is mainly a Chinese thing.    I had the Ying Yang pot (spicy and plain on the two sides of the pot).  The pork broth produces a strong flavor for the soup.  All the spices in the two sides made the base very strong and flavorful.  Actually it almost seemed a bit too heavy for my taste. And the spicy side is very spicy (at least to me).  For the additional sauces they had their own version of soy sauce and a peanut sauce.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I didn't use it that much.  But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor.  The napa especially soaked up the spicy broth very nicely.  I like drinking the broth after the meal to relax my stomach, but the strong broth is more like a starter soup instead of an ending soup.  We had the shabu beef and lamb.  They were sliced thinly, but the meat just didn't seem as tender as I would like it.  And the portions were very very small.  The presentation/dishes were very nice, but the food quality just isn't there.  If you like strong broth flavors, then you can try this place.  But honestly, as far as Hot Pot goes, this place is very expensive with very little portions.  For the price we paid, we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse for a prime rib.  The food provided is about average as well.  If you can't travel to California and you have a craving Hot Pot, then I guess this is the only alternative.  But it may be better and cheaper if you just set it up at home.
0	xlPFRbHDtL0Tq3amgJqDw	Alright, I had to try the "Chef of the Century's" restaurant. Fortunate for us, it was Restaurant Week and they had a pre-fixed menu for $50 a person. The dishes was spot-on delicious and service was impeccable. But I have to agree with the last yelper's review that you can get this type of food in SF. Perhaps if we ordered more dishes, I would be more enthusiastic with this review.  I'm not sold on this counter-style eating. It's suppose to be more modern and interactive.  If I'm going to spend a good amount of money, I don't want to talk my neighbors or accidentally bump into his elbows. I felt sorry for the waiters, they had to reach over the counters to give us the food. Not very ergonomic.
0	m8zlVFRpPiMEiuUW7XqP1g	Great experience, except for the outrageously RUDE waitstaff.  i met some friends at Lustre Bar last night before a concert. I had been there once before & liked the location & ambience. It was around 7:00 pm & it was the perfect temperature for a drink on the rooftop. We ordered a couple of appetizers which were delicious, though we had to wait almost half an hour for them to arrive.  I definitely would have given the place at least 4 stars except we got the grouchiest server in the world! Just having a bad day was no excuse for her totally uncalled for rude behavior. I hope management reads this review, because unless they get rid of this employee they will lose a lot of customers. She never smiled, rarely spoke & was really abrupt. Everyone at the table immediately noticed her rudeness. At the end she plunked the check down at the table and stalked off without one word. Hey, is it too hard to say "thanks"?
0	eol3ghWzC2dxMDp9CXw7dQ	As study-binge food goes, DP Dough is a good choice. No pizza, but their calzones are just as good and they have a huge variety of options. Their wings are baked instead of fried, which means its a slightly less guilty treat and they are actually quite delicious.   The surprise here? Their fresh-baked cookies are actually better than the better-known Insomnia Cookies. Big and chewy, they make a great dessert after you binge on wings and calzones.
0	R1j8ytwdaggLgHw5tKcbWQ	I've eaten in once and gotten delivery once from Thai Pod and both times the service, or rather severe lack thereof let this place down.  The food, to their credit, was fabulous, but waiting over an hour (both sitting in & delivery) for it to arrive really just isn't good enough. And yes, we waited over an hour for our STARTERS when we sat in.... which meant the entire dining experience took about 3 hours from start to finish.... Thanks but no thanks to dining here again.
0	xpMNvh9IfxefKH4vPadpgQ	We have been coming to Gilbert's restaurants since back in 2008 when he had Tres Banderas.  The food and service has always been good but today the food was a disappointment.  It was apparent that the cooks had mixed leftover spaghetti sauce in with the salsa and the result was neither Mexican or Italian.  We saw a table of four get up and walk out as soon as they tasted it.  This is a poor way to save leftovers.
0	9e6B9k4gbIvfTaSxOLjoHQ	Ate here twice in a week, once for breakfast, and once for lunch. The service both times was very poor. The food was mediocre at best.   Breakfast - omelet was good, but the sides were not very good. Lunch - Turkey club was not very good, the turkey was from a package.   Overall nothing was very good.
0	RyjQ1JnMhmW0g9HSswN0yg	Never again. This was a one time thing. Let me first start by saying the service was great, not flawless as we had to ask for drinks a couple of times before a refill arrived, but the staff was professional and nice. On the flip side of things their burgers were nothing special. I honestly would rather eat at McDonalds over this place. I had the Blu Burger and I was not impressed. Their beer selection is good and their French fry selection was decent too. I would only recommend going here if you are looking to eat quick (because the place is EMPTY) and are craving beer and fries.
0	8baqfLqHlUCkxA7oXChCg	A veritable meatfest.   Festival of meat.    Meat parade.  A parade of meat.   Atmosphere is a little too bright for my taste but they don't mess around at Samba.  It's fast and to the point.  Make sure you double check your reservations because if there does happen to be a mistake YOU suffer the consequences.  Wah...no sweet meats for dessert. The creme brule is a tiny island in a sea of meat equipped with it's own edible cookie palm tree and fruit floaties.
0	PS1KIPCuWuXEVdkW6iDR3g	Third strike! You're OUT! Don't allow someone to add items to the sandwich online if nobody cares enough to actually do it. Add onion and cut in half. I know... I know... why bother. Good thing I only had to wait 30-40 minutes (twice now in three days) for delivery.  Seems like the sandwich makers are freaky fast (not reading orders) and delivery.... well not so much.
0	xdKI3dHnbjecdmkQKdQX8g	This place is pretty solid.     Do you remember the old TV show "Alice"?   If you do, you are an old fart like me, but that's another subject.   For some reason this place reminded me of Mel's Diner - except the food was good!     We were there on a late Saturday morning and they sat us without any wait.   The place is diner for the local folks and I like that.   It's the kind of place where the waitresses work there forever - keep your coffee cup full and will call you "Hon".   My wife and I ordered up a good old fashion breakfast, nothing too fancy, eggs, bacon, waffle, etc.    Even though the place was pretty full, our food came out pretty quickly and it was tasty.    As I munched on my eggs and waffle, I thought to myself this is a great place to have a "recovery breakfast".    Yes - you know what I'm talking about.     The price was reasonable and I thought it was a great value.   What I really liked about this place is that it was a nice, simple, well cooked meal.     Will I be back?  Heck yes I will.
0	aN03KRs2j0hGV5NeTLy31Q	Here's the thing about Silver Mine Subs.  The delivery is so fast it will make your head spin.  Like, crazy fast.  Fast enough that you maybe are still hanging up the phone and suddenly there's a man at your door handing you a delicious sandwich.  Also, it's cheap. Not cheap like, "I'm going to question the quality of this..." but cheap like, "Hey,$7.50 for a sandwich, chips, pickle, drink and a cookie? That sounds awesome!"  Sure, Jimmy John's has that certain je ne sais quois, but their delivery range is not nearly so vast.  Neither is their menu.
0	XLoWyJF9icU06klYlEwaQ	Take everything you know about fleur de lys in SF and toss it out.  it's been vegas-ized here and everything from the decor, menu, service uniforms are completely different from the SF location.  The space is very plush.  There are 30 foot drapes and super-high ceilings and makes you feel like you're in a different world.  The menu is very modern, from sweetbreads to a bone-in ribeye.  I think it's great that the restaurant adjusted themselves to the location and are doing something new.  I had the 4 course menu.  Started with a tuna tartar which was good.  the fish was fresh and didn't have a lingering after taste.  Second course was the quail egg with sweetbreads which were interesting.  It was my first time trying sweetbreads, and while i probably wouldn't order it again, it was ok. Next came the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly and with a nice wine reduction.Finally the desert.  I couldn't actually tell what flavored ice cream it was.  It kinda tasted like a papaya/peach and was overall good.  The service and ambiance was good and so was the food.  Great place to try if you want a nice romantic dinner.  There's so many great places to eat in Vegas and this is definitely on the list.
0	4KOsSg8mAqaCfOx9DAuTCA	Whether you are at City Walk, Brea shopping plaza, or any other city with Buca, its the same food, just different state. Same Birthday song, same drinks. Difference, it's at the Excalibur in Fabulous Las Vegas! So if you like the same cheesy garlic bread, the same pasta and chicken, then albiet, you'll love this place.  Service was good, especially for the party size we had.  Oh, no walk through the kitchen?! No Kitchen table, and No different rooms. I was so hoping to get the Pope's table. Oh well...
0	GSHO1OxQYweQogT339MPw	This is an oldie and a goodie! Here they celebrate the cuisine of northern Italy - Salut!! Apart from being very dark inside - it didnt really help that the menu was completely in Italian (I love this though....) but it had the translations underneath in even smaller script - GREAT - I will just have one of everything!! The cuisine was traditional in the 'hunter-style' rich sauces and meats - YUM. Service was great -and wine selection even better. I try not to frequent too many Italian restaurants (on purpose!) but this one is always on my list.
0	8u90x5DsILAz7sqK3eAaaA	As far as the food selection goes, not many choices. This is an upscale (different) menu, not a meat & potato menu. That's ok, but I wasn't familiar with the names of the ingrediants in the entre's. Actually, there is no menu at all, it's up on the chalkboard; therefore there is not alot of room to be descriptive. Do I have to ask to have each dinner explained to me? This place needs a menu that you can hold in your hand & read, and a lot better decriptions of what the dinners consist of. I had a steak over top of some white fries. It was ok, it's the only thing on the menu that I was familiar with so thats why I ordered it. Eating out shouldn't be a P-I-A like this. If they ever get a better menu, I'll come back, but not 'till then.
0	Rd3RmLBeqm36HEX7rwe9kQ	i had a high expectation for this place, but yet i was let down. i placed an order over the phone, ordered the 6 piece chicken. ended up being around $10. and once you'll sit down and open up that box, you'll be in a world of shock! they got wings so small that you're mother wouldn't believe her eyes! the cashier (she's the owner, i'm predicting.) i couldn't believe she hid her baby under the register! my lady and I was trying to enjoy our chicken, then all the sudden. we heard a baby crying! upon observation, it was coming from under the register...yes, believe it. a chicken shack turned into daycare service. and the funny part, as we're eating. the chef walks out and calls me a fool( i'm sure he calls everyone a fool, whoever he sees) like get with the program, if you're representing an establishment you gotta be professional! and not insult a customer. the verdict, sad to say. i've experience better chicken, popeyes is still the best.
0	2VrxKddV2vvJGCsNtDqv6Q	I am reading some of the other reviews....not so much.  We had the Green Curry Thai with shrimp, medium spice.  The flavors were ok, albeit a bit too hot for my other half.  The pot stickers, at 1.00 each....not close to being worth it.  I will probably not be going back....I am sure there are other Thai places in the Vegas area worth my while.
0	B6IX3RGRemHy1eVxwxDXQ	A few friends and I visited this place a few weeks ago.  We reserved a table for 6 for 8pm.  We weren't seated until 9pm.  On top of that, the hostess had an attitude when I asked her why it was taking so long.  If they couldnt accommodate us at 8pm then they should've just said so.  Then while we were eating, it took the waiter a while to get our drink orders and food orders.  Although I got the Rodizio, I was a bit disappointed in the amount of time it took them to bring the meats to our table.  All in all, the food and service was not that great. And my friend was saying how their Capirinhas were not good either.  Those are the most popular Brazilian drinks, and yet somehow they were not tasteful.  We even complained to the owner and instead of giving us free desserts or apologizing, he changed the subject and talked about how his "online reviews" were excellent.  Seriously?  Needless to say, later that evening me and one of my friends got extremely sick and threw up.  It's a shame because when we first visited back when they opened the food was great, excellent service and overall great experience.  It's too bad that their quality and service has gone downhill.  Never going there again.

It's not so awesome anymore. I had the fries recently and they kind sucked, I was super disappointed. It was too cheesy, the dressing that it comes with didn't have the flavor it had. The fries left me feeling wanting. And to think, I used a cheat day on those fries makes me feel worse lol.

0	nRFWX3fQokvNUaOd2vhXIQ	Went through the drive-thru for breakfast this morning.  6-5-15 8:30 am   I had a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit combo w/ coffee.    Biscuit & tater tots were awesome!!!   I asked for four creams and two splendas in my coffee and received maybe one of each.  The coffee was terrible. It's right up there with the coffee you get in the waiting room at a service station.  Blech.  I wish they would have at least put the cream and splenda in there to cover up the nasty taste.
0	hNz8F5nT6xoxArv3jlq3Kg	They can have some great pizza,  depends on the day.  Most the time it's on the money.  Turkey sub is awesome.  Finally,  I like chicken wings,  and have some crispy wings. Add a little blue cheese,  and a garlic knot and your in the bees knees!
0	QiR9Ums3fmSx7Ch0KKzHmA	It is so nice in the hustle and bustle of Vegas to be able to walk up to a counter, pay a relatively inexpensive price (for Vegas standards) for some grub and receive the food within five minutes.  On top of that, these crepes are delish!      What my hubby and I have done is order one salty and one sweet crepe and split them.  I believe they refer to them as meal or dessert crepes...just get one of each.  They are huge but you need to try more than one of these fairly inventive recipes.  I have not made it here on my last two trips to Vegas but Yelp just reminded me to go back and grub.
0	Owe0PRrqqOuCrKYunDWwTw	We always see this place as we go into Super Walmart to shop and its always busy. So we decided to try them out after we shopped. Bad!! The floors were dirty, the customer service was nothing to talk about and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long while. FYI just because they are always busy doesn't mean they are good. McDonalds of all places!!!!
0	gWky2OrYSLrESTTZWb1VQ	We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.  The burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.  The service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit.
0	rObFTr7H44hbDMZCDiMTg	Thank goodness for Piccadilly pizza. As drunk as I tend to get on Fremont, this place is a welcome haven for us idiots. It's remarkably clean. For the amount of business it does. The pizza is hot and ready fast. The employees are courteous.  The historic casino photos make for something interesting to look at while you regain your senses.
0	dyIsaV5nTuB4J5qciDMriw	Venezia's is great! I finally got a chance to try them the other day. My husband and I both went for our "date night." We both got one of their combinations, with a slice of pizza, six wings and a drink. Their slices are HUGE! It was a very yummy meal for both of us.  My only comment is that the restaurant is a little dark. I would have liked more lighting. It could have just been the cloud coverage. But I will definitely be back! Good stuff!
0	Prq90rYGr6rSdrWiFPx9g	My narrow scope of Vietnamese food was limited to various bowls of pho or rice plates.  Thanks to a friend and Bamboo Bistro, my appreciation for Vietnamese cuisine has greatly expanded. On the first day of the New Year, my taste buds were treated to a seven course meal consisting of four beef plates.  Started off with a beef salad with Julian slices of celery, mint, carrots, and daikon.  The textures and flavors were uniquely refreshing.  I can get use to this kind of salad.  The next dish was a chicken and squid combination with a curry pancake thing on top, and the third was a honey glazed quail.  Tasty.  The next three courses were a variation of beef: grilled beef, meatloaf, and paper thin slices of beef in vinegar.  Mmmmm . . . meat.  The final course was a hearty soup with rice and ground beef.  It was the kind of soup that makes you feel good on a cold day when you're not feeling too good.  It was a great way to end the meal.  The food was filling without feeling stuffed, and I'm thankful for the experience.  Overall, Bamboo Bistro is the first Vietnamese restaurant with a nice sit down feel and will having me returning for more.
0	v4EQ3VN9Dwrz2LazgXqsQ	i like this place a lot. it reminds of king's island in ohio if that means anything to anyone.  the location and rooms are perfect for the price.  and the casino is cheap and easy.  the free drinks floweth and you never feel scowled at when returning to your room at 5am, drunk and penniless.
0	9MgErHvxSK7d04L9b6erg	Went Thursday night for a late dinner with my husband.  This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting.  This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything. OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant.  It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud.  I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch.  Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained.   onto the food.  we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing.  this was good.  definitely fresh.  then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok.  very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything.  the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that.  then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe.  the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos.  i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee.  Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness.  But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars.  Would i go back?  No.  Should you try it?  Yes.  There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.
0	8dAAksK8KlOKokQeda1A	I have to say that I've had high-hopes for this place since seeing that they were going to be opening in this location.  It is very near my office and their menu fare would be a welcome addition in the area.  Alas, now that they are open and I have sampled their food, I am pretty unimpressed.  For the TL;DR crowd.  Me: Meatball hoagie on french bread add caramelized onions; jasmine iced tea Friend: Steak and cheese calzone; iced black tea To Go: Half-order of garlic/parm pretzels  Gist: Hoagie was okay, but they forgot the onions; the calzone looked to have a LOT of green peppers in it; the tea was clear but bitter and acidic. The soft-pretzels, which I was REALLY looking forward to, turned out to be doughy balls of bland.  :(  This may just be me -- but I'd think that as a new establishment (they've only been open a few days) that they would take some time to introduce the menu a bit.  That aside, there was also some obvious disarray.    - forgot the onion addition to my hoagie - when I checked with the server to make sure we didn't get charged for the onion addition, she thought I meant the entire sandwich - a manager of sorts came to the table to apologize (props), but he seemed VERY uncomfortable doing so - same manager returned a second time to let me know he was comp'ing the cost of the pretzels because of "having those onions that I didn't care for" (??? - FOCUS!)  Oh, and they delivered a pizza to our table at one point as we were finishing, which belonged to another table near us.  I suppose the confusion can be expected to some degree since they just opened, so I won't hold this against them too much.  I'm not sure where they got their recipe for soft pretzels, but they really are kind of meh.  Doughy and flavorless.  When I think of "soft pretzels" I think of the kind that are thick and have a bit of a "crust" on the outside, but are soft and spongy inside (with lots of little air pockets).    Anyway, I'll probably do another review once I try their pizza and their salads.  I'm hoping the salad will be their saving grace as, surprisingly, there aren't any options in the way of a good, healthy salad and soup bar on Mill avenue.
0	nWuuxyUHqCmbnatKXYLTw	I love it here. Great place to go if you want to be fancy. Not the finest food in the world, but the view is unique to Vegas. The service is great, it should be, it's pricey enough for the okay food. Still gets 4 stars though. It's a great experience. Ride the rollercoaster at the top of the casino afterwards!
0	SJXcDUAcUDBcOJ2g1cDLg	So far this is probably the best chinese take-out place I've found in the area. You get TONS of food & rice for the money (hint: If getting food for yourself only, get a small). I've had their General Tso's, Teriyaki, and Lemon Chicken dishes so far and have enjoyed all of them. Prices are great as well.  The gal at the front desk is funny. Seems like she's always in a rush, but is perfectly nice. I like people who have a sense of urgency, so I really don't mind at all. It's nice that she always overestimates the amount of time it'll take to finish your meal so you're never disappointed.  Not quite five star flavor, but you wouldn't expect that from this type of establishment either. Still I think you get more than what you pay for.
0	93v9kBzq5lO9XKUtBIoNA	4-stars for value.  Great place to fill up on cheap, tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket.  Menu offers: - European sandwiches - Asian sandwiches - Gourmet coffee - Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas - Housemade ice cream  We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.    Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.  Our standard picks are:  #1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20 - ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate - great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)  # 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20 - Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill  Cafe Sua Da $2.20  - Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice - Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream - As much caffeine as a quadruple shot  Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.  Remember cash only.
0	cMRQwO8DtKD66ivxxUXCsA	Very slow during lunch.  Guy put on the wrong sauce (should've been peppercorn) which essentially, ruined my sub.  I normally would've taken it back, but the line was so long, I didn't wanna screw over anyone else's lunch. Their toaster needs re-calibrated as our sammiches weren't very "toasty."  Weak.  Go to Jersey Mikes instead.
0	BAXPLaPk4QFNXAfQnZ8FUA	Not really sure on how to best describe this restaurant. It's very basic, nothing unique about it if you would compare it to other Italian restaurants. The services was great (basically the majority of the rating was because of the service). The man who served us was very kind and generous and couldn't have done a better job.  Food :- A friend had ordered for me as I was getting ready in the hotel room so by the time I arrived it was slightly cold, the waiter offered to heat it up for me, which he did. Upon tasting the food the mushrooms were slightly burnt - the chicken was fine and nothing special. The potatoes tasted as if someone had thrown a heap of salt on them which wasn't that good.  Quite hard to judge this restaurant as I was pretty jet lagged and very hungry!! So I will probably give it another chance before I leave.
0	MM5rVePQj42iNbTWLR0zfA	This is a great sushi place - in the Treasure Island hotel. Typical Vegas atmosphere with beautiful scantily clad servers, house music, dark lighting and a very cool vibe - it reminded me a bit of Tao - but I actually liked it better. They've got yummy lychee martinis and some really great rolls. Had the edamame too. I eat sushi all the time, and the funniest thing about this place was the fact that they had a $30 roll...that's Vegas for ya. Anyways, it was definitely great food and a cool atmosphere- I'll be back again.
0	8ayZcxArZzkZw7gID5vPLg	I have some buddies that came up this weekend to celebrate ST. PATRICK'S DAY.  So where better to have a St. Paddy's day then Roberto's Taco Shop?  I told them that for Cinco de Mayo they will come back for a trip to a British Pub to have a pint of Guinness.  Anyhow, here is my review:  We checked out the menu that was here on Yelp!  and decided what we wanted before we came.  So, that's a bonus.  I ended up getting the 2 taco combo meal and a bean and cheese burrito.  I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the burrito was great.  A couple of my friends had the same thing and another had a torta.  She raved about it.  So, next time I go that will be the move I make.  We got our meals to go and they gave us all of the sides we needed.    So, it was a 4 star experience and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home.
0	rcuDekJTwMp4nlfsFDA9GQ	I went for lunch and it was unimpressive. One patty is thinner than a Burger King patty. It could've have been any kind of meat because I couldn't taste it at all. It was expensive for a lunch. I had the weekly special burger, fries, and a soda $13.45 without tip. I sat at the bar and dealt with the bartender yelling "Peanuts"  the whole time. Fries were nothing special, typical Sysco fries. save your money and go to the Tipsy  Cow or The Weary Traveler for much better burgers.
0	cvvQdl0WDoxMSQE7kltGUw	Wow!  Glad to see the good reviews, I made my maiden voyage in March '07 and thought it was fantastic, but I was DDDDDD-runk.  Made a follow-up visit in December '07 and was happy to find the food to be just as good when sober.  Delicious food and cool atmosphere, although  I could do without the Carlos Santana blaring at 90 decibels.  I like my Carlos as much as the next guy, but it was a bit much.   I've tried both Mexican and Cuban entrees, and you really can't go wrong with either.  Inexpensive, tasty food.  Great service.  An economically diverse clientele.  What more could one ask for?  Mr. Santana takes it down from 5 stars to 4.4 stars for me.  Don't walk any further east, it's kind of dangerous, especially at night.  But Mamacita's is a must if you're hungry and on Fremont - it's a required stop for me on future visits.  --------------------------------  Update:  March 2008  They've turned down the music.  Thank you, God.  I enjoyed the same Carlos Santana videos, but at about 50% of the volume of my previous visits.  Food is still very good!
0	wt1frpFE1d0QVAo4tbI8uw	Over recent years,  I've had good luck with the Longhorn chain. Not so, of late. When traveling frequently, it's a comfort to know some restaurants will be, day in and day out, a place to get a good meal. Longhorn is becoming more and more hit and miss. This was a miss. I had only 45 minutes for a mid-afternoon lunch. Although service was attentive and friendly, the steak was 50% tough or just plain gristle. The waitress offered a replacement, but I'd run out of time. Fortunately, I'd eaten enough of the excellent rolls and iceberg lettuce salad to hold me until supper.
0	TRmwRYrylnwcwAbDHqHsPQ	This place is gloriousness on a plate, and a coffee cup.  I stumbled on Lazy Jane's one summer biking around the lake and now come back everytime I am in town. Everyone here is amazingly friendly, always offering free food to first time customers.  I havent ever had anything besides the egg and vegetable omelette because I dont want to mess with a good thing, but friends have raved about the homemade granola and other bakery items.  This place is always really busy and there isnt a lot of seating, so you will need to wait on the weekend, but while you are, you can look at the art from local artists that is displayed and for sale and wait for your name to be screamed in a welcoming way by the cook knowing that your food is ready. This place is good stuff!
0	BZNH4tVNJlYpklREbJoNg	Review for the weekend buffet only.  This place is friggin expensive for sure.  I would never do a proper meal here cuz the price scares me so much.  However..the weekend buffet is pretty good. Although the selections aren't as deep as Tamba or Gandhi, the quality of the food definitely makes up for it.  White meat chicken...can you believe it??
0	ZVSERKyq1cb1jCBJ8Y6rUA	The Vig is a beautiful bar with good food (as far as bar food goes).  I don't get caught up in the Scottsdale plastics or snobby labels that people love to stamp on others.  It has a great ambience no matter what part of town it is in.  The patio is breathtaking and yes I will return.
0	KCEiAxRvSEJPE0a2Y0WnEw	We went to try this new place ...its close to home and I like to support the mom and pops rather than the chains.  It was disappointing.  The prices are, well, high....higher than the Italian chain....  and for that we got little thin slices of warm bread and no salad or soup.  just the entree.  They give you plenty of the main course, but the sauce was blah.....  where was the garlic?  where was the seasonings?   I had chicken parm.   It was a hunk of overcooked chicken breast.  there was only once choice of pasta....  linguini or linguini.   My husband had the baked ziti.  it was blah too.    the service was fine.  I know its new and I hope they make it.
0	JajaX2hajusm3sNsYbHJWg	This is a great place to go if you wanna get away from overpriced strip food for some cheap Chinese food.  My Favs are House special fried fish  French style filet mignon Beef with Chinese brocolli Salt pepper fried pork chop Fried squid.
0	Im82II9j35WyEwCYqmSeUg	Food is okay but nothing special, the service is slow and when I tried to order a take out order with my groupon when I got in they slapped on extra fees when I got there before they would give me my food. I have eaten there once for take out and once eating in. The atmosphere is dirty and has the feeling that it needs a good cleaning but nobody wants to do it.
0	kYkOfBueK5mKXBB2WOjY1A	201108130930  Looking over the menu this morning, 5th Ave. is very competitive in their price points.  The usual restaurant items, some 5th Ave. special items, several veggie choices.    Let's compare a National Chain 1.8 mi (2.9 K) west.  1. 5th Ave. -6:30 AM - 2 PM NC - 24/7   2. 5th Ave - unique Jazz/Blues theme decor NC - modified cookie cutter decor  3. 5th Ave - Normal plus 5th Ave choices on menu NC - You always know what you'll get, one dish an internationally famous caloric/fat content item.  4. 5th Ave. - News on TV at low volume NC - Unavoidably loud 10 minutes endless loop, sometimes running 7 months 24/7 noting extremely cool items like new talent, hot sports events, and great new menu items.  5. 5th Ave - local artists work sometimes showcased. Sometimes local music events. NC - Finally got some Arizona landscape pictures on the wall during the recent remodel.  We could go another .7 miles ( 1.12 K) east from 5th Ave to another NC, drop the mega cal menu item, throw out items 4 & 5 completely.  We have another comparison.  BTW, 5th Ave has a full-service bar.  I have a road to hit.  Smoochy smoochy Sweet D.
0	zzLV0WPS4wWP9aZQxIAuIw	Meh. I've experienced better.  Good and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.  First go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, "meh."  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.  Second go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.  A special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.  An all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent.
0	VIjj3PEjQVe50ec7E0DQ	They have always struggled with service, but at least the food is consistent. Even the employees who give good service will openly tell you they are wanting to leave. Not sure what the issue is, but it's a bummer to visit this place. Always.
0	GzQ98Wfy3dKRzDevpgAJw	I've been here for lunch 3 times, and have only had one good dining experience. The first time I ate here was when they first opened, and although they told us they were out of many items, what we ended up ordering was pretty good.   The second time I went was for takeout a couple of weeks later. I ordered a burger, which was supposed to come with "rosemary potato crisps". When I got back to the office, the burger (which I ordered medium) was extremely rare, and had some sort of sweet condiment on it. Rather than fries or "Rosemary potato crisps", it had been served with what looked like a handful of crushed corn chips. Meh For $12, I felt cheated.  Looks like they had a falling out with their chef, because they took his sign down, and put up a sign for a different Italian chef. OK I'll give the new guys a try. Well, I would have. When I walked in, they apologized, but the cook had just stormed out, and they didn't have anyone working in the kitchen, so couldn't serve me any food.   The bar itself has really nice decor, nice bartenders, a couple of pool tables, etc. It would probably be good for a game of pool or a drink, but don't plan on ordering any food.
0	Fyh1EDOD0QQKR9jEvJBhw	Unfortunetly a fail. A cute restaurant on Saint Paul but the mood was mediocre if not bad. Me and my friend had a pretty good meatball appetizer but the duck and mushroom pasta was awful. Tasteless- the mushrooms were gross and the duck was hard. The staff was delightful though and a big help when looking for a place for me and my girl friend to go to. Otherwise avoid this place if your a foody
0	wLfkzkW7SxANQmr6DJoCQ	This little hole in the wall is a gem, although it looks more like plain old rock from the outside.  Don't let the looks fool you.  Took the better half to dinner here last week and she was a bit apprehensive from the start.  Small parking lot, not much to look at on the outside, and really not too much on the inside either.  But the food changes everything.  I had the molcajete, which had beef, chicken, chorizo, some cotija cheese and a nopale.  It came out piping hot in a big bowl with beans and guacamole on the side.  Fantastic.  Even better were the made-in-house corn tortillas served with it.  Just take a little bit of everything and wrap it in one of those fantastic tortillas and your taste buds will thank you.  My girlfriend had the fajitas and from what I tried, they were fantastic as well.   When she couldn't finish hers and we had it wrapped for home, they threw in some extra homemade corn tortillas.  Great place if you are ever on that side of town.  Good food and friendly service.  We will be back.
0	jNkRqNTS52U7vRwNIFGEPw	I just don't know how this place is still in existence, the bagels are the worst, plain and simple.  I tried several different bagels and they're just not good and the spreads aren't much better.  I only come over when I come across a coupon and it's not even worth the time then.........

It is the perfect place to go for a chill fast casual meal... It's by far the best fast casual mexican concept around - extremely fresh, clean, friendly, and cheap!  Their chips and salsa are tasty and you don't get so many that you feel sick afterwards.  Also, their salsa selection (3 different kinds) is great whether you are lookiing for spicy or mild... Moe's started in Atlanta so I was familiar with it from when I lived there... I am so excited that they are expanding in AZ!  Moe's is great for families, athletes, health-conscious, or not so health-conscious.  There is something for everyone at Moe's!
0	zMRbzhNLgYnmoh0lTmzU2g	best delivery pizza you can get in madison - i LOVE the ranch pizza with bacon and chicken.  but it is a splurge...not your $5 papa johns deal.  definitely worth it if you're in the mood for great pizza.
0	3uNEYbaRUYpYLzIK8oQ	Re-visited Brother's Pizza Sunday night.  Got there very near closing.  They were as warm and friendly as before.  DH got a pepperoni pizza and I tried the Eggplant dinner.  Same fresh, crisp, unimaginative salad with house Italian dressing.  Eggplant was good----generous slices of eggplat properly fried, but a bit soggy after having been baked in sauce.  If I knew them better, I would tell them that they should reheat eggplant and sauce separately---eggplant on grill or salamander---then put together for serving.  That's how you keep the crispy fried goodness.  Maybe I can tell them in a year or so, lol!  The mozarella they use is soooo good!  But all in all, it was another really tasty meal---I actually ate a slice of DH's pizza!    And bless their hearts---I bet we walked in just as they were closing, because the minute we walked out, the lights went off----they didn't even clear our table!  Yet they never once made us feel like an inconvenience.  Sorry guys!  We'll try to come earlier next time!  :)
0	Ou64fUOno7WAjaqMLBWw8Q	Ticoz is another Tom Jetland operation, and he did a very nice job with this one too. I love how his three restaurants (Fez, Ticoz, Switch) have a similar trendiness and quality, yet totally different personalities. Kudos to him for that. Unlike Fez, where you can order anything at all from the menu, at Ticoz there are certain dishes which are good and certain dishes which stand out. But nothing I've tried has been bad, just so-so on a few occasions. The waffle fries are excellent... the tamales are really nice... and the curry rice dish is quite savory. I love the vibe, it's so mellow and laid-back yet trendy and hip. A hard balance to manage, and in Phoenix it's really rare...
0	8lhJ6Kd0DCnTIgRAxKtWqg	Ordered a couple of breakfast burritos. Not too bad, a little dry, too much potatoes, had better. The hot sauce was decent and pricing on par. However, what put me off big-time was the obvious pro illegal immigration, anti Border Patrol posters. You wanna have your political opinion? Great, but it doesn't belong in a restaurant. I'll take my $ elsewhere where they respect the laws of our country.
0	HfBTFOmLF1q8xJxaWQTtw	Just see my review for The Cheesecake Factory, they have the same owner. That was easy. \r However, I'm giving this restaurant a higher rating because:\r A- It's in the Venetian\r B- Open 24 hours\r C- Slightly better food\r D- Thee best hot chocolate, especially yummy at 4am
0	oraE9SJt9p8DQdRDqphYfQ	I am craving this place right now.  Last time I went, I had the Fettuccine Alfredo.  I liked it a lot -- I get alfredo at lots of places and this one was really good.  However, believe it or not, the entree was not my favorite part of the meal -- it was the yummmmy garlic knots.  They are complimentary with your meal.  I definitely would come back based on just the garlic knots!
0	U94OFZucezEqwzVKyt1uow	All you can eat - just keep ordering off the menu. The rolls are great and the uni was excellent. The sushi was not as great as my favorite place but it was just as good as most sushi places, and the soft shell crab was top notch. But in particular, they do a top qualify shrimp tempura. Service was extremely friendly and they didn't mind that the kids made a huge mess (and they ate a lot which doesn't always happen)  Much better than some of the big hotel buffets we went to.
0	CxNsvyRAFnMKH815gDN3Q	My friend and I stopped in here on a fluke; we wanted to eat somewhere we hadn't before and we usually tend to go for Italian anytime, anywhere. We came upon Carmine's and decided to go in.  It was kind of a mess from the start. The boss's daughter (who looked to be about 8 or 9 years old and was wearing a Justin Bieber t-shirt) got our drink orders. That struck both of us in an odd and uncomfortable way, you know, with child labor laws and all.  My friend ordered a water and it came with a lemon in it; he told them could he have a water without lemon in it and the girl just took it back, took the lemon out, and served it right back to him. Come on, we're not stupid, we can taste if there's been a lemon in the water.  The plain cheese pizza we ordered took a good 20 minutes to come out to us, and I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty "meh". The cheese was falling off in clumps. We only ordered the cheese pizza 'cause the prices were definitely outrageous. The 18" pizza we got was $14. We definitely wanted toppings and all but each additional topping was $2...so cheese pizza it was.  Service was kind of slow, which is bad, considering there were only 3 other people in the restaurant.  I wouldn't exactly recommend this place to anyone; Carmine's Little Italy on the West side of town has a better atmosphere and better service (the prices are somewhat similar, however).
0	0dNdpg3msIGfDNkg9RbJQ	Stopped in for a immune blast smoothie around 12:30PM and the place was empty.  I like that they will deliver the smoothie to you personally.  When I went on my way with my smoothie in hand to do some major errands before the holidays  I could not even suck out of the straw. the smoothie.  I was very frustrated.  I had to actually use a spoon once I got home to eat my smoothie.
0	I85wTTk2L75euiYUvYDw	a great break from what is the STRIP, after filling up on caffeine at Coca-Cola World & M&M world next door-I grab the $20 card and head straight for the newest games. This place has the best arcade setup-shooting games,racing games,carnival games, then a pool hall and excellent grill plus the bar for adults. They even have live concerts and gaming competitions occasionally.
0	5gqMsnTt0ldsjfTg2aE1wA	I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.  Anyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.  My one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it.
0	i7VlVx51J3DfUeGwLXEWVA	4 stars for Pittsburgh.  Competent service, good drinks.  I don't love the theme-ed-ness or, for that matter, the food.  But they have lots of great specials and the California salad with lime cilantro dressing is one of the best salads in the 'Burgh.    If you don't like the noise, go for lunch, especially a weekend lunch or early dinner.  Other locations are fine too.  FYI, vegetarians, the dressing has cheese in it.  And it's so good, I bet it's actually real parmigiano reggiano, too, or close to it.
0	sjYKeaqd4axMaL5S0A6jIA	These type of taquerias are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas, but I wanted to stray away from my usual places to try something different.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the jewel I was expecting.  The carne asada nachos were "over the top," but the grease under the chips was ridiculous.  Not that I was expecting healthy fare, but it would have been nice to have had the chips patted down a little bit.  Had to rely on my table top for that task.  Gross.
0	cyXHMkLblDJTStbXvYQCTQ	I hope these guys do well. I'd love to have a Japanese restaurant closer to work but, the competition around S. Tryon @ Shopton Rd is too stiff. Some changes to the menu will be required.   At the moment the menu only has hibachi grill style items and a total of three sushi items. The current promotion is buy-one-get-one free meaning we spent $6 a piece. Not bad when discounted but, not good at the regular price. I'd rather go down the street to Fortune Cookie II.  It's a great idea with some potential but, with the current menu and prices, I'm sad to say Pika Japanese won't be around too long.
0	RIKMAFwxFrklH5Bu4lx7g	So either you like Taco Bell or you are a communist, so I won't waste any of this review trying to explain to you how awesome beefy 5 layer burritos are, I will just talk about this location.  Pros - its basically always empty around 4th meal time so you never have to wait in line -the staff seems to get only medium high while at work, compared to most taco bells where they get Greatful Dead concert level high- this results in a lot less screw ups in your order- yay for moderation.  -the food comes out warm- not hot like a real big boy restaurant- but not the cold gross beans you get at many taco bells after 11 when they have long since stopped caring  Cons -it is like a 2 minute drive further away than 2 other taco bells and my time is valuable- those Hello Ladies reruns aren't going to watch themselves -I love Mountain Dew, mainly because I'm an extreme sports athlete- however I HATE baja blast. The Mountain Dew at this location always tastes a little Baja Blasty which sucks
0	whilCoFKCJfOMPMAXS3Q	I wanted to love Windsor because we love Postino. But, there's a different vibe even though it's right across the street.  Service is more flippant and dismissive, the seating options are either too sunny (and hot) outside or too dark (and freezing) inside.  blueberry lemonade is a great concept, but strain the blueberry skins out....nothing like a straw-full to keep you from enjoying your drink. loaded chip app with caramelized onions, bacon and blue cheese could have been amazing, if chips weren't greasy and overdone. the pastrami reuben was good (wet, but good) but not anything out of the ordinary.  chicken salad sandwich was a unique mix of chicken, avocado, nuts and sundried tomatoes but it just seemed like it was trying to hard.  odd service...went from friendly waitress to unfriendly waitress to other food and drink deliverers who had no idea who ordered what.
0	4L6x3OCh4cBWNgvIDm3p6w	Los Favoritos makes the best breakfast burritos that I have tasted so far!!! I get the egg, potato, and cheese burrito. The eggs are fluffy, the cheese plentiful, and the potatoes are FRENCH FRIES! If thats not love, I dont know what is. Haha. I love mixing their green and red sauces on my burrito to make a christmas sauce. Their burritos are not huge but a pretty good size and a pretty cheap breakfast when you compare to how much you would pay to get full at McDonalds or Wendy's. The only issue I have is that they don't speak much english there. Other than that, the breakfast burro with no meat is great and the atmosphere, although a little plain, is clean which is one of my biggest fears in little taco shops like this. I have been to some Filibertos that I felt were not very clean and honestly was a little skeptical to even try Los Fav's. Now that I have, I will have to give more of these little taco's shops a try and start listening to the hub a little more!
0	mZ2jd9ZSV04nZXVgUe4AA	After eating at Jimmy John's in Chicago and Indianapolis, I was so excited they opened one here. Not just here in town, but like 15 feet from work!! It just opened this past week and I rushed over as soon as I could. I've been here twice now for lunch. The first time for a tuna sandwich the next time for the Club Lulu  The tuna was bland and I wouldn't have it again The turkey on the Lulu was nearly non existent but the sandwich was still decent. The lettuce was weird...had a weird texture, I don't quite no how to explain it.  I feel kind of let down by this Jimmy John's. Back to Gandolfo's it is! The bread was too chewy. Not quite stale
0	RdyKBUAOl0F7YwQxR5TNnQ	I don't know why no one has reviewed this place yet.  I personally think the food is not too bad but you can not understand a word of anything anyone working there is trying to say.  I'm sorry.  I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful.  I am being totally honest.  And what really gets me is that what they try to say is no where near what they are trying to say.  The woman had to actually pick up a packet of sugar and show it to the guy behind me so he could understand what she was trying to say.  It's baffling.
0	83VJJ2b7jy35CSKL84ALRQ	Quality of service has gone down lately.   Most recent visit ordered Dr Pepper and a Lemonade by when we got to the window they were out of every syrup but cherry coke and tea.   Food took a really long time and we waited at the front in a parking spot for ten minutes. The avocado salad had no avocado in it. The tacos were filled with some liquid that didn't seem to belong. The rice was chewy verging on crunchy.   The redeeming item was the stuffed quesadilla, although pricey, it was full of flavor and meat. It saved the evening and we will get it each time.   Have had a few bad experiences and long waits. Will try again soon to reevaluate.
0	V2AA8tOtiwQIclR0byoFg	Meh, I've experienced better. But here's the thing. It's in my neighborhood and it's quick Chinese. What more can I say?   I ordered the Veggie Lo Mein. The thing I loved about it, that I don't find in most, is that it was packed full of veggies. The thing I did not love was that the flavor was a little bit soy and a lot grease. Don't get me wrong, I know grease has it's place in take-out Chinese, but I'd like a little more flavor to my grease. Ya get what I'm sayin'?  If it wasn't in my hood probably wouldn't be back. Since it is, I'll see ya when I'm lazy and didn't make dinner (which probably means next week).
0	MN3dEI0UbyvrCGgSE2dN4A	I ordered a #5 "The Vito". I was impressed by the quick service however the sandwich was mediocre. The bread was kind of dry and was ripped so it fell apart a little as I was eating it. Not bad, but nothing I need to go back for anytime soon.
0	LqIN2Xcmz8mDy7Tz5uBA	There's the wholesale Fish Market that sells bulk and a couple blocks further there's the store that sells fresh seafood, grocery store of many items including produce and food vendors include a Pittsburgh BBQ,  sushi vendor and seafood counter that offers sandwiches and soup, as well as a large selection of fried seafood.  A train track above was cool bc the train is running.  The Cod sandwich was excellent, and I ordered the junior size (4 oz) and that was plenty for me for $3. , otherwise it's $5. for the regular size (that must be alot).  Also, the Boston clam chowder soup (8 oz) for $3, it was one of best I had.  Order the soup and sandwich special for $6. you get soup, sandwich and a drink. They have pkg of tarter sauce and hot sauce.  I went back another day and tried their crab cakes, but I didn't like it as much.  It was tasty, but greasy and smelled of oil.   I enjoyed the fish sandwich much better.  Crab cakes were 2 for $5.    Also, I tried the crab and lobster bisque soup and that was pretty good too!  There was bits of lobster and crab in the soup.  I prefer the clam chowder bc I love clams!  Prices were very reasonable and I would go back again.
0	3LF233I313Bg64w67P5Jg	First off, the hostesses need to appreciate the fact that the waiting ritual here is a bit unique to first timers even when you know about the wait. Our scenario:  Hostess: It'll be about 2 hours. Us: Ok, no problem. (Walk around downtown, go to Fate for appetizers, come back 2 hours later) Us: What's the ETA? Hostess: You left?! (Weird shuffling and glancing at reservation list, no feedback) Us: ...Uh yeah (thinking that it was 2 hours to kill). Hostess: Keep waiting.  Despite 3 hours, this turned out to be a good spot for entertaining my out-of-town friend (especially since she loves pizza and is highly susceptible to hype). If it's not a hot night and you have a few downtown bars in your repertoire, you can make a good time of walking, talking, and relaxing during your wait.   Personally, the pizza was too thin for my style (On one piece, it felt like my ingredients were touching me through the crust). However, my friend raved about how it was the best she'd ever had. Since I was entertaining her, I was really happy with the place. There are a lot of little quirks about Pizzeria Bianco, but there's something about the whole package that works into a really memorable experience and I think this is what the high profile reviews tap into.
0	KRp1685aR0DzPsexqTlTlw	I can't favorably review any sushi place that feels the need to add filler to spicy tuna. It just screams cheap. Not to mention it kills quite a few options for the gluten free crowd. Shame. The decor was nice,  nicer than I'd expect from a place in a strip mall.  And the wait staff was friendly. Also didn't care for them talking me out of ordering rolls with brown rice. Prefer to eat healthier whenever possible. If your sushi chefs aren't skilled enough to roll with it,  don't offer it on the menu.   Also,  if I mention I have a wheat allergy,  and I order quite a few things that have wheat to whatever degree in it  alert me before you make my order,  not after and point out I can't eat 90% of what you bring out. I purposely ordered a couple things so my date could enjoy more,  but things I've been ordering for years many other places without issue contained wheat (crunch most likely) here. Again  just seems like they're trying to go on the cheap.
0	EGDCJa44WpVo8biqpXSKNQ	I've been to a lot of buffets in Vegas and this one is by far my favorite.  I don't expect much in the quality department when I go to a buffet because let's face it, we're there for the quantity, aren't we?  I was impressed with the wide variety of food and with how good it was.  It will definitely be the one I go back to.    However, our waitress was a beeeee-atch.  She was so rude to us and literally yelled at my friend for pulling a chair up to our booth when she arrived later than the rest of us.  WTF?  She was really snotty and told my friend she couldn't sit there.  Either she had to move to a different table or squeeze in one side with two others.  I don't see what is so wrong about pulling up a chair to make a 4-person booth fit 5.  It really ticked off the waitress for some reason and consequently I had to eat my brunch squeezed in like a sardine, while one end of the table was completely empty.  Plus it took them FOREVER to get rid of our empty plates so eventually we had to pile them on the table next to us.  And they didn't fill up our waters.  Summary:  go for the food, it is great!  Just understand that the service will suck.
0	PCvaIT5vSf7Zg04d8YIw	Great restaurant.  The pizzas are good.  The sauces are above average, while the crust is average.  My kids adore the chicken fingers.  Online ordering is very surprising, coming from a little place like this.
0	NxstSHs2GJl8PG5Wli8OQ	Food was tasty.  Definitely better than many of the other reviews suggested.  I had the chicken enchilada and chili relleno combination.  2 for 1 special on the combination right now.  Great deal for dinner.
0	T09zRUbWOEmPTuBe0KC3gA	This might be the scariest long john silvers on the planet. Its right next to a sleezy check cashing place, so there are a ton of interesting people in the parking lot. The manager was super cool and hooked us up with a bunch of hats for our pirate party.
0	QhvjH7BSOaFd1NJBBmwzJg	Wayyyy too packed at Nikki Beach.   Tip: Be sure to find a promoter to get in for free, cause I don't think it'd be worth it to pay.   We went on a Saturday afternoon. Nikki Beach looks nice, I like the all white theme and intimate environment. However, the pool is so small and it was so packed. We couldn't find space for our party of 15+, so we decided to just hang out at the regular pool.
0	eI7W6gQeqUDPPJVHpk8Mw	A great breakfast place!  The place can use a make over, but I thought it was charming and you went back in time with the red and white checkered floors, and what looked liked original counter and green worn leather stools.  The staff was nice and friendly too.  I stayed at the Westin Hotel and it was about a 10 block walk (1 mile).  My husband and I shared the Steeler breakfast plate and it was one of the best breakfests we had.  It was a good thing we shared bc it came with 2 toasts, 2 (8") pancakes, 1 (5") sweet sausage, 2 slices bacon, home fries, 2 eggs.  Every item was cooked perfect and the pancakes were the best I had at a restaurant, a bit crispy and fluffy inside.   Too bad we were so full and couldn't finish the pancakes and toast.  Everything else we finished with a smile.  The portions are large.  We had 2 cups of very good coffee and the Steeler special and our bill was $12.  A bargain for all we had.    If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I would go there again and try more of the resturants on the Strip District.
0	UzYTYrTS9FrMwLtWtQRZgQ	Pretty pricey, but always a great place to visit in Vegas.  I went here twice (once w/ a bunch of friends, another time w/ my husband), and had great meals both times.  When I went here w/ my hubby it was especially nice since we got to sit in one of the best seats in the house, with a fantastic view of the bellagio fountains (I asked for it when I booked the place on opentable more than a month before, and I can't believe they actually gave it to me).  When I was last there, I had the seared foie gras appetizer, filet topped with foie gras (you can tell I was totally jonesing for foie gras that day), and the chocolate souffle for dessert.  Mmmm...yum.  I know there are probably a lot of fancier and better places in Vegas, but I still think this place deserves 4 stars for a wonderful meal, great service, and an unbeatable view.
0	fS86nX1tqtnSuAsmLPI6A	This bar is awesome.  One of a kind.  Only in Vegas will you find a bar made of ice and probably some fo the best martinis I have ever had.  This bar is just worth going and trying a drink or two even if you dont plan on staying long.
0	fiIxortOBaI3RZBRgLhaTg	I too will agree that they are a friendly staff, the place is clean and the service quick. And they still manage to make brief friendly conversation while doing their job. The food is fresh and they actually understand the concept of splitting a sandwich by cutting and wrapping the paper around two halfs! Can't say that they understand or care at other locations.
0	53I7etZVp4QVx6azqXQ	My one complaint was toward the dizzy hostess, but everything else was great.  We did not have a reservation and was told that we can have a table.  However, the hostess walked us over to the sushi bar, even after I requested no sushi bar seating, so we declined.  We walked out and dined at the its lounge area instead.  The Japonais lounge area is right smack in a busy crossing area for people going/leaving the casino area.  We were people-watching while waiting for our food.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was much more comfortable to eat here (in a chaise/sofa) instead of the dine-in area.  It feels more romantic, most likely due to the draperies, low lighting, faux trees, and sound of waterfalls.  The full menu and bar selections are also available in the lounge area.  The restaurant also allows the convenience of charging your bill to your hotel - as long as it's part of the MGM hotel line (We stayed at the Bellagio)   As for food, it's no different than the one in Chicago.  Overall, we enjoyed the food and were glad that we dined at the Japonais lounge area instead as we had 2.5 hours to kill before the Cirque "LOVE" show, which was showing in the same hotel.
0	P0jNDFYSJStZDI4SJDQ	I am a HUGE fan of Rubio's Fish Tacos with flour tortilla of course. I don't think I have had fish tacos anywhere else that was so yummy! The fish is always crispy and tender in the middle and the cabbage isn't overbearing and overstuffed. I also love the fact that Rubio's has a salsa bar that you can pick different salsas out. When I'm feeling for something a  lil healthier this is the place that I go to....although I'm not sure how deep fried anything is healthier.
0	SrS44ygR7GcjxxtD95OMpQ	Une personne qui travaille \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d'Akemi m'avait recommand\u00e9 l'endroit. Je n'y suis all\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 une seule reprise pour acheter des sushis pour emporter et je ne crois pas que j'y retournerai.

Pour des sushis rapides et pas trop chers \u00e0 Verdun, je recommande plut\u00f4t Sushi Time sur Wellington ou encore, Aka Fuji pour un repas de qualit\u00e9!
0	ywqEDINntXxMagEDSU6g	Surprisingly good. We enjoyed a bunch of kitchen dishes and nigiri. Place was surprisingly empty on a tuesday evening. Enjoyed the tako su, flounder carpaccio, eggplant, spinach with sesame dressing. Portions all generous on kitchen dishes. Nigiri cut conservatively. Decent selection including uni. Tomago was nice but thinly cut. Really great low key Japanese food.  However, I believe there has been an ownership with a chef from the original place stlil in the kitchen, but the focus now seems to be on maki and glitz.
0	Dxpg39cpZnJJqQewTdisbA	Had dinner with a group of friends and felt the food was very over rated.  Bison burger was salty and the service was took forever.  Had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever.  Disappointing experience.
0	SEFfuEvQ8cgUtreu4eEgyQ	As a weekend tourist in Charlotte, in the twenty minutes I was standing outside waiting for a bus back downtown I saw eight or ten young, hip looking people going in here and they were playing decent music, probably from a juke box.  Through the hexagonal porthole windows you can also see a foosball table.  The next time I'm in town I'll take time to check out more of this interesting looking neighborhood bar than just the sidewalk.
0	BHTObWCrigr8xIpS5yDPLg	This was only the second Dim Sum place we have eaten at in LV.  But no need to search for another one.   It was really packed and we waited for a while before we were seated.  But that is a good sign so no complaints there.  They just needed more bench and chairs for the older folks so they can sit while they wait.    The dim sum is fresh, warm and you can even order what you do not see.  Go before the busy time so you don't wait long.   My fave there is the calamari.  I love the egg pie, the crust is soooo flaky and yumms.     This place was highly recommended to me ....I highly recommend it to everyone.....!
0	lfDcwWrlzVADxT3LQeLWAw	This place was great, a small hole in the wall with friendly service and yummy food. They make their burritos to order, so it was easy to leave out any dairy to make it vegan. Also, when we went they were having happy hour margaritas and they are hand made! Yum.
0	MPwUD33VNWIzrCrZ87MsQ	Thai Spoon, what can I say?  Definitely not as good as Nicky's in the North Side.  The crab rangoons were not good, no crab at all and a super sweet cream cheese in an over fried wrapper.  I ordered green curry, I like a little spice, I ordered a 6, but could barely Taste the heat.  The broth was watery and the vegetables were absent.  I did get a lot of bamboo shoots.  We also tried the pad Thai which Was acceptable. Dinner for two including one appetizer, two entrees and water to drink was $29.00.  Interestingly they print a tip calculator on your bill!

0	6H0xePbvbTtumGrskNqCw	THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. Their bagel sandwiches are to die for, of course, but one of my favorite things is is actually their chicken matzo ball soup that is served with little bagel chips!!! SO delicious and perfect for a hangover AND there is a lot of it so I can usually take it home and eat it later too! The service is totally fast and friendly. Cash only kind of sucks but they definitely make it work. I would give this place a definite 5-star rating except....I can't figure out how to get my picture on the wall in one of those little buildings! Haha just kidding (kinda). Definitely worth the venture off the strip even though the surrounding neighborhood is kind of crappy. Oh well :)
0	IRM4XbnefV11d707Pq7w	I used to eat a Swish a lot when it first opened.  I moved away and just recently came back to Vegas.  I was looking forward to having dinner and went to the old location on Sahara.  Hopefully they were bought by someone other than the owner at Spring Mountain as my dinner last night was sub-par.  The meat was ok however, the veggies looked horrible and this was not the same quality that I received previously.  I also noticed that a few of the employees were Korean.  Nothing against Koreans, but part of what made Swish so good was that it was authentic Japanese style.  I'll have to try the location at Spring Mountain and report back.
0	afqFBolfhAIUyTEHlyFclQ	As I sit here, sandwich done, I am currently waiting on a milkshake that has gone unnoticed on their clothespin line they use to slide orders down on. Their system involves paper bags customers mark with their order, each type of sandwich having their own bag and toppings. Each sandwich type is numbered and the bag holders are numbered accordingly. We used the suspend and ordered two combos totaling 18 bucks. Damn.   The staff looks flustered, almost as if training was thrown out the window and the manager figured that they'd figure it all out on their own. Subway has a better system and that's saying something. We waited and our names were called out for our orders.   The sandwiches are in subway type rolls, wrapped in those old fashioned silver hamburger papers and parchment with their logo. They come warm, which is fine. The bread is good but the meat and toppings are just okay. In all honesty I was shocked that my sandwich only had two large slices of turkey sandwich meat. Weird. I chose the cranberry and stuffing version, one I learned to love from another sandwich store. It was okay. The BLT comes with crumbled bacon, although strange it tasted like a BLT.   Overall, I think because they're new the kinks are still being worked out. I hope that when I return in 6 months the food and service improved.
0	2etuI24EMqF0UL6go3eNg	My husband and I were really enjoying this place.  The food's not bad and the location is great.  Unfortunately our last order of pizza made us SUPER sick.  And by super sick, I mean we were both up at 4am the next day with the violent pukes and had to call out sick to work.  Very disappointing. :(  I would give them another try but just thinking about it makes my stomach hurt.  I guess it's back to Barro's.
0	L5eZnDE4By1JDUszG76xyA	Well, I'm pretty sure the meat here is unused leftover from the Top Of The World next door. It makes sense. I'd probably do the same thing if I were the chef except they deceive unaware guests into thinking otherwise by hiking the price up. $20 for a sandwich and a coke. Well, it's OK, I guess because it is good but I can't help to think it's just unused leftover. Which, to be clear, is perfectly safe, but usually just day old meat. That's great if the steak from TOTW was actually high quality. It's not. I ate there the night before I ate here. If my medium steak from TOTW wasn't so over cooked, I would've been happy to have it redone and then eat the original at the Carver station the next day. Instead, got over done steak twice. Ugh.
0	GJuM6BR9cL5dtGZSQivQ	I like this place. There aren't a lot of good Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant choices up north- unless you're into the usual china-a-go-go type places. People are friendly and courteous and are more than happy to make any order cooked just the way you like it. The food is good too.
0	FB1LfDA0wEZcgXWOpGkCTw	I was excited about the possibility of good BBQ in NoSco.  My excitement was immediately tamed.  The meat? eh, almost tasted like liquid smoke.  The sauce? watered down, the regional stuff(carolina, texas, etc.) didnt even come close.  The price? $30 for 2 sandwiches, sides, and tea?  no thank you.  wont be back.
0	JU6IMVWIDnRpxfUHbJhxw	This is going to be short.  Went here this past Sunday.....Everyone enjoyed their food.  Service was just ok.  The floor was dirty.  The menus had food on them.  They need to take time to clean them.
0	fVrN6Wriib2DlG63iq0nA	The restaurant has a nice ambiance, the service was good. The night I went they had live music that added to the nice ambiance. I had marinara sauce with zucchini noodles and cheese cake for desert. I felt that the garlic was hugely overpowering in the entree and I generally found it unsatisfying, especially for the price. The cheesecake was pretty good but certainly not worth the price either.  In short, I would not go back as I felt it was overpriced and I felt unsatisfied when I left. I love to eat healthy, organic food but not at the expense of taste.
0	yZY3bsF9tpaqH3eIZU0hw	Great stop as my gf and I were staying at the Four Seasons and we wanted food stat. Keep in mind, it was extremely hot, we just arrived, and were hungry. But the food was good, the mexican chopped salad was plentiful and the avocado was fresh. I had the sangria and my girlfriend had the pomegranate margarita, which she loved. There is construction so it was a maze of sorts to get to the actual restaurant area. But for the price, a nice sit down lunch.
0	vLFMJowwavfnIiV7GH5cBw	El Pollo Loco is great but this location is pretty hit or miss. I'd rate it 2.5 stars if I could but since I can not, 2 stars it is.   On my last visit I ordered 2 of the 2 piece combo plates, with flour tortillas. Sweet potato fries and a salad were the sides I selected for myself, mac and cheese and rice for the husband. My husband loves these combo plates and has a whole routine down for eating it... He shreds the chicken and makes himself tacos with the tortillas and the rice which he always gets as one of his two sides.   They forgot our orders of flour tortillas. No do-it-yourself tacos for my husband. Also the rice was undercooked and the mac and cheese was on the watery side. The chicken was still on point though...   The Lake Mead location is more consistent so I will be going there from now on, even when I am closer to this location.
0	hjbmXrrmbJ5Al4ioJGbTOw	Ocean Blue is a little mom and pop carribean joint in a Chandler Blvd strip mall.  I feel bad for the owners as they see how packed Subway is next door.  I guess it's hard to compete with five-dollar footlongs.  The restaurant used to be burrito chain, and the inside looks roughly the same as it did before.  It's an odd layout where the tables are cramped by the bar, which seems always empty.  I brought a real live Jamaican guy with me for lunch, so I could get his opinions as well.  It turns out that I didn't need much expert insight.  We opted for the buffet which had exactly 5 items:  jerk chicken, blackened tilapia, mayo-based macaroni salad, red beans & rice, and some kind of  cinammon pie for dessert.  Notice there were no vegetables.  However, there was no red meat or fried items, so it wasn't totally unhealthy.  The jerk chicken was bone-in dark meat pieces that had nice flavor but not much heat.  Everything was good (except the dessert), but nothing was outstanding.  I even enjoyed the macaroni salad.  There just wasn't much variety, and the food suffered from "looking like something I could make myself at home", even though I'm usually too lazy to do so.  The dessert was the lone disappointment.  It tasted like pumpkin pie mixed with stale cornbread.  Well, the Jamaican guy liked it, and the price was only $8, but I still can't go above 2 stars for this place.  The buffet items change daily, and they have a non-buffet menu, so maybe a 2nd experience will wow me more than the first.
0	M2nh7i1IkMpcz3opQzKVw	I am torn between a four and a five star review. I have eaten at Go Raw Cafe a couple of times. The first time with my folks, which kind of soured the experience for me since they were continually criticizing of everything (which they do in general regarding my being vegan). The food I had the first time I went was pretty good, though I got one of the veggie juice drinks and I just could not stomach it. As surprising as it is, my mom the ultra nag ended up drinking it!  Fast forward over a year. I just got back from Go Raw Cafe and I had the "Cheese burger". The burger was HUGE. It came on a well decorated plate with the burger on one "bun" and the toppings on the other. I started to eat the two separately but one of the ladies at the restaurant urged me to put the burger together, mash it all down, and go ahead and make a mess. Well, I did and I have to say the burger was amazing and very filling.  I will definitely be going back to sample more of their dishes. Who knows maybe I'll end up changing the review to five stars!
0	dzSuVapVMPVnvte3aGPEIQ	Awesome food! We've come here for about 8 years now. Always good and fresh. Mushrooms and bean sprouts are great and hot and sour soup is the bomb. Good for both lunch and dinner.  Military discount accepted.
0	fjMJ5p93TaCQW1DUez3OQ	DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF SNACKS!!  stumbled onto this place looking for the chick-fil-a (there's apparently not one in the mall any longer) and the couldn't resist the tasty looking pictures! So even though we were not craving Mexican, we were easily convinced...   ***DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES!!!***  Even though the cashier was very nice and friendly, almost everything went wrong with our order... My wifey and I wanted "Tortas" because the picture looked most appealing... She asked if they used guacamole or avocado and the cashier said they were actually out of both,  so she changed her mind to two tostadas (also looking very appealing) one chicken, one steak. I ordered the steak torta combo... simple order? right....? HOW COULD YOU MESS THAT UP???  FORGOT:   1. Beans on the tostadas...  2. One chicken tostada, we got two beef 3. My combo, I had to wait for my fries and soda to be prepared  TASTE COMPLAINTS:  1. Steak was rough, chewy, and unseasoned 2. Fries were unseasoned, and salt and pepper was not available 3. We tasked for a water cup, she accidentally put coke in it, pored the coke out and gave us water with out even rinsing the cup... ewwwww!  I saw that other customers ordered snacks like fruit and chips that looked very appealing, but I will definitely not order a entree from here again!
0	VynccUagP91uZPJ521VHg	Don't order take out. There portions are so small. I was really disappointed. My chicken was literally raw inside, the service was crap, they forgot my dressing. All I ordered was sides and a piece of grilled chicken. Simple enough...I thought. Stick to the other location till they get all there kinks worked out.   The Biltmore location is much more laid back and not nearly as trendy and wannabe hollywood.  The waitstaff is much more together and the portions are consistent. Im staying with that location.
0	t0jnEh4SJAv5jjtCfN67w	Cheap, quick, and pretty good mexican food.  The guys working here are usually very friendly and provide quick service.  It isn't exactly the cleanest place, but I never eat in anyways, I usually just take it home since I live close by.
0	iXZjt45LLmhjl1thDnP1OQ	Yeah, I'm giving 4 stars to a freaking Taco Bell. This Taco Bell is so nice and pretty that I feel the need to dress up a bit (wearing pajamas whilst going through the drive-thru here just seems too grungy). It's on the newer side. The staff are some of the best and most professional I've ever seen at a fast food joint. And the service is always friendly, quick, and accurate. So yeah, it kinda earns 4 stars.
0	HGpZfmyGTTDruPIKRasLCA	Went on opening day, they had tons of staff but were still slow. We ordered two hot dogs and fries and they forgot the fries. I got the chili dog, it was ok. He got the Chicago dog and liked it. Fries were good. Price is moderate.
0	j1ju7KL4tPEnBjdQL9sHQ	I love love love this place.  Its kind of an epic journey from midtown with all the construction going on downtown right now.  But, on those rare days that I can justify a 90+ minute lunch, this is in the top five.  Fancy sandwiches and salads.  Sinful desserts.  And an art gallery.
0	PGMJoV3QOYeGLFN5HotCw	Cold beer but the food was no bueno.  Hot wings were good sized but not cooked all of the way. The sauce was not very appealing either, it had more of a peppery or picante spice vs a Buffalo style sauce.  We had the nachos too and they were well portioned but pretty bland. Instead of a carne asada or flank steak they served it with ground beef which isn't necessarily bad, but it had no seasoning.  They have a good beer selection, so that gives them a couple stars.
0	i5VZ2Em9YwaaHvNvuUQQow	I was a fan of Churches chicken till I came to this location. Oh where do I begin. First they no longer have the popcorn chicken my kids liked so I ordered them 3 ( remember that number for later) chicken tenders. I ordered the 3 (not yet) piece meal all dark meat. I got our cups and got drinks for my kids. I wanted ice tea but the dispenser on the counter was empty. The person working the counter said he would fill my cup for me but his dispenser was almost empty. As we waited other customers came in and ordered. All of us were sitting around waiting for them to cook the food nothing was ready. When we got our food my kids 3 (ok now) piece tenders turned into 4 and my all dark meat meal had a breast in it. People who were going through the drive in were now coming inside to find out where there orders were. I went to get a refill on my ice tea but they were out.
0	5Hx6Yk7g8aVzTMM2lLg8Hw	The food is very tasty and the service was attentive keep in mind that business was very slow during dinner time .  The place is certainly a welcome addition to an area chock-full of boring, regular ole Scottsdale restaurants.   I ordered Ceviche and the  1/2 chicken which was good, but I had better. The prices are a little overpriced  We would go back to eat more often if the food was 15-20% less expensive and it would be even nicer if more people visited. Dinner for two with drinks $ 90.00
0	c7Zrj6EGjz2oX66rvDyIPQ	It was OK; nothing great.  I thought it was expensive & the seating capacity not good.  I was there during lunch hour and they had "Reserved" signs on all the tables.  I asked the manager why were they all reserved.  He said they do that because it gets crazy during lunch so they will seat us!?  WTH?  Tried it once & that was enough.
0	lC66ZXDtCn4F9PKCVwxw	Another location of this restaurant chain has gotten some good press in the newspaper recently, so when this location opened, I was eager to try it.  Overall I was dissapointed and won't be going back.  Their real coffee is weakish and slightly acidic.  Their decaf coffee was better but also weak.  Eggs are pale and bland.  Hash Browns have nice appearance but are also bland.  On the bright side, Biscuits and Gravy are good, with buiscuits being fluffy (a rarity).  Service is excellent and the atomosphere of the place is nice and bright.
0	GQWjPZ04ELjPQ0lehwA	If you're looking to meet people this is not your spot. I came in and there were only 4 people while the bar next door was packed. The place looks like it has potential for a nice chill spot but would seem a poor choice if sports or food are on your mind.
0	FxLuDDx20yKsIh4YBy8A	Disappointing  Nothing wrong with the food, it's nicely presented. I sincerely don't get the hate, I've seen worse and more expensive at other places with less criticism.  And the fries are great (pro tip Montreal: mushy fries are a no-no everywhere else)  But the service was not great. Yeah, we didn't get the condiments, ok, someone else brought them later.  Then we got a wrong check for our table (it was even for less than we had), having that fixed, their card machine didn't work properly. Yay.  Sorry, hard to recommend it.
0	qvWgP1GpeW9ay89NVcsA	Essence is a great addition to Tempe.  The food is bistro style, the chef Eugenia does amazing things with savory and sweet alike.  The ambience is nice, very simple and under done, it is funny how you have to get your own coffee, water and silverware, but that is bistro style and also keeps help costs down.  I go here for breakfast every other weekend, though it is not open on Sunday :(  The food is amazing, the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is the portions are too small and could be bigger without any effort.  I would say it is a bit over priced, but Arizona breakfasts all are, so for this you get quality for your $12.  The mascarones are some of the best cookies I've ever had, get the caramel.  I had the burger the other week and it was good, with a garlicy whole grain mustard and brioche bun, but it didn't hold up through the whole meal.  The potato salad was way too mustardy.  I am thankful for Essence and everyone that works there, they are the envy of all other restaurants in the valley.
0	PJQ37INA0Sfl1zaO1fhZg	I have always enjoyed Carl's Jr! This one is not to far from my work, I was actually looking for the Puerto Rican food restaurant in the same strip mall. Since they were closed I went ahead and ate at CJ's!! Just like any of their franchise, food is good, never been a fan of their fries! CJ's is always adding to their menu, so you need to look at it once in awhile. You might miss something you might like!!! I had their Memphis Burger! This beast consist of: hamburger pattie, pull pork, onion rings, and bbq sauce. You have an option to add another pattie if you want, but you don't need to!!! Burger was great, loved the fusion of all the flavors! Service was great, they were training a new worker when they took my order. This location seem to have  a lot more seats! Lots of room!! Area is not that great, but this is a nice location!!
0	0vMIZVmqPHpLHoS53bSVbw	I like it here! It's a good place to get lunch right after church on Sundays.   Their fries - GOOOD. Curly fries - not as good, but still good.  I love all the different sandwiches they have. Some of them are hit or miss though. I don't know if the deli's been having off days when I was there recently, but the sandwiches were just "eh" this time. Usually they're pretty good though. They usually have a good philly cheesesteak. Their pulled pork is really good too. Nice, soft pork. Yum!  Also, last time I remember that they had chicken nachos and that was SO GOOD, but looking at the menu.. it's not there anymore? So unfortunate.. but in case I am mistaken! Order it. It's filling and good and very shareable with everyone (:
0	u7S8Dcx5JD5CSmQAxceHA	I am devastated they no longer have $2 margaritas Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays. I loved the old location and was eagerly waiting this one to open. However, it seems more pretentious in its new digs.
0	kJBLkqCUb2L6tkn5oJvz7g	I was driving around, looking for a place to eat lunch after a long hike, and was excited to see a sign for Capriotti's, claiming it was voted the "best sandwiches in America". I ordered an Italian Sausage (hot sandwich). I was a little confused when I unwrapped it and saw just sliced Italian sausage on a bun. That was it. I started wondering if I had missed a crucial part of the ordering process (was there a list of toppings I was supposed to choose from?). Who knows. The sandwich was OK, but didn't live up to my expectation of "best sandwich in America". Despite my disappointment, I will likely give them another chance. Service was friendly and the cookie was the best part of the meal.
0	19IYHrFMlfsgxnqY67eyw	Save your money and go to Kyoto Bowl. Our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like we're children. They have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self-service buffet. They stand there like if you get out of line, you're bad. Weird...During this time, the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have. Then when you get to the buffet, the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you don't get to put much food in. Some of it is meant to be like sushi, uncooked, but since you put it in a bowl, it gets cooked with everything else. Oh yeah, and the place is loud. You'll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family. The novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven. That's the coolest thing about this place. They serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls. At this point, the food has really shrunk. The food is tasteless. Anyways, they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill, I was shocked by the price ~ $10 a bowl. If I had $10, I'd rather go to Taco Bell.
0	XIIGu9QEgYMiBiGG1Mt4g	I've never really had good from little Caesar's, until I moved to Hender"tucky".   The pizza places around here, just aren't that good. Between hair being baked into my pizza, grease and awful crust.... I had just about given up on finding pizza by our home.  One night, my guy brought home LC.  I was skeptical. I mean, with all the "pizza" spots we had tried, how was I going to enjoy this ....?  Gladly, I was wrong.  The deep deep dish pizza has always been executed well. Crunchy crust, just enough golden brown cheese.  My newest addition is the pretzel pizza, that uses a cheese sauce instead of tomato, and has lovely pieces of salt around the crust.  The thing that annoys me... There are only four chairs. Pretty much standing room only. And they need your ID for any credit card. I mean, really for a $7 purchase...?
0	G0dyQNXOZcegWUYJ69lOA	Ok I am not a Boa fan. I have been to the Tempe location and was not impressed. The menu is different in Mesa but I still was not happy. Of course who doesn't love getting 100pt at OpenTable and D'Vine was of course packed on a Friday night so I unwilling checked into Caffe Boa. The wine list is nothing impressive and there isn't many options as far as food goes. I ordered the California salad. Blah! The only part I liked was the avocado and I mean how badly can you mess up avocado, just pick up a ripe one and cut it properly! Congrats Caffe Boa, epic win on that! Other than that, overpriced and not the greatest flavor. I'll stick with waiting 30 mins for a table at D'Vine.
0	3BR6kBhCuodhIwq7SyAQ	I've been to Le Ragazze a handful of times and my past experiences have always been great, but my last visit was not so good...  Upon arriving we immediately noticed the menu had changed (we heard they have new owners).  Our favorite appetizer was gone and some of the other dishes were gone as well.  We decided to skip the appetizer. I ordered one of the specials - a bone in rib eye with some kind of mushroom sauce.  I ordered my steak medium rare.  My girlfriend ordered another special - Scallops with pasta.  They gave us some bread with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  It was ok, but the bread was rather bland in my opinion.  Our meals came out promptly and looked delicious.  I cut into my steak and it was well done.  I requested the server have them recook me a steak medium rare and my girlfriend and I shared her meal...  Her scallops were cooked perfectly, but we both agreed that the dish was under seasoned...  My second steak came out and I cut into it immediately (before they left this time.  The initial cut looked good so I thanked them and proceeded to taste the steak.   All I can say is - bland!  This steak had no flavor whatsoever.... all I could taste was the char. Then I made my second cut  and we discovered that my steak was way undercooked.  I'm talking rarer than rare!  I swear I could still hear the thing mooing!  I didn't feel like wasting any more time sending the steak back again (and I'm always a bit scared about sending stuff back) so we decided to take the rest of the steak home for the dogs.     I still can't believe I spent $36 on that steak!   I should asked for a refund, but I didnt...  At least the dogs liked it :)
0	hjf4mgH2ikbW3T18BhJZQ	if u like hearty portions for cheap prices, than this is the place for u! the food is frigging hot, u can tell it was cooked to order. the unlimited salsa bar really puts it over. the service is really the only thing that could use a little help, but its a casino restaurant so i can imagine the creeps they run into:) Me and my man both ordered appetizers, entrees and desserts and paid a grand total of $27!!! it was a "Uno Dos Tres Deal" and we brought the half home we didn't eat! In this economy, this was a really great meal for an AWESOME price :-D
0	BHQtgy9bxyyzby9plZ88w	Awesome happy hour bar, late night bar and everything in between!  Go Friday nights and they will have a live band (but it is always too loud for this old lady's ears!)  The food here is fantastic, I have had the chicken wrap and it is always a ton of food for not a lot of money.  There are fun arcade-type games in the back and plenty of seating.  They always have really sweet bartenders and servers.  Love this place!!!
0	YElJtIzOasMRO7ZLGdmA	I'd been anxious to try this little place since the night i popped a flat tire at the sunoco across the street from it. they had just opened and it had all the things that draw me in to a new place--it was tiny, filled with people who looked to be enjoying their evening, had minimal but satisfying decor, and it was byob. when my birthday rolled around, my friends asked me where i wanted to dine and i chose stagioni. we piled in and were immediately seated at our reserved table for 10, and were very well and happily taken care of. the rest of the place was filled, and our appetizers were great which led me to believe we were in for a flawless dining experience. then, our meals took a long time to appear, and were all just OK. nothing had any special FLAVOR. my best friend's 'shrimp and grits' entree had fantastic, juicy, giant shrimp floating in a bowl of watery, bland grits. not to mention that my rabbit ragu pasta came out looking totally different from another friend's, a mistake which the waitress attempted to remedy by bringing him a separate bowl of the ingredients the chef had forgotten to add to the dish himself. one friend's dish came out 5 minutes after everyone else's had been brought to the table. they brought us 2 complementary desserts to make up for their errors, and i left the place not unhappy, but pretty disappointed. i'd had high hopes for the place. their seasonal menu is very well thought out and the intention is there. the idea is there. but the execution is off. maybe they just aren't yet equipped to handle such big parties, and i may go back again with just one other person to give it one more shot, but overall i was not impressed. granted, the service was fantastic, but i would much prefer to go somewhere else where i can count on getting a good meal than risk the mediocrity i found at stagioni again.
0	BxG6RrxnYL7vzrg298pdQ	I really liked our dinner the other night. Full liquor license which is great to find in a sushi place, and they had Echigo beer which is a huge plus. Complimentary yummy edemame, also a great plus, especially when you're as hungry as we were. Started off with awesome rock shrimp and some kind of delicious tataki salad over seaweed which was also great. Had some great spicy hand rolls and then a bunch of shared rolls which were all delish - can't remember all the ones we specifically had but do remember trying one wrapped in cucumber per our server's recommendations and really liked it. Not sure how it is for nigiri and sashimi but for rolls this is a great spot.
0	HJqqyyoIuVelNfouhxTbqg	A little conflicted here. The food was a solid four stars. The portions were ample and the taste was spot on. The "service" on the other hand is non-existent. My server was unfriendly and hurried. Not the normal all business type that you usually get in Asian restaurants, but just plain horrible at his job. Came up to the table and just stood there looking out the window...not a word to me, just stood there. You can get the same good food elsewhere with better service and cheaper prices. Don't bother here.
0	5HUUtEfPkaFvaGBaE1lEw	4 stars for Pizza quality.  Would have given 5 stars if the shop looked less ghetto.  I'm not sure if the shop looked any better, they would make pizzas better than what they already have.    QUALITY Joey's pizza tastes good. If you are used to having a pizza from one of those popular chains (Dominos, Pizza Hut) regularly, treat yourself with a good tasting pizza from here.  OPTIONS I got a 14" large pizza with 5 (yes five!!) toppings for just 14.99.  Went with all veggie toppings. Next time I will swap those jalapeno topping for extra olives or mushrooms.  But nevertheless Pizza still tasted good.  VALUE What you get is definitely more than what you pay for. What was supposed to be a pizza dinner for two of us, easily made for left over breakfast for next day morning (having all veggie toppings helped for having it as breakfast).  Would definitely go back next time I crave Pizza.
0	rDqTbFCcVgJDRe5631FsQ	what is it about vegas and the walls made out of rocks?  they have one here and it boggles the mind.  the overall decor seems to be rock-themed.  very good, very honest and simply delicious food.  the flavors are wonderful and they win the award for best use of miso...  not exactly filling, but a divine experience as far as taste and ambiance are concerned.
0	s5W6sRwt1z9PsSZBJPBAA	When this place first opened up, I was completely addicted.  I'm a creature of habit and a slave to convenience, and seeing as how it's close to everywhere I usually am both of those teamed up to fill me up with so much Taco Time food that I was basically a mobile Taco Time.  And hey, it ain't bad for Mexican fast food!  It sure beats the crap out of Taco Bell and was a welcome change.  Their crisp chicken burritos are good, their chicken soft tacos are a delight, and I'm a big fan of their smothered enchilada that they give a funny name which I can't remember at this time.  The mexi-fries are awesome.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for the stuffed kind, sometimes I just feel like being a tot purist, and they're always totally good.  But, seriously, it's a tot.  It's hard to mess up the perfection of the tot.  Mmmm, tot.  Inside they have a little salsa bar with salsa and ranches and chipotle ranches that make sauce fiends like I really happy.  Also, for the weird ones like me who have distinct ice preferences - They have great ice.  The tiny crushy cube variety that's good for post-soda chewin', not great big hunks of ice.  And they have Cherry Choke.  Always a plus.  Once I saw a roach.  I try not to think about that too much, and I know that even the cleanest of places (cause, really, it does look pretty clean) can get the random critter from time to time.  But, I did see a roach and sometimes I CAN'T forget it.
0	sj3YyLFa2tFbv3NvwLyvvA	I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner.  Unfortunately, it must have been an off night.  The waitress didn't want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didn't have much flavor.  That's the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasn't "bad," but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasn't drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.  This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brother's name!  So I was really disappointed.
0	kev6VXaGF4tvIyCPmYElg	Cute ambiane. The professionalism behind the gelato counter? Not so much.  Hankering for some gelato after dinner at Girasole, we came to Mercurio's for dessert. They have a good variety of flavors, as well as the sorbettos. I asked one of the girls at the counter if I could sample some flavors. They give you so little to sample! I then asked another girl if I could sample another flavor and she too gave a teeny little scoop! Come on now...  I settled on the Tiramisu and the girl did a poor job scooping. It looked so sloppy, unprofessional, and the size of the scoop was also pretty small. Good tiramisu though, but beware of their stinginess. Disappointed.
0	12xBr6Cvoq0PTfN7fxfxA	Thank goodness I fled the streets of Paris to head over to this buffet!  It was soooooo good.  At a buffet I'm a sampler, and if I can't control the portions I just go for a taste.   I recall that the couple to my side was absolutely appalled that I picked up about 5 desserts.  Well, not so much appalled but absolutely jealous that I exhibited no shame for my total commitment to pigging out ...he,he,he.  Bastards!  I was appalled that no one else left a tip for the servers.\r \r Oh, why the missing star?  Only b/c I remember the best brunch ever at this one hotel on Waikiki...will update if I can remember which it was.
0	1KE4TPgZ9iPww0XQCSKjA	went to this place twice for a few beers on girls night. let's just say they aren't too keen on outsiders. the few folks that were there were regulars and the staff did not want to acknowledge or even make eye contact with us. we ended up having to move up to the bar for service. Or Bill was outrageous for what we order in the limited time we were there. The food lacked luster as well. we won't be going back.I'll take my money where they are looking to welcome new "regulars".
0	s5qQppQZ3GWohUJ15Ny9qg	Finally a pizza that competes with my Zpizza's personal concoctions. Stop by this place if you're a wine lover as well. They only have a few selections of wine and beer, but from what I've had they've been pretty tasty.   Mozzarella, Fontina cheese, and basil pizza. I can't help not to eat the whole thing when I go there. Hey! They're thin crust, and I'm a man with a huge appetite. I usually get take out, but the next time I go I'm dinning in with company.
0	m1HytxqK6MaLaQ7EpSWLbQ	BAM! (for whatever reason that always makes me think of Bam Margera, but I digress)  I'm not a huge fan of his show, but I am a big fan of his food.  After watching him make his gumbo on television and attempting to make it ourselves at home, we had to give 'the real thing' a try.  It was delicious.  Our visit to the Fish House was a couple of years ago, so my memory is somewhat fuzzy on what the other people in our group had to eat.  However, I remember distinctly that we all thoroughly enjoyed everything - appetizers, entrees and dessert.  The atmosphere was modern and fresh (for some reason, I kept picturing some semi-cheezy casual environment with wooden planks - something stereotypical that you would see on the wharf) - it was elegant and spacious.  Service was great.  Emeril's Fish House is in the MGM Grand, and from the moment we walked into the hotel to when we got to the restaurant, it must have taken us 10-15 minutes to get there.  I cannot get over how HUGE that hotel is.
0	UxXGRiFUWPLmbIcvUjgqA	We go to El Pastor a lot.  We like the chips, we like the salsa, we like the 2 dollar dos equis pints, and we like the atmosphere, which is not too clean and not too dirty, but just right.  (The only thing that we miss is a tv playing spanish language soaps).    I almost invariable get tacos, with el pastor as the meat.  $1.75 each.  Typical taco.  Corn torilla.  Three will fill you up. Comes with onion and cilantro and lime wedges.    My favorite item on the menu is the shrimp soup.  For $8.00 you get a piping hot bowl of shrimp (probably like 10-12) in a spicy shrimp flavored broth.  Make sure to order the shrimp whole, heads, shells, and legs and all.  Sure, it's messy eating them, but the shrimp remains tender and juicy, and you can also "suck the head," which sounds bad, but really, it's delicious.
0	2D4Y7C6nyAibkVULXTHA	The Good: $1.75 per item tapas menu of dips, cheeses, and meets.  Gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options.  The Bad:  The food was ok but the service and atmosphere are seriously lacking.  Very slow server.  (Would have given the place 3 stars if I didn't fall asleep at the table waiting for my bill)  What it comes down to is that there is nothing that this place does any better than a Pita Jungle.
0	dKv2HeS4GqOVK6sKfTPLkg	Located inside the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops mall. It's a little hard to find, located somewhat deep in the mall.   This restaraunt is NOT related to the PH Hotel.  Very overpriced mediocre food.  We only ate here because we had gift certificates / vouchers.  The ribs are very mediocre.. stay away.  Blech!   The burgers were safe, but on par with the $1.95 Happy Hour special you'd find somewhere else.  The best part I remember was dessert. The brownie dessert was decent. 3 stars.. The rest is 1-2 stars.   I would be outraged if I had to pay full pop.  The place is rockin with tourists.  It is loud inside.  Reminds me of an upscale Red Robin for Adults.   This place does have a happy hour.. although the bar is pretty small.   This place is closer to 1.5 stars.. and I would never eat here again unless it was free.. but I've been to worse, and the service was OK.
0	uzB8YaApcIbAWI3TIoWdoA	Very basic diner. Decent coffee and service, but otherwise  disappointing.  Instead of going with the inexpensive artery clogging traditional diner breakfast, I paid $8 for "protein power pancakes" which looked great but seemed to have vinegar in the batter.  A very sour and unpleasant taste, so they were inedible.  I complained but was still charged the full price. I won't be returning.
0	lkfpN9h6zTSw5nonFQWrUA	We have gotten pizza here before.  It was ok, not particularly bad, but not anything special either.  It is also disappointing that they do not deliver.    We decided to eat here tonight with our 2 toddler age children because it is a very casual atmosphere, good for kids and they had a special price on dine-in/take-out pizza.  I called ahead to order the pizza so when we arrived 10 minutes later it wouldn't take forever to cool off, since it is straight from the oven, so the kids could eat it.  The person on the phone refused to make our pizza ahead of time.  He told me they had "had trouble with people pre-ordering dine in orders before" & now refuse to do it.    Please explain to me the difference between me ordering a pizza and you trusting I will come to pick it up for take out and me ordering a pizza and showing up to eat it there.  Either way, you are making a pizza and I am showing up after it is made and paying for it. What difference does it make where I eat it?  I did not appreciate being made to feel like an untrustworthy customer or the fact that we would have to show up, order, wait for the pizza to be made with antsy kids, then wait another 10-15 minutes for the pizza to cool before they could eat it.  Not my idea of a relaxing time!  So, no thanks Sunset Pizza!  We took our business elsewhere.  They were more than happy to accommodate our needs and had better prices and food than you.   We had a lovely evening, no thanks to your establishment.  We will not be returning for your "nothing special" food.
0	VGmCuAmzh6CtVMbGGHhA	The two stars are for  good support of local producers and lovely ambiance in downtown Charlotte.  The food was mediocre to bad. I had the French Onion soup and the broth tasted like it was made from Beef Base paste from a plastic tub.  I had the "Soup & Salad," an affectation of a "table-side pressed romano tea" served over a slice of bread, warmed romaine leaves, an unpleasant aioli sauce and a downright fishy tasting "boquerone." I couldn't eat anything else after eating the anchovy--it tasted pretty long in the tooth. The "tea" was unremarkable, and again, the broth tasted like something out of a can.  One of my friends ordered the vegetarian plate: nothing brilliant there. Collards were the main feature. My other friend ordered the "Winter Salad" which featured "bruleed beet carpaccio." Basically steamed beet slices with crunchy sugar on them. And not in a good way.  The waiter, although she was very helpful and pleasant, kept gushing about "Chef tries this" and "Chef believes that" and "Chef always does this other thing." If the food had been excellent, all this Chef genuflection would have been deserved. However, I had the feeling of a completely commercialized effort to exploit the concept of farm-to-table philosophy without the cooking skills to support it. There was no finesse in the food preparation (except in the presentation--the food looked pretty on the plates), or integrity in the ingredients themselves, at least in terms of flavor.  The space is beautiful, a very chic, well-concieved "forest" theme with metal nest chandeliers, fiddlehead fern flatware, river-polished stones for salt-and-pepper shakes, and a gorgeous slab of tree for a table. The chairs were generously wide and comfortable.  IMVHO, this kind of restaurant gives the farm-to-table movement a bad name: all pretense and showmanship with no integrity of serious cooking to back up the concept.
0	bHRIK4G1LWXLOhkGK70chw	How I heart the Claim Jumper!!!  This one sated my craving for their delish deep friend zucchini appetizer in a pinch. Portion for this was smaller than I've seen in other CJs.   The decor was a wee bit less posh than some of the other CJs I've been to though. I had the black tie pasta dish...thought it came with peas but mine was missing them. I ordered the 1/2 portion and couldn't eat it all. Huge portions! My partner had the lobster tail with roast veggies and he can usually eat....but left most of his veggies as there was just so much food.  They don't have the amazing salad bar that CJ's in California and other areas have. They do have a great children's menu though. We ordered an "I Declair" for dessert - $10 but it's a monstrous dessert that feeds 6 or 8 adults. Needless to say, we left much of it untouched.  Service was top notch as always. I'm amazed that this place wasn't busier than we'd seen at other CJs, but it seems that Vegas is in a bit of a "post recession" withdrawal and many places are a bit empty.
0	LisKHHSm4YXfOJMuZWew	This place is pretty hit or miss. The past couple of months they have been good.  I went on monday 05/05/2014 and sadly the guy was looking for every piece of Chicken Adobo with bones... not one piece was all meat.  I got 3 huge bones and hardly any meat. I wouldnt complain but I actually watched him touch each piece to make sure it had a bone... sadly I will have to stop coming here as a result.  The food has been better than usual but just cuz im not Pinoy doesnt mean i shouldnt get chicken instead of bones...
0	rPRYBjSgBXrIUG4snaioGw	All things considered this is my favorite BBQ place in town and in the past I went on a rampage looking for bbq in vegas and would like to think I have tried almost all.  I am not a huge fan of chains but this place serves good BBQ and it's always consistent.  What I love about the place is the BBQ platters for 2 or 4.  It's an upside down garbage can lid with chicken, ribs, pork...  I think you get to pick 3 or 4 meats, plus a couple sides and some cornbread.  Its like 25 bucks for 2 and it's plenty of food and I am a big eater.  Compared to other places it's a deal.    Now it's not the greatest championship bbq but it is still pretty tasty,  the meat is always tender, has a good mild smoke, and is very flavorful.  Also some places do some meats good and others not so much, all there selections are good by me.  They have like 5 sauces that are all good and the sides are solid.  I really like luciles bbq too but the combo I order for myself is 26 bucks so this place is half the price and comparable and consistent, I have had some charred up racks of ribs at luciles.   Break down of vegas BBQ, my opinion of course  Luciles - Delicious, probably the most delicious in vegas, but pricey.  Great atmosphere, great sauce, great meat, and great sides. They serve you biscuits before that are awesome.  Have had some meals there better than others.      TC's - OK overall, light smoke, ribs not the most tender, sides nothing special, pulled pork is good, raised the prices but still not bad  RUB - Ate it once, expensive and not memorable.  Wasn't terrible though  K's - Worst I have had in vegas, the only thing more tasteless than the meat is the sauce.   Cooks - In the ghetto, sweet sauce, decent BBQ, bring a gun  CJs - I guess its texas BBQ, counter serviceand pricey for what you get.  Plain BBQ with thin sauce, didn't get it.   Memphis - Good ribs, mushy pulled pork, pricey I think, good flavor.       Adams - Had a pork sandwich, was dry and the sauce didn't help much.  That's all I remember.  I still need to try buzz, I heard it's good.
0	d1DgE6QZcOpDxqTOUYbyg	Two and a half stars!  A couple of my co-workers and I had to attend an off-site training session this morning.  As a way of saying thanks, our District Director treated the three of us to lunch afterwards.  To tell you the truth, because of all the great sandwich shops Downtown, I'd never eaten at Jimmy John's before.  Subway, Quizno's, Jimmy John's--they're all pretty much alike to me.  I did opt for the Turkey Tom and on its own merits, it was a good sandwich.   The turkey was better than what you get at Subway and the veggies (sprouts, lettuce, tomatos, plus I had them put onions on mine) seemed fresh enough.  Just a couple of notes of caution:  these are 8-inch subs and although you might think a turkey sandwich is light, these bad boys still pack in over 500 calories.  And that ain't even with cheese on it.  And if you opt for the "healthier" 7-grain wheat bread, you're bumping it up to over 600 calories.
0	OiZ9zQuRwHjbKQ4NJ1DA5w	Usually don't want to admit to stopping at a McDonald's, especially since one of my profile photos celebrates a McDonald's being torn down, but here I was, stranded while my car was being repaired nearby. I was treated nicely and was allowed to use their free wifi for a couple of hours.  The positives: Very nicely updated interior, with a couple of large communal seating options for groups. Television. Free wifi.   The negatives: No directly accessible drink refills!!!!!! (You must wait for refills at the counter). The kids play place is very modest and useful for only very young children. No video games. The AC system left the restaurant freezing and drafty on this day.  I think this would have been a three star review if you didn't have to beg for drink refills like it was the 1980's. Perhaps even a four star review if they had a more elaborate play place. But alas, no such luck.
0	cZaBHIxnArCfoDXzoUALw	Great breakfasts. I love their seasoned potatoes and different egg scrambles. If you haven't tried their coffee cake you must go now.  The food was served fast but the rest of the service left more to be desired.
0	oZFy52UDpDRtwKO3uyVmdw	This place has one of the best deals for steak & eggs that I've seen in Vegas. Ellis Island used to hold that distinction until they raised their prices by a dollar but I never really liked Ellis  anyway on account of their charred brick of steak they gave you.  This place, while way off the strip, has even better steak and eggs than Ellis and is cheaper. And the piece they give you isn't 50% fat! Not only that, instead of those dull string beans and potatoes Ellis gives you, you get hasbrowns. Nom nom nom.
0	wNtDAwmqUlC77rBv0BvvJg	Meh. I was really excited to try this place out.  The inside is a lot bigger than I expected and the decor is lovely. The service was really good too!  But the most important part, the food, just lacked. The chips and salsa/guacamole were good. Oh and the sangria.  We started off with the crispy quesadilla which was good. Maybe serve it with a side of sour cream?  I had the lunch special with chicken flautas and a pulled chicken taco. I didn't like the flautas, plus I expected them to be crispy... Didn't care for the rice and usually I love Mexican rice. The taco was alright. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. He thought they were alright, nothing special. For this, plus a beer the total was $44, probably won't return unless it's just for drinks at the bar.
0	u8PjHH7wcSTs6QsWPqvf5g	I guess I was expecting more.  The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good.  But I guess growing local and being "fresh" come at a cost.  Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.
0	0hoU5r5f7OHtR50btQ5Dbw	Despite it being a common topic of discussion on yelp, reviewing a fast food chain is quite useful. Sure the food and prices will be pretty much the same at all locations, but the employees, service, the environment, and other quality issues will vary greatly. The staff at this whataburger are very nice and competent. My only criticism is that sometimes my chocolate malt is not mixed all the way and I get my first strawfull of nothing but chocolate malt sauce. However, this is a hand mixed shake which is a rare luxury in fast food nowadays, and I am receiving 32 ounces of chocolate malt for around 3 dollars and 50   cents. That's about twice as much as you get for the same price anywhere else. Can't beat that. Plus, if you only get a beverage or fries and there is a line in the drive thru, you'll often get to pull up into Lane B, which is shaded and you won't have to wait for the suv full of screaming teenagers or the van with 5 blue collar dudes ordering $14 dollars worth of food EACH. They'll bring it it to you, collect your money, and on your way you go.
0	NDP5Hck1tHU1nAfhbEb9w	We can work long hours at my office, and there are lots of nights where we are hungry and cranky and need food NOW. Our Champaign native suggested Rosati's and we've ordered from there a few times. I really like the freshness of the ingredients, though there often is a bit too much cheese for me. The sauce is nice and thick and garlicky which I loved as well. Sadly, Rosati's is really expensive for Champaign, which makes it difficult to order often for us poor grad students, but it is really good. I'd almost hazard to say it's better than Papadel's. Blasphemy, I know.
0	HXENEd7Kr1sov7LFY4WQg	Ordered Jaeger Schnitzel.  Sauce barely ok, looks like it was made with canned mushrooms.  Second time I was here with comparable disappointing results. Ate at the bar and though friendly, the staff seemed overmatched.  Slow for everything. Haus Murphy much better though portions at both are on the small side. The one-man band with playing German songs was hilarious.  Bottom line, when you need to stop at Del Taco on the way back to the hotel, ...............
0	G8ltzraGQzpfTnxgxD0CaQ	I tried.. I really did. I went to this place a couple of times. I've told you in quick review about the lines. I can manage around those hours. No problem. But what you're getting for the money. It's just not worth it. If you work in the original Energy Center, the burger from Eurist is a million times better - and so are Eurist's fries. The taste of the meat was clean. I'll give them that. I just felt like I was robbed of over $10 for a burger and a fry. Maybe more if I had opted for the drink. Good lord. It's not that good! The people are always nice - and you can call ahead. This is one of those reviews where I put it to my readers to try it for yourself. Maybe I've lost my mind on this one - I seriously don't think so. I have had gourmet burgers before and spent an arm and a leg.. But I was getting Kobe beef for that or an amazing food experience. I would probably suggest heading up to Valhala for a Norse Burger before I sent you here if you don't know where else to go if you're on foot. If you have your car and an hour + for lunch break, drive to the Burger Co very close by on Morehead (giggity) or Pinky's. You'll be so much more thrilled.
0	r8WKcf2Vnn8pYILNj1XZw	This deli is buried deep in the heart of the Wynn so you'll have to navigate a slot machine jungle to find it.  For $15 (that's like a Canadian penny in Wynn money) you get a clear view of the sportsbook -  this place is great during the NFL season - and your choice of the regular deli fare, burgers, sandwiches, large salads.    My favorite is the huge Cobb salad.  It's a monster, and always fresh.    The people watching here is rich and varied.  Since the Wynn is so central, there are plenty of places to walk off your meal - the Fashion Show Mall, Palazzo, Mirage are all within striking distance.   Location, food, sports - Zooza is the Trifecta of Strip delis.
0	yad4E2MOHseTyXdyOnyTg	Checking out hot new businesses on Yelp and I was thrilled to find this place as it happens to be very close to my home. Read the stellar reviews and was happy to give it a try. So I really (really) hate to be the one give it a less than stellar review...  Stopped in this morning for donuts and coffee. They advertise cappuccino so I was really disappointed to see one of those automatic machines you see in a gas station. Cappuccino was no good obviously.  Speaking of cappuccino, the lady serving me didn't understand that cappuccino is not a flavor. I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino (which I threw away after one sip), and the lady brought out 2 drinks. I said I only wanted the hazelnut and she said I ordered the hazelnut and cappuccino. NO. Cappuccino is not a flavor! Anyway, the miscommunication was a little annoying.  As for the donuts, pretty great. I ordered 1/2 dozen - glazed, sugar, toasted coconut, original, and 2 pink sprinkled (for the kids).  The toasted coconut was PHENOMENAL! I will return just for that donut. The original was hard and stale, and the others were good but not mind blowing. I've had better at Bosa consistently.  Customer service was icy. The cappuccino thing aside, the lady was not friendly or helpful. I was not greeted, she didn't say thanks or have a nice day. Nothing. And seemed annoyed that it was taking me awhile to decide which donuts I wanted (it was my 1st time there!)  Anyway, I'll probably return if I have a craving for that toasted coconut donut, but I'll probably drop my 79 cents on the counter (no tip) and get out. Given the great reviews, I was pretty disappointed with my experience today. Hopefully it was just a fluke.
0	HjACmeEyN5Lo6MYLev8R9A	It's frustrating that Mexican food is SO regional in style and flavor. Having lived in Texas for most of my life I am accustomed to Tex-Mex. So naturally, I haven't had much luck finding any Mexican food that reminds me of home. However, of the many restaurants that I have tried here in the valley, this one has been the closest and the best...so far.  The dish that I got could've served two people but the idea was to try a variety . The tamale was very good and the cheese enchilada was surprisingly even better. And being someone who never raves about Mexican rice, it feels a little weird saying that their rice stole the show. It was very good. Overall I was happy with the quality and taste.   I dropped in for lunch on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily there was an open area at the bar, where they had NFL games on 3 or 4 tv's. The bartender was extremely attentive, never letting my coke sit half empty and refilling my chips bowl a couple times, as well. I will return!
0	3axzWQhA1PR6fMI6Vdps9A	Good breakfast for sure!! Buuuut the service. Omg. Terrible!! Asked 2 times for a straw, water, a spoon and fork were dirty, one of the servers petted a dog and idk if she washed her hands... Then what blew my mind was a server has a cut on their finger and blood was exposed!! Will not be going back and would not tell somebody to visit.
0	7MBF5cOOTUvREAWvbIxZbw	I hate to give this bar and grill such a low rating, but the past few times I have been there, the service has been awful. My (now ex) girlfriend and I stood for 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to come and seat us. This would not have been such a problem had it not been 10 PM and there were only 2 tables with people at them. As far as food goes, it's not bad. Basic bar food, minus the pepper jack burger which is amazing. I will probably not be coming back to this location.
0	h21vUu3GyLwLuUbaX4lP2A	Had my very first sandwich from JJ's yesterday...and I'm sad to say I was really disappointed. I really, really wanted it to be awesome after seeing all the other reviews for the other locations.  To be fair however, I bought my sandwich (Beach Club) at about 5pm, stuck it in the fridge as wrapped, and ate it about 3 hours later after the gym. The bread was incredibly stale/hard in some places and the only thing that I could really taste was the mayo. The avocado spread was visible but flavorless, as were the turkey and rest of the filling.  However, I got the Vito for my son who ate it within 30 minutes of bringing it home and he said he enjoyed it and that the bread was fine.  Perhaps these are just the kind of sandwich you have to eat immediately?  Guess I'll need to give ol' JJ another chance but for now it's two stars. Yes, they did make them super fast--but probably too fast that they failed to recognize that one of the rolls was stale. Boo.
0	6prlcHgFo9JUYEaJKiZw8A	So I haven't been here in forever and recommended it for our Saturday night family dinner because it was amazing. Unfortunately it was better then than now. We waited an hour from when our whole party arrived to actual food in front of us. And when it did arrive, some dishes were cold (from waiting on the counter while the others were being made) and they weren't as good as I remembered. The Shenzhen chicken was super sweet, the Hong Kong noodles were bland as was the fried rice. The saving grace was the Teppan-Yaki beef. If all the dishes were as flavorful as the beef it would have been excellent. The waitress was sweet when she came around but ultimately drinks were not refilled without asking and I had to ask for chili sauce (to balance the sweetness) from the bar cuz she didn't check back with us. I probably won't be back, but will remember the restaurant as it was, and erase this dinner from my memory!
0	DceoSVqNPRPcpipxj6Uw	I didn't actually get to eat here because of the hostess, but I felt compelled to review as her indifferent attitude definitely put a damper on my night.    I showed up at 9pm, meeting some friends who were running late.  I informed the hostess that there would be 4 of us and she tells me "20-25 minutes."  Okay, no problem.  I'll stand at the awkward entry way and wait as my friends show up.  A couple who arrived at literally the same time as I did grabbed a couple of seats at the bar.  My friends show up a couple of minutes later and we wait 25 minutes.  During this time, the hostess is standing at the bar chatting with a waitress.  She never once talks to us or makes eye contact, or anything of the sort.  When 25 minutes have gone by, I try to get her attention about how much longer the wait will be and having failed, I resort to just going up to the bar and asking her.  She looks around and replies, "at least another 5 minutes. "  Well, thanks but that's really not helpful in the least.  "At least another 5 minutes" could mean anywhere between 5 minutes to more than an hour to who knows how long!  When I returned to my friends with this useless information, we decide to move on from this place and go elsewhere.  I went back to the bar to let the hostess know that we decided to leave instead of waiting, she cheerfully replies, "okay!"  I don't expect a super friendly hostess, but at least some display of empathy for the fact that we had waited half an hour already.  I just wanted her to say something like, "Yeah, I understand.  Sorry you waited all that time for nothing."   That would've made all the difference in the world.  Instead, she clearly didn't give two cents about us as patrons.  It certainly put enough of a damper on my night that I am not sure that I will try this place again to actually taste the food.
0	uQIHMNDrZZ3KmfXvN1keQA	Stopped in for some Gelato for my nephew since it was so hot out. I understand this stuff melts, but why did it seem like it was melting before she scooped it? the gelato did not look appetizing one bit.
0	jTIbdPdHFxfrBTBoL3FUpA	Overpriced is an understatement.  I was here for work and my boss paid so money personally was no issue but if i'm going to pay 50 bucks for carne asada it better be the best i ever had. It had no flavor or seasoning of any kind other than some salt?  The beans tasted like el pollo loco pinto beans and were covered in water.  I can't even believe the cost of something that plain.  17 dollar margarita?  Yeah i know its not authentic and all that but if i can get better mexican food for a 6th the cost off an east oakland taco truck.  There's a problem. Service was good though and the aria is a nice place to stay.
0	UuU11GIcfw4WFYxPUv9r4Q	I'll give this place kudos simply for the fact that it was open at 4:30 in the morning when my friends and I partook of some badly-needed sustenance.  We sat in the "outdoor" seating area which is next to the Paris Paris gaming area.  I had the grilled turkey sandwich which was big, filling, and good.  My friends had the steak and eggs and they said that it was the best that they had ever eaten at 4:30 a.m.  I'm not sure whether it was their stomachs or their heads that was doing the talking, but we left there full and happy and ready to enjoy more of the Vegas.
0	VfpIlD9lJPO6FjsLPr5mg	Leven's didn't do it for me. I was served a reasonable soup to start, but the fusion main course didn't work, at all. The food lacked pop and zing.  Overall, we said: "Leven's was disappointing. The welcome was bright, but the dishes were quite bland and muted. The service went beyond attentive in to obtrusive, at times, and once the main courses were done, we made a swift exit and went for tea in a lovely little place, two doors down. Leven's has attracted some serious adulation in some of its reviews, so I may well give it another visit, perhaps in the evening, to see whether I can figure out what went wrong, today. I'll make that a solo quest though, as on the basis of today's meal, I couldn't recommend the place to others."
0	zZw4AQzrDudMmTDFhWcSJg	Much like the whole of Princes Mall, the food court isn't anything special. The only thing it has going for it is it's convenient location to Waverly Station so if you're in a rush you can nip in and out before jumping on your train. In my case, I'll usually nip into Spud-u-Like which I think is the best of the bunch the food court has to offer and I can never turn down a baked potato with beans and cheese. Mmm.  If spuds aren't your thing then you can choose from the almighty Harry Ramsden's, McDonalds, Subway, KFC, O'Briens or Costa. Take your pick. The main downside, is the fact that this place feels like the most depressing shopping centre in the world so I wouldn't choose to eat here if I wasn't in a rush because it's not the nicest place to spend more time than you have to.

Chose from their big and darn good looking (wish I'd gotten one) salads ($7.49), their rice bowls (Full $7.59/Half $6.59) or one of their grilled sandwiches ($6.69) that include grilled chicken, pulled pork, jerk chicken and a few burgers.  They give you a number.  Sit down and they bring it to you.  We each got  sandwiches and paid the $1.99 extra for a side salad.  I liked my sandwich, but I think that side salad was my favorite part.  A really great dressing and super fresh greens (non-iceberg) were great, but the extra points went for the crumbled cheese and the honey crusted walnuts on top.  WOW!  That was not expected.  While our burger/pork sandwich were fine, I kept finding my self wishing I got a salad when I saw one being brought out.  I think I'll have to do that next time we're in the area because they really looked awesome - and huge!  Might have to split one of those and a bowl of their Bahama Mama Tortilla soup with coconut milk that caught my eye after I'd already ordered.  Mmmmm....

Read the receipt people!!  Also, ordered 4 ocean waters. Three were slushies and one was correctly made with Sprite and blue coconut. Seems like no one is checking orders for accuracy or quality.
0	55k6iPJpbSLFRGJ0vRRAFQ	Not the best plate lunch i've had.   But being that it is local and their prices definitely reasonable, i'll be back often.   I tried the katsu and garlic shrimp. The katsu sauce was kinda watered down but good nonetheless and the garlic shrimp was ok. I dont think ill get the shrimp again though. Just didn't seem worth it.   The BBQ mix plate is insanely huge and can easily feed 2 people, but being it was my first time here we got a bunch of stuff just to try out.  Next time its gonna be BBQ mix plate and the katsu.
0	K89tDYtIBxtV5R7WB5a9g	This was my first hibachi experience, so I had no expectations. I actually got sushi, and my friend got hibachi, though we did share.  Our chef was very entertaining, as well as making pretty good hibachi. The entertainment was fine, but here's what went wrong with the experience:  Sushi: Don't get me wrong, it was decent. However, EXTREMELY overpriced. I noticed that  they had normal prices for sashimi/nigiri, however it was just for one piece. $3.00 for one sweet shrimp? Seriously? Sweet shrimp are small! $2.50 for a piece of yellowtail? This is the most ridiculous pricing for sashimi/nigiri I've ever seen. I ended up getting a yellowtail roll and avocado roll (both very small for the price), and a spider roll. Though there was plenty of soft shell crab in it, it was extremely overcooked, which made it kind of unpleasant. Very disappointed on the sushi side of things.  Hibatchi: The salad and broth that came out before the meal were both very good. The person I went with was allergic to onions, and asked to just have white rice instead of fried. He was brought out a small cup of steamed white rice while everyone else at the table got a heaping portion of fried rice. The vegetables were fine, as was the steak. Like has been previously mentioned, cooked exactly to your specifications in front of you. The sauce that accompanied was also delicious.   All in all, it was okay. Kind of lackluster for a first hibachi experience, and definitely when compared to the price. Also, their sushi is just ridiculous and not worth what they're charging. I suggest going elsewhere for both venues of food.
0	LmEMFDlelP5gDGKXCcvVg	Dropped in this evening. The fish stew with red snapper was tasty. Really loved the collards and sweet potatoes. Would go back for them alone. Server was helpful and food was quick considering move was made to order.
0	QTDDQ3KCo4PoBJAIu8HIvg	"No. I don't want 5 guys. 5 guys are the guys who can't get no love from me. Servin' up some ok fries, but the price sky high.. ya won't hear no hollerin' from me!"  Between the sloppy staff, the hard to swallow prices, and the OMITTANCE OF CHEESE, which made my bacon burger even HARDER to swallow, this Five Guys location gets a whopping 2 stars. That being said, I think I would have been happier with a Whopper. The only redemption to this meal, which was had on really ugly tables, and super uncomfortable seats, was the glut of french fries. I allegedly had a hot dog too, but it was obviously quite forgettable, because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that "everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce..."  I'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere.
0	NbGjM98zBBMO4n6c2wBNQ	I love bagels.  I happened to go into Einstein Bro's because I was in Vegas to party and had to go to the bank (which happened to be right next to the bagel shop). I sent a friend in to get me an Onion bagel and he came out with a Plain because he said the onion bagels weren't ready.   I thought to myself "they weren't ready, whatever!!" So i contently took a bite of my plain bagel and realized why the Onion bagels weren't ready...its because they bake their bagels FRESH DAILY!! The bagel that was consuming (like it was my last meal) was the best bagel I had ever had.  The crispyness of the edges (toasted) to the soft inside and covered with a generous amount of cream cheese! WOW! Need I say more.? I was so impressed ..that I woke up early the next morning to grab another bagel before I headed back to LA!  THATS HOW DAMN GOOD THEIR BAGELS ARE!!!!
0	XM3BWAI51bzcWdrXiZnYxQ	One of my favorite new restaurants in Madison. A varied (warning to vegans: carnivore heavy!) menu with pleasant service and simple food that's clearly been made with care.  I've never been to South America so I can't make any claims on authenticity but we had a great meal that was something different from the standard ethnic fare.
0	9hxu3E7WrcDaj10LOoA	I've been ordering from this place for a couple months and have always loved the food however the customer service is severely lacking. After tonight I will no longer be ordering from this restaurant. The person taking my order could not get it right, the delivery took a half hour longer than expected, our order was incorrect when we got it and when we called them to tell them what was missing and wrong they said they weren't sure if someone could bring the missing/incorrect items. They will not refund anything but they will give a credit which does nothing since I will not order from them again.
0	CNSxoTO6wqhx5N0LoxAoKg	I'd give them a solid "we'd go back" The pot pie was very good, the salad was a bit above avg.  The service and staff were polite and helpful.  Kids meals were good, they were all full by the time we left.  We went on a Tue night for my birthday and still had to wait about 15 minutes.  Suggest hitting them before rush hour, as I expect on weekends in the west valley they are busy.
0	cpuPYduHKOUPpaU8yZ6A	A very unlikely place for me.  Off the strip and a dive bar to boot.  But, reluctantly went and was surprised at the food.  The ribeye was good and the special seasoning was very good.  I love that they do not overcook the meat (medium rare/rare-ish).  The steaks had a very good char on them too.  The meal came with a baked potato and some steamed broccoli.  All this for $12.99.  Service was on the slow side as only one waitress was there, but she was super friendly.  If you want to win in Vegas, go there.
0	GTzWXRfGUf78OZAdvrqPqQ	This place is overhyped. The lobster Mac and cheese is powdery and flavorless, the lobster roll needs salt and pepper and tastes strongly like rosemary, the lobster bisque is also not creamy enough and lacks that oomph that lobster bisque have. Not worth $10 for bisque and Mac & cheese, each. Also not worth $16 for the roll. The Lobsta Truck in LA is SO much better.... I am extemely disappointed...there weren't really sufficient seats in the area at Planet Hollywood. I gotta say, though, the service was really good and the staff was extra friendly. Two and a half stars. Didn't really do it for me.
0	k93y3vb4TU5xFvPTj9pMnQ	Truly one of the great collegiate spots for Mex-American cuisine!   I love chipotle. I loved it more after watching their documentary on Netflix. If I ever forget to bring my lunch to school, I usually come here for their bowls with a tortilla on the side. For my bowls, I usually get chicken because it's the cheapest, but I've had the sofritas too, which are pretty tasty (and cheap!). Love that they have brown rice options too now.   I think this is a great location because you can call ahead and pick up your order, if you're in a rush. It's true, this place usually gets high influx around normal eating times (12p, 5p) with all the array of interesting bodies Maryland Pkwy has to offer. One down side is that sometimes the staff are slow to clean up the tables, but it's a small issue for a reasonably priced, fresh, "fast food" go-to for college students like myself :-)
0	hYSINsDQFjA6CsqNYvFmA	Just went to this place last night and it's definitely a fun spot.  Everything is pretty much outdoors and the burgers are solid.  Lots of space, ice cold beers and totally reasonably priced.  Kinda out there, but it's odd that the Four Seasons is right across the street.
0	PB20dOCaTf7CCbshkbp0A	I was surprised. The food looked really good from afar, but it didn't taste very good. The food was bland, and missed a lot of oppurtunities to be an excellent dish. The burger patties were small and dry, and the Bleu cheese on the burger was more of a bottled dressing than the delicious sauce that was advertised. The pulled pork pouting was mediocre, the sweetness of the pork and slaw didn't mix very well with the generic fries and gravy the poutine offered. The onion rings were good but weren't worth the 6 dollar price tag. Service was excellent, however. Overall it was an OK experience, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it and I won't be going back.
0	Go2zqbaJg6TAN7VLyPWNA	I had high hopes when I saw an Asian fusion food truck on the ASU campus, but I was very disappointed with my first experience. I ordered the K-Pop tacos, since putting Asian fillings inside a taco was one of the best ideas anyone (i.e. Kogi in LA) has ever had. The filling at Fan Boy was quite good: marinated chicken in a Gochujang style sauce, green onions, sesame seeds and kimchee. Unfortunately, the filling was served in the worst stale, cold, dry, nasty corn tortillas I've had the displeasure of eating in a long time. They were complete garbage. Whoever thought it would be acceptable to serve tacos on that crap should be fired. Like serving a sandwich on stale bread, it doesn't matter how good the filling is. A bad tortilla ruins a taco. The filling was promising enough that I will still try Fan Boy again. Once. If the next dish has another huge flaw, I'm done with them.
0	DBoCe7aN3XoZMCjAcYHWDA	Thinking about going here for a before-show dinner some evening?  You might want to think again.  Gertrude's is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.  First: ambiance -- Gertrude's is located near the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  It still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  Besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, Gertrude's is incredibly noisy.  Strike one. Note: There is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.    Second: service -- the kitchen is way too slow.  We arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a 1/3-filled restaurant.  Our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  Thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  Thirty-five minutes after that I was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  Our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  In the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  Strike two.  Third: food - spotty.  For example, the pork trio had delicious thinly-sliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  The short ribs were blah.  The burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread (you need to order it separately for about $6) was a berry loaf of some kind that didn't work well with anything else we ordered.  That's right - no free bread.  Strike three.  Good points:  The price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  Too bad this wasn't fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  A couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  The Desert Botanical Garden itself is fabulous.  That's about it.  Sorry.
0	rZzShFX7K9RggCsP4yNQsg	Looking for authentic lao food? Look no furthur this place has it all. Whenever Im craving for larb seen(raw beef larb) tom kueng nai(organ soup) or gang dok mai(bamboo soup) I come to sisters market to get a fixing. I hate that its so far away from my house, but whenever I'm in the downtown area I'll drop by.           From the outside looks like a hole in the market, but don't let that fool you. The food is great and the owner is super cool! During lunch you'll see alot of local asian people dropping by for lunch ordering some mouth watering dish. If you're not into tripe and intestine soup theres regular pho, fried rice and plenty of other rice dishes available. I have a big family, so it could get pretty expensive but it's worth every penny as long as i'm not there everyday haha
0	HFrytlA80moKUCLEhoPJXA	I can't give a complete review because I only tried their espresso, but let me just say that the double shot I ordered was a pretty terrible espresso for an 'espresso bar'. I may not be an espresso expert, but I'm pretty sure that they are not supposed supposed to be sour. What I had was definitely under-extracted, and could've been pulled a few extra seconds. Everything happened so fast that I didn't even see the grind, dose, tamp, and pull, so I'm not sure if something else could've been a problem.  To their credit though, was that even in all its sourness, I could taste that the beans they used was amazing. Tons of character. They also have a great selection of direct trade beans.  Other than that, the decor was cool, and the atmosphere was amazing. However, that sour espresso made me feel that it's all hype.
0	AJiLwgVqhRgx0PNUlYsX4g	I don't normally remember, let alone call servers in restaurant by their names unless they do a phenomenal job.  Jon and Tony from Les Artistes are rare exceptions.  Friendly without being overbearing, knowledgeable enough to be able to make good suggestions and prompt with our orders (which was greatly appreciated given that some of us had shows to catch).    It has a feel of the real restaurant instead of just being some F&B establishment in amongst endless rows of slot machines (read: Wolfgang Puck @ MGM).  The prime rib was among the best.  So are their side dishes of creamed spinach and sauteed mushroom.  The one which stole the show is the create-your-own mashed potatoes... it gave me an opportunity to be a cook when I don't even know my pots from my pans.    A great find, even better with Tix4Tonight 50% discount.
0	dO612xC9RznalCSbltJU4A	This is a great take out place in Squirrell Hill (Murray & Hobart). We order from here almost every other week.  Almost always get the same dish-- Burmese Chicken Curry.  The great thing about this place is that they make every dish to order rather than premaking it... you can watch the cook make the food when you go to pick up.  They have good hot and sour soup too.
0	NogBjA1Md3bXOTjABGkbQ	I had pizza from here for lunch yesterday, courtesy of a friend who I helped move.  I'd also had some from the Lawrenceville location at an event I attended over a year ago, also gratis.  In both instances, I wasn't impressed by the quality or taste.  The pizza is your pretty nondescript, standard chain pizza (not thin crust, but not deep dish either), akin to pizza from national chains such as Papa John's, Domino's, etc.  I actually prefer Papa John's to Vocelli, since I like their sauce better (smoother and sweeter) and the garlic sauce that comes with the pies.  I can't comment on toppings, since both times, I had plain cheese pizza (which is my standard for judging pizza quality, anyway).  I also can't comment on the price or service, since I didn't order in either instance.  There's way better pizza to be had in PGH (see my pizza list for suggestions), so do yourself a favor and patronize a great independent pizza place--or even a decent chain pizzeria, such as Papa John's or Pizza Hut.  EDIT: In the Regent Square/Swissvale/Wilkinsburg area, I recommend Park Pizza and Cream on Braddock, which makes a far superior pizza, and also sells by the slice.
0	8VzM6cZcuQznXvni65vOQ	Really expensive for "fast food Mexican". We just moved by here and thought we woudl try it out after reading the reviews on here. It was SUPER salty (yes I eat a lot of Mexican food and LOVE spice, etc. I know Mexican food is salty in general so for me to point that out, means something). The only thing I like were the tacos. They were decent and not too bad actually. The enchiladas were mediocre at best and their rice and beans were plain and boring. Think I'll stick with Filiberto's. They are much cheaper and these two are equal on the playing field of fast food for Mexican food.
0	05ENadgDfAg5lvBlmIjfw	I guess this is one of the better sports bars in the Biltmore area but I still think it misses something... the bar is a great place to watch a game, but the main dining room lacks seats so that everyone can see the game.  While there are lots of TV's they tend to be on one wall so only half the table can see them...  The fat tire and Pyramid everyday beer special is great and the pictures on the walls are awesome... the food is decent... but I still think there could be more...  PS... the video in the bathroom is hilarious!!!
0	KRGctWzeV0QDbZRHWPjQ	This place wont be here long. I came in two nights ago because the Yard House had a wait. It looked okay from the outside beside the 30-something girls dirty dancing on eachother. I should have taken this as a warning sign. I was eventually greeted by a bartender who was hard of hearing. For the most part he was nice/friendly and frankly I felt bad for him. There was no one at the bar but me unless you count the waitress who laid down ON THE BARTOP where i was eating to get a shot done off of her.  I ordered a salad and a soup. Both were good, although there wasnt much meat in my soup. Together they were 11.00, which isnt bad.   This place caters to the 20-something college guy. Who in their right mind creates a place like this in a high-rent area?? The hostesses were 4's at best and were basically nude. The girls were all in bikini tops and shorts.  But whats the point of shaking you booty for no money??? I felt like they had no respect for themselves. Its one thing to be a go-go dancer, but I doubt any of those employees walks with more than 100 bucks.   WTF PART: Me eating my meal at the bar. Midway through, a waitress lays down ON THE BARTOP maybe 3 inches away from me and a group of guys do body shots off of her. There has to be a heathcode against some chicks body/hair being that close to my food while I am eating. There were a bunch of college guys taking pics of it of course so I am sure I am on some random dudes facebook page looking at my meal grossed out.
0	JlcjSppDXqUYoi6iC3czg	My least favorite location so far. I specifically asked for extra ingredients on my sub and somehow the guy only heard 50% of what I said, even though we went into detail explanation about said ingredients. I probably wouldn't be as upset if he choose not to hear the two ingredients they did put on my sub versus the two ingredients they didn't. In essence I paid for something I didn't want. I'm not surprised though, the guy that took my order looked high as hell. Next time I crave Jimmy John's I'll drive to a location that gets my order right.
0	GzGAp7tHqX8782R7DPUJZw	Well, that was a 200$ that I could have spent else where ! Went there with a group of friends, so we decided to start with a drink at the bar, about 30 minutes before our reservation - took about 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar, so we finish it at the table. At our table, 4 nice folding chairs were waiting for us, yup, folding chairs ! I mean, It's still a Zibo restaurant. I've would not have been surprised of this at la Casa Grecque, but at Zibo ?  Then, about 3 minutes after we were seated, waitress comes and ask us for what we've wanted to eat - not even offering something to drink or what kind of wine we wanted...when I asked for the wine list, I got some huge Rolling eyes telling me to hurry up my order.  Food was so-so. I think they forgot to put the taste in the calamars, Steak was cold, veggies were stiff.  So, I probably hit a bad evening for them. I think I would go again, but I would bring my own chairs !!!
0	tS1qr3G0jXpgBmf39n2mrQ	Place is pretty good, I havent had the food here, but some of the bouncers at the front are nasty, they say, " you gotta hit me with something if you wanna go in", even when they dont have a cover. The rating is exclusively for that.
0	VPEbuIQnb6SECEh08Tg	Yes, yes, yes. The Bougainvillea Cafe rocks my socks! I've never had a wait, service has never been too terrible (it's a diner, what more could I ask for), but the food ... man. They serve great breakfast and lunch items, including a quite tasty turkey sandwich on croissant, with fresh veggies and cheese. But the best time to go is after 11pm, when the grave specials start. You can get four eggs, cooked to your liking, potatoes, toast, and a nice, THICK, lean steak, for $4.99. You can't get a steak this good a la carte anywhere else for less than $5. Do what you will with the eggs, potatoes, and toast. The steak, in my experience, has always been superb. And if you order it rare, my friends, they will serve it to you with a PULSE. I LOVE IT.  Something bizarre happens to me when I eat (or apparently even think about) a nice, big, juicy piece of steak. It's very primal.  Now, I have to mention ... they also have an item on the menu referred to as "Giant Biscuit 'n Gravy." It's not a big order, it's literally a huge biscuit, the size of your head, smothered in that yummy, creamy sausage gravy.   They do offer a "Part of the Orient," Chinese lunch specials. They run from 11am 'til 2pm, and $5 will get you egg drop soup, steamed rice, and your choice of entree. I recommend you just skip that page in the menu, though.
0	OuTwdZeaR8WWraxAXKdHw	For the price this place is decent, I wouldn't say the food is bad by any means but it could definitely use some help in some areas. The fried rice is tasty but lacks some bbq pork or some other kind of protein for me. The orange chicken is quite tasty and the flavor is good. The egg flour soup is mediocre at best, i've definitely had better. The service isn't great but it isn't awful either, they could be a bit more attentive. They were good about getting our order taken quickly and the food came out in a timely manner. but once we were served our main dish we didn't see the staff again for a little while. Usually I expect that they at least come back within10 mins of serving the food to ask how things are or to check for refills and clear the table of the empty dishes. They did none of that. On the upside they do deliver on the base, which for me is a bonus. I think in the future that if I did choose this place again that I would order out and take it home or have it delivered.
0	gVTzqsxqF1bzUme4mpog	Like the Arby's commercial (which I love), meeeeee likey.  When I lived in CA, I frequented CJ quite a bit and never had a disappointing meal.  I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.    I was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!    While waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole "normal" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.  If you haven't been to CJ, you're in for a treat.  Just save room for the chocolate mother lode cake!
0	xCSFDTn4BW3rgOGTMbgTMA	My hubby and I went there For the first time a couple months ago. We were both not really impressed at all with the food or even the service. It wasn't horrible bit we both agree we will likely not be back. The atmosphere was a little too dark for dinner. The patio seemed nicer but we ate inside the dining room.
0	wWxKDuh3BXN7RiCLJQyRg	Was just here for the Valentine's Day special :  1 x Choice of soup or salad 1 x Steak (Top Sirloin) + Lobster (one half stuffed)  1 x Vegetables / Potatoes 1 x Dessert (Chocolate mousse topped cookie)  all for $29.95  I started with the seafood corn chowder soup, my date had the caesar salad. Both were fine.  Steaks were good. They were VERY thick cuts and were quite tasty for top sirloin.  Lobsters were great. Succulent and tender, the stuffing was really yummy.  The dessert was also very good.  $29.95 + $29.95 - $25.00 Restaurant.com coupon = $35.00  Print out a coupon and go there now.
0	4XNlFqp1vqqHIbFEU1xfg	I am fortunate as I live next door. I love the outside patio on a beautiful evening.  The happy hour is outrageous!  The bartenders and waiters are friendly and knowledgeable. The food is phenomenal and the prices are so low.  I love that this place is my neighborhood bar.  In my opinion, if you are looking for old school style and sophistication, this is the place for you.
0	4I57gPR5A1eOsOlZbzbbA	Fresh may be a bit of an overstatement. I got a veggie burrito which at most places cant be screwed up. Out of all my burrito experience, this as at the bottom.   The rice was mushy and not ricey. The "hot" salsa had a nonexistent flavor and the whole thing was a floppy disappointment. I should have remembered the Quizno's around the corner.  Maybe, if you are super hung over and all you need is a bad burrito, give it a shot. I (for any state I am in) will choose a delicious veggie sandwich from Quizno's instead.
0	D4PJesLMJextnDv4hQAs6A	// Update: 25.08.2014  Allgemein  Unser erster Besuch um "Sokrates" wird wohl auch der Letzte gewesen sein. Griechische Gastfreundschafltichkeit war nicht erkennbar und es vergingen satte 90 Minuten von der Bestellung bis zur Lieferung der Hauptspeise. Dieser Zeitraum ist schlicht und ergreifend eine Zumutung. Au\u00dfer ein paar entschuldigende Worte bei der Rechung gab es hierf\u00fcr auch keinerlei Wiedergutmachung.  Bedienung  Die wenigen Bedienungen waren bei den zahlreichen G\u00e4sten v\u00f6llig \u00fcberlastet. Die Aufmerksamkeit gegen\u00fcber den G\u00e4sten war nicht vorhanden, eine Kontaktaufnahme war somit nicht m\u00f6glich. Wir wurden konsequent ignoriert, was auch nicht durch nachtr\u00e4gliche Entschuldigungen wieder gutgemacht werden konnte. Ich habe ja schon viel mit erlebt, aber das war bisher mein negatives Highlight.  Das Essen  Der Bauern-Salat zum "Spezial-Teller" war entt\u00e4uschend. Die Zutaten an sich waren frisch, aber leider wurden diese Bestandteile in Oliven\u00f6l ertr\u00e4nkt. Irgendeine Art von Dressing konnte ich auch nicht herausfinden.  Die Hauptspeise war schlecht bis gar nicht gew\u00fcrzt. Einzig die Kartoffeln und das Lamm waren schmackhaft verfeinert. Das Fleisch hatte auch eine gute Qualit\u00e4t. Zum Essen bestellten wir noch ein extra Tzatziki, welches etwas lieblos pr\u00e4sentiert auf einem Teller serviert wurde.  Das Ambiente  Die Lokation hat einen gro\u00dfen Innen- wie auch Au\u00dfenbereich, was leider viel Lautst\u00e4rke mit sich bringt. Die Einrichtung ist eher modern als typisch griechisch eingerichtet, aber wirkte gut erhalten.  Sauberkeit  Zum Thema "Sauberkeit" gab es nicht zu beanstanden - alles war soweit im Normalbereich. Lediglich ein paar kleine Getr\u00e4nker\u00e4nder der Vorg\u00e4nger auf dem Tisch waren erkennbar.
0	zNBPhwBlDs8JSxyIDerQg	All I can say is you get what you pay for and for around $7 I got a lot. All the times I've been to Vegas, I've never ventured off the strip but thanks to some kababayans, they recommended this place after a couple of days of overpriced food options elsewhere.   They had a lot of different options, but I chose the ones I was more familiar with like pancit, fried chicken, kare kare (my fav, but my mom's is still the best!), sinigang, and lots and LOTS of sisig. I know it wasn't the most healthy choice, but this is Vegas and I would pay the $7 just to eat a plate of sisig.   I took my Vietnamese friend here and even he had more than 3 plates of food. Along with the halo-halo, I would say my $7 was well spent. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the city.   If you're looking for a five star restaurant, go spend $30-$75 somewhere else.
0	P0yeSnOvpQO8wyxn2DOvQ	I go to the williamsburg arms in order to understand how good other places are.  It doesn't have great beer, it is mostly a cheap lager place with a few other taps that never even approach interesting.  Tankhouse is their most interesting beer.  Foodwise, it is good to take kids too, but make sure the kids aren't hungry because service is notoriously slow and always has been.  Food is acceptable though and it is the kind of food that kids love, which is also the sort of food that is good for watching sports, and there is usually 3-4 tvs of sports on at any given time.   It is usually soccer.  I give a 2 because i've never gotten sick from eating the food, and neither has any of my friends that I know of, and the food is perfectly edible and normal.

And we were looking for a great Italian experience in Vegas, and after checking out pricing, menus and reviews, we went for Ferraro's even though we'd been to the same area for nearly every other meal.....but the Strip restaurants were either chains or way overpriced and not much authenticity in the menu.  Restaurant is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  Host staff were extremely friendly, and made us feel special from the moment we walked in.  Our waiter, Eric, was super nice, very knowledgeable and creative with menu recommendations.  He helped us with great wine choices, and even offered to give me samplers of two dishes I couldn't decide between.  Really was an enjoyable evening, and we enjoyed knowing that we were supporting a local Vegas family-owned operation.  It was definitely worth a special occasion meal, but also friendly enough for two friends to just enjoy an evening together and not feel out of place.

The food here is always fresh and different with a surprising turn that you don't always expect.  The charcuterie is great and the selection of wine complements it well.  The bread is fresh baked and amazing.  Every entree is delicious with a twist.  Is not the best value for the food, and the wait can be a bummer.
0	7r1jCyQMWcmbvs2TNbhleg	My office is right by J&L Grill so I watched the construction with great anticipation. Yes! A new lunch/happy hour spot. Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to keep searching for a "close to the office gem."   A friend and I stopped in on a Wednesday night for dinner. Though the restaurant was nearly empty the service was still somehow very slow. There were 2 other people sitting at the bar and we still had to flag down the bar tender to try and get a drink or place our order. I think the best way to describe the atmosphere of the restaurant is cold. Yes, its shiny and new and there are plenty of televisions, but its more sterile than inviting.   During happy hour they offer $.25 wings and $2 domestic drafts; that's exactly what we had. The wings were "meh". They were small and tasty enough, but they weren't anything special. We tried the "Brush Fire" (buffalo ranch), the "Bayou Cajun" and the "Medium Buffalo". The "Brush Fire" was fine but the other two much closer to bad than good. Looking over the rest of their menu I noticed that the prices are all quite high considering fries must be purchased on the side. Most sandwiches and burgers are $10, fries are $2.75 and an average beer is $3-5. You're looking at $20 for a burger, fries, beer, and tip, that's rather steep if you ask me.
0	SZRERRqlbHefiwi4F1wjpg	Not really very good at all.  I went there for a "Real Redhot" and they even have signs of them in the place, but guess what, they don't sell them!  Long wait for mediocre food. Al's Beef is better  Oh yeah, and they fill your drinks and there is no drink station, so forget about ice or a refill.  I won't be going back any time soon.
0	b8Kwx5WnvOEEcHAB8xqYWw	Anytime I can get all you can eat sushi, I'm a happy camper! The service here was excellent and for $27 AYCE sushi the pricing isn't bad either. However, this place is getting a 4 because the sushi could have been better. Although the ambiance at Blue Fin isn't as nice as Fukuda, the freshness of the fish and the flavors of the specialty rolls were much better.
0	4WXDL0yXqIcwhkzPUbyZQA	doesn' get any better than this. If you want some real barbeque, this is the only place to get it. I come here every time I go to Vegas, and something about this place gives me that warm and comfy feeling. The ribs are amazing, mainly because fo the way they smoke them ( i believe its a few weeks?, not to sure). The sauce is unbeatable and the fried okra, is perfect. The portions are also pretty good, not too much. If you dont eat pork, I dont necessarily suggest this place. If you try this place, you wont be sorry!
0	UUYYBblXsM32fBLci0yKw	Pros: Taste Freshness Service Cleanliness  Cons:  The place was empty. Did I miss something?  Overall, the food was great. Probably the best shrimp fried rice that I have had. They also give free cho mein noodles and sweet and sour sauce to snack on ehile your order is being prepared. Business was slow, we were the only ones in the restaraunt for the hour that we were there. Most likely do to location and we were there on a Sunday night. I will eat at this gem in the rough again!
0	4Mme9u4amMsrowO5MTyTA	Great food, nice portions, and a smooth experience until I found a long curly hair in my nachos! Waitress seemed to not believe me and showed me a bit of attitude afterwards. Hopefully they are a bit nicer if we choose to go back..
0	aNhkFMLB8tL7Ru8MerVEQ	This place is a joke. The pricing is too high, and the quality is sub-par, at best. Honestly, it's the laughing stock of any and all actual Chicago pizza joints. I refuse to eat anything from here, but none of my friends will listen to me.  A few of them ordered a "deep dish" on Friday, from this particular location, with a 20% off coupon, and it came to us FAR from deep. It was really more of a thick crust with greasy cheese on it. Also- another friend purchased one of their Rosatis-brand jars of giardineria. I had to try it, because it's one of the things I miss most about Chicago, and I figured they couldn't screw it up. Man, was I wrong.  A: it was neither spicy, nor hot, despite what the label said, and...  B: it tasted like I was eating canola oil, straight.  Judging by the see-thoroughness of the paper plate I scoped the littlest bit on to, I believe that I did. Gross. Go out of business already, and quite making fat old people, all the more fat.
0	i8uDJbwIiO1WTf9fJxAl2g	Needed something to eat on a short layover.  Everything except Pizza Hut Express was closed and even this place was near closing.  Unfortunately, the buns didn't look so fresh, but I got one anyway.  I've had Cinnabon before and I love them, but by the time these things are exposed to airport fumes, they must go bad just like every other airport food court food.  I ate the stale thing while waiting to board my next flight.  I wished I had a couple shots of grand marnier to wash it down.  You really must get these things when they are fresh.  Lesson learned.
0	DEL0edE6yQxeF8YFBelG9A	Got philly steak sandwich, it tasted good. Bread was alright . Nothing great about the sandwich. But, wow the portion size is really small. I left the place really hungry. It's less than subway 6". Not coming back! If sandwich was bigger and filling, I would give it 4/5 star. Not to mention Tea ran out and had to use lemonade for refill, that I hated all night!
0	S7ptAyABimHWrlZH5Lxw	The service here was good, the food came out fairly quickly, but I don't see myself going back here anytime soon.   First of all, the prices are all about $1 more in the store than their online menu. Not a big deal, but for the price we paid, I would expect better quality food! My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things off the menu to split and I was not blown away by any of it.  A steak "platter" was $11.50. I thought it was a good deal until it showed up. It came with about 5 tiny pieces of steak and the rest of the plate was covered with lettuce, tomato, a few pieces of pita, a huge serving of dressing and a side of fries. It sounds like a lot of food, but what it turned out to be was barely any meat and a bunch of cheap fillers taking up all of the space on the platter! Those platters are extremely overpriced.  The rice in the grape leaves was still kinda hard and the baklava seemed like it was a few days old...a little soggy and not flaky at all! The cheddar balls were ok, but it is difficult to mess up deep friend cheese!  They have a prime location right in market square, so I was quite shocked at how disappointing their food was!
0	b8nVhJu3ieMr6Xe1OHDFg	Decent sushi. However, they take for ever to deliver (over an hour in my case) so maybe take out is a better option. Also, make sure you double check your order with them on the phone because they're prone to mistakes.
0	MPgSBvgDbsUi7wEspyG0ZA	You would think a simple order of 4 cheese burgers plain and a large onion ring would be easy but apparently not, after telling the cashier taking the order 3 times they ha to confirm the order 2 more times.  Spend a few extra bucks and hit up smash burger
0	iH6h7r9hY82fdkHyo1rNMA	My husband and I really wanted some good old fashioned barbeque after living overseas for awhile, but this place just didn't do it for us.   Sure the ribs were OK, but just OK, and the beans and coleslaw were just that as well.....OK. The service was friendly and at least and the place was clean, oh, and don't forget the free popcorn while you wait.....but this still doesn't make up for a not so good rib/barbeque experience. We won't be back and won't be recommending this place to family or friends.
0	3VVTlri0SWg0skvZHlWgQ	"Expensive, below average, small portion sushi" 2/5  We were excited about this new sushi place close to our home last week and decided to give it a try. When we walked in the restaurant around 6pm, we were the first group of customer in the restaurant. The server was nice by taking our seating us and taking orders.   We chose 3 types of sushi rolls - cucumber roll, special roll with salmon and cream cheese and an eel roll. My sis ordered a chicken-katsu. The rolls were pretty disappointing as they were very small rolls in size and not much of raw fish (sashimi) on top. It tasted like something that you could have gotten from the grocery store sushi section but a lot more expensive at Big Eye. One special roll is about $13 to $15 (only tiny 5-6 slices). My sis's chicken-katsu tasted better than sushi but the price was a bit steep as well ($12 or $13). I guess this is Scottsdale price! Oh well, we had definitely tasted better sushi with the same price.   I would not recommend this place to any friends but might give it a try again in a year or two.
0	Iih4EaDJNwrQkKDDo25ycQ	WHAT A DIFFERENCE from the Chandler location to the Snottsdale location! The food is still unbelievably good, but here it comes with prompt service, accurate orders and fresh-showered, healthy/vibrant looking employees.  After this weekend I think I'd be happy to drive the 45 minutes to this location rather than the five minutes to the Chandler location for my Pita Jungle fix.
0	kb4ZTU0TAIVeTNce8fkng	My mom is obsessed with this place! Needless to say I've been force fed Carlos most of my life, but you know what it's pretty good! There is nothing super special about this place, but the food is reliably good so I like that. I would recommend going in for their lunch specials or after a long day at work. My mom is particularly obsessed with their margaritas so try to stop by for happy hour if you can. Good chips and salsa too which is muy importante.  Careful for long waits at night!
0	mGyt1lwrXNmvwNf4FMBefQ	I love coming here to get the baby back ribs, pulled pork, collard greens, potato salad, corn bread, and fried okra.  The meat falls off the bone and is just easy to devour.  I had their chicken too and found the dark meat more desirable than the white meat.  To appreciate the white meat, I needed to dip in to the barbecue sauce, which by the way has a zing to it.    The pulled pork sandwiches are also to die for.  I'm not normally a fan of pork, but I'll eat it here over other places that serve it.
0	vGUkJDhllygOUNVix3vyuA	Okay, I'm going to admit it, I'm a huge fan of "Hell's Kitchen," and frankly, the reason why we ventured off the Strip to go to this restaurant was because the winner from Season 2 of HK, Heather, won a job there.  Yes, the food was AMAZING.  Heather didn't work there anymore but the the food was still A-MAZ-ING.  When you sit down, they start you off with a selection of breads and a mini antipasto plate with artichoke hearts, a hunk of good parm cheese, these to-die-for Queen olives and grilled bell peppers.  MMMmmmMMM!!!  We started with the beef carpaccio and green bean salad.  The beef carpaccio was excellent and the green bean salad was a nice, refreshing contrast to our later, heavier pasta dishes.  I would definitely recommend the beef carpaccio.  Yummy.    The green bean salad was good but not something that would knock your socks off.  It was basically blanched green beans on iceberg lettuce, with shaved palm hearts, small pear tomatoes and a light lemon vinagrette.  You could make that at home.  Let me just rave about the pasta, though!  My hubby's rigatoni with spicy sausage and peas was very good but my pasta?  OMG.  Let me say that again.  OMG.  I can't remember the exact name of the pasta it but they're basically half-moon shaped raviolis that are filled with this marscapone cheese and osso bucco mix.  Did I say OMG.  OMG.  My first bite was HEAVEN.  I literally was silent for the first several bites as I savored the complex flavors and textures of the pasta.  OMG.  'Nuff said.  I wish I could have ordered dessert but we were so stuffed from the generous portion sizes.  I was more full from that meal than from the Paris Hotel buffet that we went to the night before.  Now, with that said, I gave the place 4 stars because the service was weird.  We're at this fine dining establishment but the wait staff seemed to be culled from a casual dining restaurant (or even less).  I'm all for women's lib but when it comes to fine dining, I like to be treated like a lady.  So how weird was it that I was given the bill and not my husband (nevermind the fact that my lovely husband did all the right chivalrous things like pull out my chair, order my meal for me, refreshed my other drinks from the bottle--just follow his lead!)?  And then why was it that we were waited on by our waiter AND a busser but still had to ask for my water to be refilled?  And how did our waiter forget what the specials were for the evening?  Or why was our candle never relit after it blew out half-way through our salad course?  And why was it that when the waiter took my knife with my salad plate, that he never brought me a replacement?  Or that he took my bread plate but not my husband's? Or that they cleared my husband's plate while I was still eating my entree?  Sadly, the weird service took away from the entire meal experience.   Also, note to the owners...waiters in jeans with a collared shirt and tie?  Yeah, no.  Jeans just don't work well for fine dining.  I think what killed it for us (and why we probably won't make the drive out there again) is that the waiter poo-pooed Heather from HK.  Yes, we had to ask b/c we're dorky that way.  He said, "It was just a publicity stunt. She only had a year contract and was out literally to the day that her contract expired.  She couldn't cook anyway."  Wow, that was a major disappointment.  At least lie to us and tell us that she was great and that she's moved onto new ventures?  It's not that we didn't enjoy the food but since there are so many great restaurants on the Strip, we didn't need to make that 20-minute drive all the way to Red Rock Resort when we could walk 5 minutes to one of Mario Batali's 2 new restaurants at the Palazzo.  Bottom line: Great to eat there if you're already in that part of town.  Otherwise, not completely worth the drive out there when there are comparable places on the Strip.
0	VkWXmm7BpOzK3qeJeA	My first visit was about 7-8 months ago and I still go maybe once every week or two, JUST to get boba though.  I've tried the teriyaki bowl and it was mediocre... I guess for the price it wasn't bad, but the overall taste was bland. Seems like I could have gotten the same food quality from a microwavable teriyaki dinner.   I think the boba is above average, if that. I always get the coconut milk tea with boba. It's really cheap in comparison to other boba places where their small sizes are the same prices as the HUGE size you get at BeeGee, though the milk tea is a bit watered down. Really I keep going here because it's a pit stop before heading to work and the drive-thru makes it very convenient to satisfy my boba cravings on the go.  I'm not quite sure what to say about service. They aren't really friendly, but they've never been rude either. I came almost everyday for two weeks being helped by the same guy who not once acknowledged I was a regular in any sort of way. I found that odd especially because each time I tipped $1-$5 depending on the amount of drinks I ordered. It gives you the "McDonalds feel" where you're quickly pushed out because they are slammed, except they aren't busy. Ever.
0	C22dlNYvSHbqTeTWK7U4iA	The difference between Don Tortaco and Roberto's?  Virtually nothing at all. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out the owners of the two similar franchises were siblings just competing against each other. They use practically the same ingredients and all the foods taste/look/seem the same, just claimed by a different franchise tag.  Blindfold me and bring carne asada fries from each place and I won't be able to tell you the difference. Just like Roberto's, Tortaco's meats are mediocre. Way too grilled and doesn't even take like authentic carne asada. I'm not Mexican but I lived on Mexican food so I know what my asada and pastor tastes like~  Despite its annoying similarities, it's not bad. It's worth going to here and then but nothing special. I would go maybe if I was intoxicated enough and since it's close to me.
0	fn8BVMv346SsyrlKptdEew	Hate to say this, but my food was awful.  Cornbread and gravy was very good but the smothered chicken was awful,  it was tough and dry.  The blackeyed peas tasted like they were straight out of a can, no seasoning, had to keep adding salt and pepper to everything.  Plus they had no greens!!   Soul food place with no greens??   Had cabbage instead; it was horrible, swimming in water, no seasoning.  Potato salad was awful. I will give them a second chance. Hopefully it will better.
0	5kYgAtG5dtDeQpno6IPUw	I love this place.  There aren't many Korean/Chinese style places here in Vegas.  The Jjampong (Spicy Noodle Soup) is really good here along with the Jjajang myun (Black Soybean noodle).  The Chinese food isn't bad either.  The service is friendly, and the price is decent.  It might not be the most decorative place inside, but the food is still very good.  Korean/Chinese style is different from just Korean and Chinese.  However, I think generally people will still like this type of food.
0	bhvp4RThvRmCK21n06IZg	This place is very good.  I've been here many many times and can attest to it being consistent too.  There's a variety of Italian dishes, salads, appetizers, and personal size pizzas.  It whoops up on anything in a 5 mile radius for Italian.    I'm a personal fan of their rigatoni smoked chicken entree. Other contenders are the Tortellini Principesa, the gnocchi with blush sauce, and the 4 cheese pizza.  They often offer a fresh seafood entree special, which will always be fantastic.    The owner Vince is ultra nice and is usually chef'n it up in the back, so quality control is top notch.  They also have Bira Morreti on tap.
0	wtGBzTRUvjJdANsHUHuIKA	Stopped in for Sunday night dinner late and had the chicken I'd heard so much about.  Fantastic.  Others in my party had more traditional bistro dishes and all were satisfied.    Can't discuss the noise issue too much since the place was pretty much empty at 10 PM on a Sunday but I'll be heading back for sure.
0	Lc1BB063vLxkcfVbEECoA	Came here for a late lunch. The ordering concept was interesting, the decoration was appropriate and in theme, but unfortunately the food was quite disappointing.   I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was chewy not tender. It felt like it had been cooked and then forgotten on the counter and dried out. The flavor was there, but the texture and moisture wasn't. Disappointing. Same with the fries. They had already been cooked and were simply deep fried a second time. They tasted oily and were very soggy. Not something I look forward to in a frie. I tried my gfs BBQ pork ribs: again it tasted good flavor wise, but seemed very dry.  Overall, the BBQ flavor was great, but the food wasnt.
0	Ml6TQc2xxOmfYeSL3pk1g	They have good food.  It's unique.  It's got some strong flavors goin' on.  There are some things two weeks later your tongue will start telling you you need to have again, soon. Don't go in thinking "We're having Chinese".  Go in thinking, "We're having P.F. Chang's" and half the battle will be over. The only problem I've had is, we never have enough room at the table for all the plates of food that show up.  Did we order too much or is the table too small?  Maybe they need to install food parking garages so you have 3 or 4 floors of food storage at your table.  That would help. The mini-desserts are an inspiration from Satan.  You think you're full.  No, no, I don't want dessert.  But they have a "mini-dessert"!  It's just $2!  You can just have a little bit!  Well, ok, in that case...
0	2EGtHt3B2vGPtSw9trb1A	Shrinking portions + So-So Baked Goods + Friendly Service  Stopped by for lunch at this Paradise Bakery as it was the choice of our daughter on her birthday. Very friendly staff, but I was surprised how every little thing seemed to have a special charge. Heart cookie instead of chocolate chip? Extra $2. Cheese on ham sandwich? Add $0.50. Croissant bread instead of sourdough? $0.75 additional, yo! Even the staff complained about the menu changes last year and having to nickle and dime customers.  On top of everything, the baked goods aren't as tasty we recalled. My wife complained about the severe lemon flavor in the heart cookie. Chocolate chip cookies we so average that none of us finished ours. And we NEVER leave cookies unfinished!  At least the food was good. Small servings mind you, but maybe they are hinting that we Americans eat too much and need to adjust our portion sizes down. Fair enough if that's their aim.
0	OEkV9iX2zHvmmXoG9HbPNA	By far my favourite Subway! Their tables are always clean, as are the windows. They always have what I want to order.   Sometimes they run out of bread, and sometimes the worker's friendliness isn't the best, but overall it's a great place for me and a couple friends to hang out.
0	FiqOqpiRTjavtJtXOacA	It's alright. Tastes exactly like heat-up PF Changs but the thing I didn't like the most was that when I ordered fried-rice, it was extremely apparent that they just threw some soy sauce in the white rice steamer and spooned it out a couple minutes later. It was probably because we ordered at around nine in the evening so maybe they didn't want to make another big thing of actual fried rice, but I would have rather they told me it would take a while to make more actual fried rice and I would have chosen something else as a side. Anyways, when you're leaving the movie theater and you didn't want to pay seven dollars for popcorn, it's an alright place to grab some quick chinese. Even if it just tastes like mediocre PF Chang's.
0	Rb5SkevGGMB23zIAKJW1g	It seems like eating in is the way to go- delivery is not.  A few friends ate at the restaurant and liked it so much we had pizza delivered -twice.  The delivery was on time, but both times a big disappointment.  Just bad; I didn't eat it either time.
0	R9WCyWWFExOsu5qxlga0w	Although I've only been to Lisa G once, the service at the bar was great, the food was excellent (I had the Juno sandwich), and the atmosphere was fine.  I look forward to going back soon.  UPDATE: Ok, I've been back to Lisa G several times now with a friend who works in the area.  I must say, I really like the food.  So does my friend.  It's quality stuff, what can I say.  Everyone is friendly; I've never come close to the experience that Nadia C. had.  Although I think she overreacted.  In the owner's defense, she has a small area in the front of the restaurant that she requests people use for meetings after they've finished eating and only if there's a wait.    Since my first visit, I've ordered the Juno again (super yummy!) and Lisa's award winning balls.  I must say, they were quality balls.  My taste buds prefer sweeter balls, but these were really good.  You can tell a lot of love went into making these balls.    When I go I usually drink Voss sparkling water, but they do have an interesting soda collection (as was mentioned previously) that I look forward to sampling in the near future.  I highly recommend you try it at least once.  You can be the judge if it's worth returning to.  I know I'm a repeat customer.
0	3dkvt0c7uotvclMDpcVsw	Conchas are great. Delicious and fluffy. I was surprise they weren't dry since I got them at 2 pm. I got 7 pastries for $6 not bad. I was going in to get conchitas (the mini Conchas) they unfortunately do not make them :(
0	KH9SV3WhKamcy7vV6YfLg	This place is home of the steamed bagel.  All the bagels are steamed and wrapped in tin foil like a burrito (which is the easiest way to eat them).  The menu is full of delighful combinations, one of my favorite is the Sweet Thursday- cinnamon raisin bagel, egg, swiss cheese, and tomato, I know it sounds wierd but it's delicious.  The chicken salad is also pretty good.  The sandwiches are large but they aren't cheap- look for the special of the day.
0	VSmp5lPCqVDFn1stZrWfgg	Not an attractive place to eat at but the foods really good here. Got the meatballs strombol/calzone whatever they called it but it was was the best one of those I've ate, right out of the oven (about 15 mins to make), everything from the dough shell that kept it all together, chunks of mozzarella, meatball, marinara, onions and pepper was delicious.  it was pretty good size too for about $8.  I ate half and was stuff, enjoyed it that much that an hour later i finished the rest no matter how full i was.    They have a pretty good lunch special menu of 13 choices ranging from about $6-9 all including drinks.  Located close to sunset park, if i had more time i would've ate it at the park outside in the sun. Stromboli took around 15 mins to make so I would order by phone first. Everything else they usally make quickly.
0	UKjsSFSfZb08bCnkuoHnQ	You only have 1 chance to make a good 1st impression. Your front of the house needs some help. After asking me 3 times my order to go was still wrong. Asked for no mayo or tomatoes. There was so much mayo the sandwich didn't even taste of anything other than mayo. This was not a prep issue this was an ordering issue. They couldn't print a receipt because they had the paper loaded wrong. They got that fixed just as I was leaving with my order. After I got home and found out how screwed up my order was I realized that it was because it wasn't taken correctly in the first place. You have been open for a month, you should be running smoother than this. Good luck I probably won't be back. There are many sandwich places competing for my $$$, I am not sure that Cousins will be in the mix. Sad because I think their quality is probably pretty good, but if you can't get an order right I am not gonna like it no matter how good it is suppose to be.
0	ZOkCKwO2TezeRqA7bFYqg	Exactly what you expect from a Chinese buffet; I've had better but the convenience makes this place a great eat. I can't really complain when it comes to all you can eat, depending on how greedy you are, you can definitely get more than your money's worth. Staff are fast and friendly, and I've eaten here with various company more times than I care to remember. There was one occasion when my sister and I were asked to pay before we ate along with about 10 other tables, all young people, which we did but opon thinking about we queried and were told that they ask young people to pay before eating on Saturday (she's 19, I'm 21) - we asked for a refund in offense before eating, but were refused. That has put a sour note on my feelings towards the establishment, and although this definitely is policy as I've heard the same from others, I believe it's an unfair one.
0	i0ak3J8ETyNQu1iKA33Dhg	This is the original Andre's restaurant not the one in the Monte Carlo.  Andre himself prefers this location.  The decor is very simple and as another reviewer accurately describes as "country french".  Our server was excellent and the sommelier was very helpful selecting our wine.  The food while very good was not good enough given the price range of the restaurant to give it 5 stars.
0	AaMNqGkfqKOHgh5Lpaeufg	We had reservations and we were late. I hate being late but I was not in control of our group that night so there you go. But even though we were late they greeted us with a smile and still had our table waiting.    We then were greeted by the wait person, a very nice woman with a great smile. She took our drink orders and appetizers .It all came very quickly. But it did not feel we were being rushed in any way.   I honestly can not remember what we all ordered for the actual dinner. But I do know it was VERY good. I was surprised in that we have had a recent string of crappy meals in other places that this is what I was expecting. But lucky for us we all truly enjoyed our food and time.    This was a few weeks ago and it is time to go back ;-[)
0	9cEuc2x1NWDqLgEUDqfFTw	No the Kung Pao chicken is not awesome (colon ,open bracket). This is the staple americanized chinese cuisine with one base sauce ( soy,sugar,rice vinegar, garlic) and just simple deviations to obtain the various dishes.   You will get the same stuff at Panda express or any other generic americanized chinese eatery. Base your need to visit on the price differential if you want.  I also enquired about some of the dishes in order to acertain any hidden "special" (read authentic) dishes, but was sadly dissapointed.  Extra star(as ususal) for Mom-Pop eatery.
0	fekmTI0A9mCSCZ5jnBozw	Great Food and friendly atmosphere.  Have a nice menu with lots of choices - sandwiches, salads, steaks, etc....had fish & chips which was excellent.  Lots of regulars playing video poker at the bar.  Music selection was outstanding, 90's alternative and 80's Rock!  Great bartenders and service!
0	VAqodLGFWeAUOf14qCA9iQ	Didn't eat but was lured by an impressive Tequila lineup.  They had our favorite (Casa Nobles Anejo).  But the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita.  I asked for a Grand Marnier float and he poured it in the shaker after the tequila.  The mixes they used were mediocre at best.  The drinks were  $14, similar ones would hit $18-$20 at the "finer" bars.  Kind of sad to have really good tequila but not the bar talent, although given the appearance of the place as a basic taco joint, I didn't expect much.
0	ardiY0k0iBofgU4LtA8hQ	Very surprised.  My first thoughts when making reservations at Craft were pretty much the same as when I made them for restaurants such as Bouchon, Fleur De Lys and Daniel Boulod--the meal is going to be horrible.  \r \r Definitely a shock.  First off, the dining room is lovely. The service is impeccable, and the food speaks for itself.  The three of us each ordered appetizzers, entrees and sides.  We started off with the sweetbreads with an onion soubise and pickled red onions--divine.  The lobster bisque, which was up to par with some of the best lobster bisques I've ever had. And the seared foie gras with fig compote--not too bad.  \r \r We shared four different meats, the filet, new york, kc, and bison.  Beside the sauces being a bit lacking, everything was delicious.  I will definitely return.
0	Sah1FI4XPhFRXUzWHCjLBg	A good pub is a wonderful place. Done right, it's a second home for those of us that like to bend an elbow.  Now, Vegas doesn't have a perfect pub.  The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).  But when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.  And there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.  The staff is very easy on the eyes and a vast improvement from the brown teeth and rolly-polly figure you'd find in jolly ol' England.
0	tdEPNG7klv5UgNtyfbtKsw	Like many others have said, this place is new and has some kinks to work out. I'll definitely try it out again in another couple months.  With that being said, my guy and I were really disappointed that for having a unique name and a "claim to fame" (at least potentially) they really don't own their "Oink Cafe" handle. Yeah they've got 5 different types of bacon but the menu is sadly lacking in entrees featuring what they're all about. In reality, this cafe is just like any other but with the option of five different types of bacon for those few items featuring bacon in the menu. And that's if the bacon hasn't run out.   Hopefully they find a way to make their mark.
0	A4AmKsM0SsWlD2WCYuXVIQ	My mom and I stopped here after reading the yelp reviews while prowling for a good spot to eat.  We were pleasantly surprised and happy to find that they were open Sunday evening, since it seemed to be a smaller restaurant. The customer service was fantastic.  My mom and I split an order of 5 rolled tacos and a carnitas plate, which was more than enough for 2 people.  Both dishes were fantastic, and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  We spent about $17 with drinks, but it was well worth it; we'll definitely be back!
0	dBtfpvM9P2wp9Lra6s3Q	I don't think I could ever give an airport restaurant more than 3 stars, so consider this rating middle-of-the road as far as airport restaurants go. The service is SUPER fast and friendly - I think I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger to arrive. On that note, it tasted like it took less than 5 minutes to make. My salad also tasted like the plastic bag it came from. But the ladies behind the counter were very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed. Can't comment on the drinks (I thought 11am on a Thursday may have been pushing it). But next time I am at the airport, I will probably try a different restaurant out before resorting to this place.
0	H7vkX19X6HeuLzw1GQuaA	Okay so I go in to get my enchilada on. I asked for ground beef and was loudly told "no ground beef, only shredded." So I decided to get 1 chicken and 1 cheese. The cheese was not melted in my enchilada and the chicken was a pinkish color. I was somewhat worried about food poisoning. :( I will not be returning.
0	hLsM9r0dzy7l2bIfR7Jm8g	I just can't seem to get on the Cafe Rio bandwagon. Oh, I've tried and tried and tried.  There are some things I like about Cafe Rio:  1) location. It is less than a 5 minute walk from my office.  2) the staff are super friendly and super quick, even when the place is hopping  3) it is one of the cleanest restaurants near UNLV.  4) tres leches. Oddly enough, the tres leches here is actually pretty decent. Its not the best, but I've had a heck of a lot worse at places that serve better food.  If this is all it took to get me to love something, my wife would be worried.   But the things I don't like are the reasons I just can't believe in the CR dogma: 1) The food is just bland. Granted, I am limited in my options since I don't eat meat, but the salsas and sauces just don't have much flavor. I am not expecting a spicy explosion of flavor, just something I can taste, but I can't get this here. 2) Price. Just under $10 gets me a burrito and a soda. I can get the same at Chipotle for a almost $4 less, and they have better salsa.  3) The feeling. After eating CR I feel like I was punched repeatedly in the stomach. Ok, its not that bad of feeling, but I just feel icky. I don't know why, but I don't get this same feeling from other burrito joints.
0	RY9WafOkeLBYqRwSDqgQ	If you want hip, fun, and live music while you're grubbing on some sushi, I recommend for everybody to come here.  I normally come here on Sundays because it's $1 Sake.  So for $10 I can get wasted and feel great!    Every time I walk in, the security already knows me and gives me a hug to greet me.  The setting is very laid back and casual.  There's no dress code and it's comfortable.  As I enter, on the right there's the DJ booth and there's always different DJ's spinning.  On Wednesday's they have an open spin night.  The decor is very modern with bamboos for plants.  There are some good art work on the wall to spice up the scenery inside.    As I walk a few steps more, there lies the bar and on most occasions that's where I'll end up but sometimes I'll take the table if I felt like it.  The stools are very comfortable and cushiony.  There are a lot of candles lit up through out the bar to give some lighting.  For the sports lovers, a huge flat screen TV hangs above the bar for some entertainment.  I've watched the Ms. USA on there one time.    The menu is mouthwatering and deliciouso.  I've eaten everything on there so I know it's all good.  I can't pin point which is my favorite because they're all just different.  Only sad part is they don't have any oysters in the menu.  :(  What's awesome about this spot is the different flavor sake.  i didn't realize there were so many different kinds.  I found my favorite to be Pineapple.  mmmm... yummy.
0	VWFq6hV96ychYd03ufkKA	My wife and I really enjoy dining at Beef O'Brady's in Iowa and were super excited to learn there was one in Surprise.  We went to the Surprise location the same day we discovered that it was open.  The location seems perfect for this type of restaurant.  Unfortunately our visit to the Beef O'Brady's in Surprise was a sad disappointment.  Both meals that were ordered included the beef.  It was not only clearly evident that frozen patties were used, but there was also the taste of freezer burn and staleness.  In other words the patty melt and hamburger we had pretty much sucked.  I can't really say anything to incredibly positive about the french fries and ranch dressing.  The chances of returning to the Beef O'Brady's in Surprise is pretty low, but we will still be looking forward to dining in the one in Iowa.  There can never be a substitution for genuine, fresh mid-western beef : - )
0	To7TL4161ZP0J5DWMRFMhg	Having quite enjoyed a couple of the chain's outlets in London I thought, a couple of weekends before Xmas, that I should try out the one in Edinburgh. Whilst not exactly a mistake this turned out not to be one of my better ideas. Service was slower than it should have been (maybe they were a staff member down) although they were as good as their word inasmuch as we were told a table would be available in 20 minutes & were seated fairly promptly when we returned from having a pint across the road. I can also imagine that seating walk-ins rather than taking bookings all night is a bit harder to do although it may well help generate a steady level of profit. Food-wise the \u00a39.95 anti-pasti is poor value for money, being simply three slices of bread, tomato & mozzarella, a dollop of bruschetta topping and a few slices of a couple of meats. The blob of truffle may be what puts the price up but there are plenty of places in the city doing far more varied takes on the dish at keener prices. The wine we chose was a decent drop but on the subject of drinks beware, if using tesco vouchers as I was  when they say no drinks they mean absolutely none. Whilst I can understand (but still disagree) that with alcohol I fail to see the point with tea & coffee. Won't be back in a hurry.
0	7n7PHgSiGcmN4uvu1MdIg	Beer selection is great. Bee Sting chicken wings were really good. The Popeye salad was okay and dinner went downhill from there. We ordered the cheeseburger pizza. It turned out to be a cheese and sweet pickle pizza.  Really weird and kind of gross. When we complained, the manager and server both noticed an entire slice of pizza with no hamburger at all. The manager told the server to comp our pizza but was told he already ran our credit card. The answer was "oh well, sorry" and both walked away with a dismissive gesture toward our table. We thought maybe they would offer a coupon or to credit the pizza from our tab but nothing more was even said and we left feeling ripped off and disappointed.
0	bgPfu4yB2p1OF72hAeJdA	Been to this place a couple of times.     Used to be a Hooters.  Still kinda looks like one.  Not a bad thing.   Quite a few flat screens,  some farily nice size.  First time went with my son.  He ordered the steak (medium) with some fries.  Steak came well,  very dry, and fries were out of a bag, and not very fresh.   I had the pork chop with corn and roasted fries.  Pork chop was cooked perfectly,  and my fries were better than the ones my son had.   Son was only able to eat a few bites for his meal before he gave up.  After a bit of a wait,  someone came by to ask how the food was,  and I told him that the steak was over cooked.  His response was that it tasted good though,  and walked away.    Granted for $10 that is a very good price for a steak,  and if it was cooked right,  I would give this place an extra star.  But coupled with the bad fries made me not want to ever come back to this place again.  Well last night my gf wanted to try it and watch the game.  I decided to take her to see what she thought.   Service was better this time (no long waits between check ups).  I ordered the pot roast, with garlic mashed potatoes, and baked beans.  My gf ordered the appetizer sampler platter.    My pot roast was quite tender and tasty.  It could have used some slices of onion, carrot and celery to make it a little better.  Garlic mashed potatoes were also quite good,  but my baked beans were way too sweet.    My gf's appetizer platter had fried mozzerella sticks,  wings and nachos.  Everything on it was actually pretty good a well.    So after a bad first visit, and a good 2nd,  I'm willing to give this place another chance.    Sill have a problem with the fries and the steak from the 1st vist though.  Otherwise would've been 3 stars.  But the price is quite good otherwise.
0	bJ6gCcNVez0dtMfxrOZSfA	Every time I come to Vegas, I make it a point to grab lunch here! There pizza is top notch, the brews are cold and delicious and the service is usually awesome! The last couple of times I've gone, the bartender/server was a younger guy that was happy to help, knowledgeable and even cut my cigar for me when I left! I totally recommend grabbing a pie and brew here, and try the wings as well! Worth the trip, every time!
0	f3DvBjvrcm9EFyiFHMHvg	My husband and I went there for lunch and it was plain jane. The girl that seated us had a bit of an attitude but both the server that brought us our drinks and the man that took our order were the exact opposite. They were helpful and friendly.  The speed of the service was great and the food came quickly. The reason for the low rating? It has to be because of the prices vs the food. I think $12 for what is essentially a deli sandwhich ( I had the smoked turkey and hubby had the egg salad) is way too much. On the plus side the fries were really yummy.  Maybe we will try once again but this time for dinner to see if they have a better quality.
0	zl5SbMWzPr6kaN31p8sXfg	Went there because of the reviews. First, server was fantastic but did miss one this. Got the corn bread and it was flat and crispy. Later saw others with  fluffy corn bread and maybe it was better,  Nothing  special taste wise either.  Got the $9 polled pork sandwich. Taste was wonderful but it was a small bar food portion.  So to me this was an average place to go.  Nothing wrong with going there but just think more of a bar than a restaurant.
0	6NqbQ2b6LCoo2uRtJHHw	Tried it for the first time this week. My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll. Can't figure out what all the rage over this chain is about. It's fast service which is great when you need food fast. But it's a little over priced sandwhich and fountain drink both. My lunch was $8.  The place is clean but not really inviting as 90% of the customers take it to go or eat at an outdoor table.
0	IfiPkc8f9mBi2lMcWUsQQ	I am reviewing this order based on take-out, so I cannot comment on the in-house service or atmosphere.  Considering how many Thai and Asian places there are in the area, I would skip this place.  Overall, the prices seemed too high for the portions they gave and the food was only ok.  I ordered two salads the Thailandaise and the Cambodgienne salad. The thailandaise salad was very good and tasty, probably the best thing I ate all night. The Cambodgienne salad was very bland. The dressing was almost tasteless so it was essentially a bed of iceburg lettuce with some slices of chicken on top. Extremely disappointing and not worth the money I paid for it at all.  The dishes I ordered were beef and broccoli, chicken in peanut sauce, and crevettes aux trois saveurs. The beef and broccoli and the shrimp dish were okay, but nothing special. The chicken in peanut sauce tasted pretty good but the crispy spinach that came with it was not crispy at all and there was only about 1 forkful. (I live about 2 minutes away from the restaurant, so travel time wouldn't have made it soggy. I did show up 5 minutes earlier than they told me to and the meal was already done and sitting on the counter, so the crispy spinach probably sat for some time.)  Extra disappointing since I pretty much begged for an extra bowl of crispy spinach but they (the 3 different people I spoke to on the phone in French and English) didn't understand me. Oh well, it would have probably been soggy anyways.  Like I said at the beginning, considering the options in the area, and the price to portion ratio, I would go elsewhere.
0	hxjvaHSTilv6qCdDxuuQ	They ship their bread in from Philly. It's real deal Amoroso rolls. Oh yeah, It's 24 hrs too. That's always a bonus.   It's not a restaurant, so expect to take-out, or eat at a small picnic table (outdoors), There's no indoor seating. Minus one star for that.  It's an authentic cheese steak. You won't be dissapointed!!!
0	GEywqxH5IEvDgFVHKyX12A	Friendly service, but the food was terrible. The onion rings and smoothies were pretty good but everything else was pretty bad. My burger was over cooked and over seasoned. My husbands French fries had no salt or flavor. The Hawaiian bliss smoothie was great. We might give this place another shot before we write it off.
0	zlda4guMukgQ4HGzUvVw	Used to be a regular at this place.  I never had a problem with service and the manager there is very good and attentive.  Over the past 6 months I began to notice a huge change.  First the food portions are way smaller.  The wings, which they are supposed to be known for look like they came of chickens that had anorexia, there was almost no meat on the bone.  The last time we went my wife ordered them grilled.  They came out charred and not one person, chef, expediter or server noticed this?  Pathetic.  She was so done with this place she didn't even bother to send them back.  We also noticed the side salads were noticeably smaller.  I mean cutting costs on the amount of lettuce you use?    I am not a big fan nor was when we used to go there often of their pizza, I think the crust is to soggy for my liking.  Sandwiches are decent, but the amount of fries you now get is far less, more cost cutting measures it seems.  The final straw was a month or so ago I was informed that to sit in the bar area you now must put your name on a list.  Who has a seating list for the bar area?  I never heard of such a thing.    In the hyper competitive world of sports bars, in the SE Valley area I can find a few more that have better quality food, with larger portions for about the same price.  They now get my hard earned dollars.  The only reason its not a 1 is that I do like many of the servers there and unlike many reviews have never had an issue with this part of the place.
0	9cGEmDuU1IOENeygTffEw	Decent food, but abysmal service.  Pizza is a slight upgrade over Antoon's/Sorrento's. If you want gourmet pizza this isn't the place, but it suffices when you're intoxicated by your drug of choice.  Sandwiches are great, they have some pretty unique and satisfying offerings on the menu. Calzones and the like are average for the price. Fries are well-seasoned and fresh cut, and I think they'd be great if I ever ate in. I've only eaten them through delivery, so they've always showed up soggy and cold.   Service, however, is just awful. Every time I've called the place to check on the status of my order I've been given a lot of attitude. The drivers are no better, they often complain about how little of a tip you've given them (I think 15% is plenty for bad service) or how long they've had to wait outside (not my problem you didn't call when you were here and didn't ring the bell). I've had food delivered after 70 minutes when the estimated delivery time was 30. Orders are often entirely forgotten.  Skip everything but the sandwiches here. There is better food to be had in Oakland with substantially better service. If you want a sandwich, pick it up. Learn from my experience: do not get delivery unless you want a headache.
0	M2WRmJDtFKVji8os5lxoA	My family was there during what should be prime time for dinner (6:30pm) and we were the only people in the place. By the look of the dust on the other tables around us, that must be a daily occurrence.  Still we were not deterred. Maybe we were about to be let in on a secret that nobody knows yet.  We were excited to try it out.  We started out with the Buffalo Chicken dip.  The dip appeared/tasted to be a mixture of very little chicken, some hot sauce and a lot of mayo. Slightly bizarre tasting, but can't go wrong by smothering anything in hot sauce.  It was served with homemade, freshly fried chips and that was a plus.  I got the bacon burger, my wife got the fried chicken and my kids got a chicken finger and a burger.  Now while none of the food was bad, it wasn't great either. There was nothing about any of our food that made us want to go again.  The burger was decent, but was served as two small patties in a larger bun. I appreciate the chef taking some creative license, but it was awkward and messy to eat. The fried chicken and chicken fingers seemed to have no seasoning at all.  The only thing I tasted was the batter.    Listen, I want any small business to succeed.  The waitress was really cute and very sweet. The menu was small and simple.  Good idea for a new restaurant.  However, they really need someone to come in and revamp the menu if they want to start keeping first time customers.
0	voUCA7AReDha6xQHppA	I'd eagerly awaited eating here as I've heard good reviews from others.  The plates heated to 500 degrees is a gimmick that didn't impress me at all.  I think the bottom line is I like my steaks grilled, not broiled.  The sides (creamed spinach and mashed potatoes) were no better than what I make at home.    As for the atmosphere, it's a huge room and we had a nice view of the Strip.  The lighting was a bit too dim.  Nice staff.  We ordered wine and they brought us a 2006, not the 2010 we'd ordered.  Looked at the wine list again and ordered another bottle which they didn't have.  This restaurant had only been opened 3 or 4 weeks, and the wine list didn't reflect what they had in their cellar.  I wouldn't go to any Ruth's Chris again, it's not bad, it's just not the style of cooking that I prefer.
0	6ZZ4z0hVhKyQCanrYQbJw	I am a McDonalds lover no matter what. Everytime we travel to Phoenix we stop here and get some food. is busy mostly all the time which makes it better because u know ur always getting fresh food the only reason i dont give the fivr stars is because the customer service is not too great. They have so many customers daily that they forget to be polite with everybody. Restrooms are clean but can be cleaner.
0	yPVwoUUvu922WQASh3dBrg	It started out with last night being so beautiful that Eric R. and I decided to go for a walk.  He asked what places to eat were over in the Smith's shopping center, and we meandered across the freeway.  We noticed China Tango was new, but I saw Jennifer C.'s review and knew at least a big plate of rice included with a dish would make Eric happy.  It looks like we should order at the counter, but the cashier handed us a menu and told us to sit at a booth since we were dine-in.  He gave us a styrofoam bowl of fried wonton strips and a plastic sauce cup of sweet n sour.  We got small styrofoam cups of water, styrofoam plates, and mini plastic forks.  We decided on egg drop soup (I was skeptical because soup was pricey like $5.25) and ginger and onion beef.  The soup came out immediately in a big plastic tub with a plastic spoon (not a ladle).  It had corn in it and was hot, just hard to serve in these small styrofoam bowls we had and little plastic spoons to eat it with.    The ginger and onion beef had lots of green onions (good), bamboo shoots, red onions, and ginger.  Without a doubt, we received a huge plate of white rice.  The beef though - it looked good, but the texture was horrible.  You could call it "cheap meat" but I could not chew it.  I tried a few times and ended up spitting it out each time.  I ate the green onions with my rice instead.  At least the sauce was okay.  For the inedible dish and expensive soup, it was over $18.  Imagine if each person got a dish, yikes!  There is no value for your money.  Just lots and lots of styrofoam...! Will not return!
0	mTSRzy6sf6oXCkKx4XDPw	This place is so accommodating that they allowed our meet-up group to watch the Victoria's Secret fashion show on the big screen last night! Talk about service. The service was also spot on. I ate before I arrived, so didn't eat there...but my friends did and the food looked fresh and delicious! They have 2 pool tables (lack of brush to clean off all the debris on the pool table prevented me from giving them 5 stars), tons of TV and lots of room.   We had the only table with females, which was typical for this type of bar i guess. The servers were dressed in stuff that may have been seen on the VS fashion show!   The prices are very reasonable too! Will definitely be back for the food ^_~
0	HHu6JdGpNLCL99cawFlVg	I don't even know where to start this. WOW, was this an experience in more ways than one. At 1:30 on a Sunday, this place was pretty packed. And boy was the service s l o w. Honestly it took me close to 25 minutes to order in the dining room. If I hadn't walked here, and been craving a frosty and baked potato from just having my wisdom teeth out, I would have definitely gone somewhere else.   They had 1 single person working the register. She was nice, but extremely slow. It was almost comical how long this took. Luckily the food was ready in probably 3 minutes after I ordered. Why they didn't have some one else come up to help, I'll never know.   The clientele that this place was filled with was less than desirable. To make it worse, there was even two workers 'on break' on the patio next to us, talking about their "baby mamma's & Baby daddy" drama ... I kid you not. It was like we were in a live-action version of Jerry Springer.   Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this location.
0	YQbbgx7BiADAmy1gjVDFg	Sun Penang is great. I was pretty skeptically initially considering that Asian food in Squirrel Hill tends towards hit or miss. I guess Yelp doesn't consider Malaysian food to be a category?  The service is quite good and attentive. The room is very airy and spacious. Though the restaurant was quite busy, it never felt crowded or too noisy.  Though I think some of the menu items that tend toward Thai are only okay, I think the real gems are their seafood/fish dishes. Basically  for those who are willing to be more adventurous, just order the things that you've never heard of before and you won't be disappointed. Portions are quite generous. It's a great place for groups and couples.
0	zhXc8pBfhq9UaqxuS4xQ	We ordered our pizza online from their website, and our food was ready in no time!   Food: We ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and green peppers, and garlic sticks. The pizza was really good, but the garlic sticks were not very good in my opinion, and didn't taste like much.   Service: The guy serving me was very friendly and efficient.  However, we ordered two marinara sauce cups for the garlic sticks, and only ended up receiving one. No big deal, but still.   Overall experience at this Domino's location was great, and would order from them again!
0	yS73tram3VeExwr6o3iMrA	A great spot for lunch if you're in the area! Located in the shopping center on the corner of Eastern and Sunridge Heights near other wonderful establishments. Their lunch specials are an amazing deal! For $6.95 you receive a bowl of their Soup of the Day, a small salad with choice of dressing, Crispy Roll, and choice of entree. So, lots of food for $7? Yeah. If you're really hungry, they have another lunch special for $9.95 that includes a couple additional items.  We had their Cucumber Soup and It tasty and refreshing! The salad was fresh and I loved the peanut dressing (basically their peanut sauce that would typically accompany satay, which I am addicted to) on it! The Crispy Roll was a fresh and very crispy spring/vegetable roll. For my entree, I chose the Tofu Pad Thai (with level 3 spicy, out of 5). The tofu was fried, not my favorite preparation, but at least it was nicely cooked. The noodles were well-flavored, but overcooked and not my favorite version of the dish. Level 3 was a bit spicy for me, so it was difficult to eat - I'm definitely going with level 2 next time.  Overall, it's not my favorite Thai food in town. It wasn't horrendous and for all the other reasons (insanely cheap!), it might be enticing to return. Service was wonderful and if you pay with cash, they offer 10% off your bill!
0	F2fLPL9rAKCkYDwqb2nobg	Now. this was my 1st time buying a cookie from this place @ the miracle mile shops. I was on the fence about it b/c the whole reason I was @ the strip that day was to walk around and have fun window shopping w/ my bf and get some great steps in that day on my bodybugg. But... he was looking @ this place like a lost lil puppy. and..well er.. it smelled divine! We went over and decided to share a cookie, better than eating the whole one by myself!  we split the chocolate chip and walnut. so flipping good! WORTH EA. AND EVERY CALORIE! AND would have been even better if it was warmer. I guess I coudl have asked her if it was possible to warm it for a few seconds. maybe nxt time. if they do this for me, they will get 5 stars and a visit from ea. of the friends I have that come into town! :) if not, i will update to let you know.  NOTE: yes there is no seating here. it is simply a cookie shop.  I think they sold water too. Didnt even care if they have a place to sit. I was happy with the cookie. The mall has plenty of  seating in the middle all along its "miracle mile".
0	f0GxEvqGxyED5HtHTuso3Q	I wanted to like this place but as a delivery option, it fell short of expectations.  First, it took 1.25 hours for delivery (on a non-snowy Edinburgh evening), second, the doner kabab w/ chips that I ordered was missing the chips + the garlic sauce that it was to have come with.  Lettuce was a bit on the dried/old side and only 2 slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad.  Third, there was a curry sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top.  I think I'd come back to give it another try, since the price is fair -- however, I'd avoid delivery and do take-away instead.
0	ciDjOQePVe9XgZ8hOdGdg	Arrived at 2pm.  Waited around for them to open at 4pm.  Sat by the window overlooking the pool, very nice view with natural light.  Started with the Cobb Salad.  My wife and I split it and they were nice enough to put it into two bowls for us.  It was an excellent salad, tasty and well prepared, no big peices of lettuce or funky old bits of anything.  For the main course I had the Imperial burger and my wife had the Pilsner burger. We shared the cheddar and bacon fries.  My wifes burger was medium rare, she ordered it medium well.  I ordered mine medium and it came out well done like meat loaf which really hurt the flavor of it.  My wife's burger was pretty tasty.  Mine was just ruined by being over cooked and the advertised short rib on top of the patty was so minuscule that I barely noticed it.  The fried were just bad.  The first fry I tried was cold, the second one was really hot, kind of wierd.  The bacon was fine but the cheddar was not melted shredded cheddar instead it was a pasty gravy that was more wondra than cheese and was broken and grainy, really nasty.  The beer and liquor selection is good and the prices are fair.  I had a couple of beers.  It seems like all the beers are bottled but that's OK.  The service was very good.  I can see how this place could really be great if everything came together for one diner, but if a place can't be consistent I'm not willing to give them my business.     Another thing of note: No minors allowed.
0	i3CI6SpBmvJBB8SuFxlYxw	Really wanted to like this place, but after three visits we are not fans.  - Location is clean and the employees are nice but not necessarily helpful. - Burgers are a higher quality for fast food but on the expensive side. - Fries are super greasy. - Cheese curds are nasty. - Custard is not much better than a dairy queen soft serve quality.  Every time we ate here, we felt like crap afterwards. So many better, cheaper fast food options.
0	vFkt68tSgSeloFk2RsMmA	This place should be 4 1/2 stars.  Service very fast but sincere and patient.  The protein pancakes are as good of a pancake as there is.  It's a cakier pancake with blueberries and granola on wheat flour.  You can order the pancakes only, or you can upgrade your eggs and pancake special to include the protein pancake.   The eggs are perfectly cooked.  It's convenient to get to and it put a big smile on my face as even during lunch hours, it, thank god, serves breakfast.  The interior is a tan colored minimalist look but with an American theme that has this interesting blown up map of the United States.  Bathrooms are clean also.  The only thing that prevents this place from being five stars is that  the coffee isn't eye opening.  If they serve Starbucks Coffee or something stronger or comparable, there will be no better breakfast place than it.  But in this part of the US, the good American Breakfast joint is ubiquitous.
0	9DTcAHsoHP6LmOkQCVtPZw	This place is connected to a Chevron gas station and is open 24/7. The inside is sometime messy but, the staff that works the drive thru is usually always nice and gets your order correct the first time. I also like the fact that the drinks come in plastic cups and not the Styrofoam ones that some are using. The plastic one make the ice last longer and so the drink stays colder. This is an American staple and will always be back.
0	ZyJB7oQJzjfJ01JIh5uhQ	Sooo.. Me and my friends all went on grand opening night. Granted it was kind of crowded but the service was awful!!!! I work in customer service and I guess I just thought during their grand opening they would have gone out of their way to have the best customer service ever so that people would come back but that definitely was NOT the case! I was ignored at the bar multiple times at multiple bars, it was awful. And to add insult to injury when a bartender would even acknowledge that we were sitting there they were so rude and acted like we were bothering them when u would think they would appreciate us spending money in there place I guess not
0	BG8HNvgF2MPl0JgdMROvBQ	I was in Urbana, IL for a few days on business. I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.  The place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.  With that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.  I think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.' What the hell kinda combination is that? I'd go back if I was in town. :)
0	Paz0RP9YPDfQrwlfoVDN1w	If you want quality, quantity, and reasonable prices--don't go here.  The food could hardly be deemed within an authentic deli realm.  The service is poor, the offerings minute, and taste lacking (chicken soup too salty, sandwiches bland, and desserts hardly unique or fresh).  Even though they are open 24 hours, you have 24 hours to find another venue.  This is a side-show at Circus Circus that is not worth attending.
0	RIXtyFsF1JfWmE5QSxRr2A	Ok in a pinch. 1st time I called for take out, they didn't answer. Weeks later, I tried again. Nothing exotic - basic sausage & onion.  Bland, skimpy distribution of meat & veggie.  While neighbors rave, I prefer Buon Gusto, just down the road. Doubtful return.
0	NSTt85dBnTtaUfUxxeudwg	We're not big beer drinkers so I can't attest to the beer selection. If you are looking for beer reviews . . . this isn't the one for you.  The restaurant came as quite a surprise to me . . . upscale North Scottsdale and the name "Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers" didn't seem to fit the area. Nevertheless, Hubby and I had read about the Make Your Own Mac & Cheese and were instantly intrigued.  I personally have been a fan of all mac & cheese, even the Kraft box cheese, since I was a kid, but now with all the gourmet versions available, I've become quite a mac & cheese snob. CB2's mac & cheese didn't cut it for me or my hubby. It is a nice sized portion to share, even as just a side.  It was creamy, but bland . . . made with what appeared to be wide egg noodles instead of actual pasta noodles. The base cheese is very mild pepperjack and provolone, so we added some swiss and gruyere.  Still not flavorful enough. So we packed it up and brought it home, doctored it up and ate it the next day for lunch.  My husband had the Bacon Blue Burger.  It was good, but he has had much better, even at BluBurger Grill. Because the burger is so tall, they bring it with a steak knife . . . you really do have to cut it to eat it. I had a grilled cheese sandwich . . . it was pretty decent, although if they messed something like this up, they would have received one star.  Both our main courses came with a side . . . we chose the sweet tots. They were good, but not as delicious as the sweet tots from Tryst Cafe. If you love those, these will surely disappoint.   The gentleman who took our order and ran our food was delightful and helpful, as were the other food runners in the restaurant. The restaurant is clean, fast and provides plenty of entertainment with a dozen plasma screens running mostly sports. The clientele ran the gamut, from older couples to families with kids.
0	9O5hwsBLOs3WitccWJwZKw	i am so happy with Siu Wok. the food was yummy, got Pepper Steak, pork fried rice and tangerine beef.  the Pepper steak was seasoned right, mild spicyness and the sauce was exactly what i was looking for. vegies were still crisp and the meat was tender.  the tangerine beef was awesome. orangy but not overly orange. sweet in the best way, long red chili peppers soaking in the sauce. yum. the meat was fried crispy but  was still tender. just the way i like my tangerine beef.  the fried rice was great. nothing too fancy. just perfect.   the egg rolls were tasty and seemed fresh.  for the above it was around 23 bucks. very affordable.  the best part about the whole thing. they deliver. OMG!! chinese food delivered. Phoenix is a real city now. the delivery range is from 40th street to 40 ave, bethany home to broadway.   all in all a very good experiance and i will be ordering more from them. probably often.
0	3W8J6O5dS8khVDOYuW2cIA	I don't see what the hype is about this place.  My lovely British boyfriend wanted to go to Nando's for a quick lunch before we did some sightseeing and told me I would love it.  I mean, I like chicken and all, but I was extremely underwhelmed by my experience there.  It's just a chicken wrap with a choice of a few sauces.  The hottest hot sauce is WEAAAAAKKKK.  Seriously, I want to cry while I'm eating my spicy chicken wraps.  Also, I got the mashed peas as a side and it was the strangest thing on the planet - I do not recommend trying them.  I mean, I would eat here again, but wouldn't rate it high on my list of places to go to!  As a footnote, I also do not see the hype about Chick-Fil-A and Church's Chicken in America (down in the South) and everyone raves about both spots.
0	zj8xvn1ECJzLA3Fi6kTsaQ	The Shrimp Ajo and Chicken Mojito looked surprisingly similar - the beds of rice, beans and toppings of mango salsa were identical. The only thing that changed was the protein.   The shrimp was well spiced and garlicky, although had no noticeable sauce as advertised in the menu. The marinated chicken was tender and tasty. Biggest complaint about the food was the plastic flatware. Hard to believe this is a regulation because this is an airport property, we eat in airports regularly with metal silverware.  Our biggest disappointment were the drinks. My Patron Margarita was extremely rough for Patron. (I find it very hard to believe it WAS Patron.) Our server's comment when I complained? "Well, it's Silver." (OK...) $15 for the margarita, $14 for the O-tini (their own conconction) and I walked away without the slightest of buzzes. I smell a watered down rat...
0	m66CaobCgfJhZrvqWXqA	Bradley Ogden is in my humble opinion, the most consistent upscale restaurant in Las Vegas.  The service is excellent, and the food absolutely delicious.  My husband and I go to Vegas once a year, and we make certain there is a night dedicated to Bradley Ogden.  The restaurant focuses on farm-fresh produce and excellent meats.  Although the menu can seem a bit simplistic, it is always thoroughly enjoyable and on the whimsical side.  This trip, we enjoyed a lovely prix fixe for a very affordable $60 per person.  The twice backed Maytag blue cheese souffle was perfect, as was the pork and halibut.  For dessert was a delightful white chocolate panna cotta and pb&j bread pudding.    I tend to be sensitive to sodium, and I found for the first time, that my main course was a bit heavy handed on the salt, but given the excellent track record I'm definitely making reservations next year.  The staff is extremely accommodating for events such as birthdays and anniversaries.  I really can't recommend Bradley Ogden enough.  Enjoy!
0	S4bqMAtUchtONwYp3I9pDw	5 stars for service...our waiter on a slow Tuesday afternoon, right after the lunch rush, was a funny guy and pretty good at his job. As well, my friend and I never wanted for refills on our Dr. Pepper, which is the one true way to my heart at any restaurant.  3 stars for the food, which frankly, wasn't all that great but that may have been due to what I ordered more than anything else (Blue Moon burger). To be honest, I've had better cheeseburgers from Denny's (see my review, LOL) but I guess that isn't the draw here...my friend's beef brisket sandwich looked and smelled delicious and there's plenty more  items on the menu to choose from next time.  Of course, I must reiterate that since there isn't much in the way of decent dining in the neighborhood my friend and I work in (she about 5 blocks west, myself about 3), this place will definitely get a second chance not too long from now.
0	ecrF289veW9f42JSU77vQ	I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to my 'hood.  C'est la vie.  As the other reviewer said, the service is slower than Methuselah and not really worth the wait because it's just not that good.  We ordered some cheese quesadillas...you'd think it'd be impossible to mess these up.  Nope...it's possible.  There was actually too much cheese on it...about an inch of cheese...I'm not kidding...it was really crazy.  The lemonade is decent, but if you're in the area, why not go to the Middle Eastern bakery next door and get really good fresh squeezed stuff with a hint of orange-flower water--it's excellent.  We went back twice more thinking that maybe this place would get better.  It didn't.  :(
0	vyCHvcycs2Xwe183cwS1A	Big bummer, small pieces at Pisces.   My husband and I stopped by on a weekend afternoon to try their sushi. They were not offering the $9 all-you-can-eat; however, they offered a "half-off" special: order a roll and get a roll equal or lesser value for free. Cool. We ordered several rolls...I think they had a thin slice contest. The toppings were the thinnest slices I have ever seen. The rolls were small, loosely rolled, and overall it seemed to lack true quality. I was hoping for better since the location is fantastic, but they didn't satisfy.  The interior has a great concept with private "pods" for your party and the theme felt just right for the location. But worn decor already? It's only been open under a year and the interior needs some help. The wallpaper is puckering in places. In addition, they lack on visible cleanliness...greasy head marks on the windows and the soy sauce containers were dirty. Overlooking some of the minor issues, the rock wall/art is it's highlight.  Sorry, Pisces, you didn't win me over.
0	9Miji2svxX7lODbJTNIw	I can say that the sushi is actually pleasant.  The atmosphere is quaint -- not over the top but cute.  My wife and I ordered 5 sushi rolls (california, spicy tuna, spicy crab and salmon tempura.)  I didn't care for spicy crab because they mix the crab meat with mayo -- but my wife likes it that way.  Cali and tuna rolls were good.  My fav was the salmon tempura rolls -- that was awesome.  They fry the salmon in tempura batter and then roll it.  Really good!  For an appetizer, we got soft shell crab.  It was a pretty large size crab and is enough for two people as an appetizer.  However, the batter used wasn't your typical tempura -- it was a thicker kind of batter, like the kind used on fried shrimp.  Tempura is much lighter and fluffier, while this batter was hard and extra crispy.  I didn't care for the batter at all -- but the crab itself was very meaty.  Not sure where they get their soft shell crabs, but they were pretty meaty.  For our entree, we got the Teriyaki Beef bowl with rice and vegetables.  That was good.  I asked for the Teriyaki sauce on the side because you just never know what a restaurant will do with that sauce.  They may end up using too much to where it becomes over powering.  So having it on the side was a smart choice.  It was very good -- vegetables were crispy and rice was well cooked and fluffy.  The service was very good.  Very kind girls working there.  We were there on a thursday night (st paddy's day 2011) and it wasn't that busy.  The sushi was brought out within 3-4 minutes... way before the appetizer.  However, in all fairness, I should have known better.  No matter where you go, if you do not request the appetizers brought out before the sushi, then your sushi will often arrive beforehand.  This is because sushi is made very quickly, whereas appetizers take some time -- especially soft shell crab because it needs to be fried.  I had a good laugh when the sushi came out first -- and our waitress said she could take it back and wait until the appetizers were done, but my wife said no.  It was funny though -- no big deal.  Prices are NORMAL -- and in some cases, GOOD compared to other places.  Their 50% off menu contains most of the normal sushi rolls most people likely order (california, spicy tuna, etc.)    If you just like sushi rolls -- then seriously, do not order anything else.  Most of the rolls come in 8 pieces, averaging $4 per roll.  Most women can probably tuck away 2-3 rolls, while men can put away 4-5 rolls.    So, for women, you'll spend between $8-$12 while men will spend between $16 - $20.  You can also call ahead and pick it up.  These prices are, as I said, normal -- but can also be considered cheap as compared to some of the more higher end sushi places.  Total we spent: $45.00  -- which isn't bad at all considering there were two of us, we got sushi rolls, an entree PLUS appetizer and we got full.  The food is good -- give it a try.  It makes a great place to eat at before heading over to Aliante Casino to see a movie.  Not to mention, their prices are about the same as getting popcorn, candy and soda at the movies -- how scary is that?!!  So skip the popcorn and get sushi instead.  It's better for you anyway -- and Lord knows our country needs to lose weight.  :-)  Final note:  The reviewer before me commented on the take out order being more important to the restaurant than the customers.  Nearly 95% of the restaurants out there do the same thing.  I worked in the restaurant industry for a long time at many different places, and we always catered to take out orders first that had large tickets.  That's just the way it is.  Get used to it.  A $600 order is always going to take precedence.  It may be wrong to do, but that's often what happens.  I feel bad for those people because they're right, it's not fair -- but at the same time, it could have happened to them at any restaurant... because this kind of thing does happen at MANY restaurants all the time.
0	3hSRJ5uHyuMM1p8ohCrBQ	This is not a bad place to have dinner. The atmosphere is casual and the service is just wonderful. I had the carpaccio and squash ravioli and they were amazing. Price is a little higher than Friday's but trust me, you would want to come here instead.
0	FpaTY6UqjGXEFQbF2Zn7UA	Nachdem ich vor einiger Zeit im "Borsalino" mit ein paar Freunden eher gemischte Erfahrungen machen musste, bin ich mit meiner Freundin zum Valentinstag nochmals eingekehrt.  Wir hatten reserviert und nach dem Betreten des Restaurants warteten wir auf jemanden, der uns den Tisch zeigt. Wir wurden zwar von 3 Bedienungen bemerkt, aber musste dennoch etwas 2 Minuten dort herumstehen. War schonmal kein guter Einstand.  Auch das Essen war diesmal wieder nicht \u00fcberzeugend, was mich zu noch einer schlechteren Kritik bewogen hat. Die Getr\u00e4nke und das Essen kamen in einer guten Zeit am Tisch an. Jedoch war meine Pizza bereits eher lauwarm als heiss und geschmacklich sehr lasch. Wenigstens das Essen meiner Begleitung war besser.  Die Bedienung war sichtlich gestresst und ausgelastet, was sich nat\u00fcrlich auf die Freundlichkeit und die Aufmerksmakeit auswirkte. Auf unsere Rechnung mussten wir locker 10 Minuten warten, nachdem wir unsere Zahlungswilligkeit eindeutig signalisiert hatten.  Leider war das nun mein letzter Besuch im Restaurant. :-/
0	5J8PVrvnyXs5qszYVLXicA	I went here for my Sisters birthday a few months ago.  I had been to the other location in LA, so I was familiar with the food.  The lobby and restaurant are decorated really neat- and has a very young and hip feel.  I wasn't thrilled with our seating arrangement- we were sat at a very large round table and felt too far away from the other guests (there were about 8 of us).  The food was great, drinks were yummy- I had a blue curacao martini that was so good!!  Service was good, and the manager even stopped by to wish us well.  Nice touch!  I highly recommend this place if you want to celebrate a birthday or other occasion and looking for a fun and funky atmosphere.
0	skomuGcxsfYDrOMftn0Ztw	Came here on a trip to Vegas with a group of friends. We had just arrived in Vegas and were hungry. The boys suggested Cafe Moda since they went there the last time and raved about the sisig. So we took cabs to Cafe Moda, which is off the strip. When we got there, there were groups of people outside the door. Inside, we waited to be seated. There was a nice fire at the front and considering how cold it was outside, it was nice to stand in front of it. We were seated withing 2 minutes. It was super dark inside and I couldn't really see other people but there were lots. People were dancing on the dance floor and the DJ was pretty good!  We ordered drinks for each of us (have to if you're in Vegas) and the 2 plates of chicken wings, 2 plates of sisig, and 1 plate of fried rice. My drink was really strong (jack and coke) so it's good to know they didn't skimp on the alcohol. Our food came but they only gave us 1 sisig. We didn't mind though because we got full off the rest of food. Every dish we had was excellent and we polished everything off quickly. We definitely left very satisfied. Didn't stay for any dancing though because we were tired.  The next night, we ended up at Cafe Moda again because we were all hungry at 2am after going to a club. Ordered wonton soup, chicken wings, more sisig, and regular steamed rice. The wonton soup was really flavorful and I thought it was one of the best wonton soups I've ever had. Hmm Filipino wonton soup better than any Chinese wonton soup I've ever had?... yes even though I'm Chinese, I had to admit it. It was damn good! The sisig had too much onion this time because every bite I took had an onion taste... didn't enjoy it as much.  Overall, can't wait to come back to Cafe Moda for the food. It's a small little club too but I wouldn't come here just to dance.
0	169MH6On4x403XdW3902ZA	Again I am listening to my fellow Yelpers and trusting their opinions on food.  Maybe my taste buds are not so developed.   You can tell where I am going with this right?  The food here was just okay.  It didn't "wow" me.  I'm looking for a place to "wow" my taste buds.  I had what everyone recommended- the omelet with chicken fried rice and my hubby had the Japanese Hamburg.  The omelet wasn't that special and the fried rice was not tasty enough.  If I can make tastier fried rice at home, why am I paying $13 for this dish?  It had no flavor.  A bit more seasonings please... the cost of food has gone up but soy sauce is still pretty cheap.    As for the Hamburg, the first bite is very good but the sauce became too sour after a first few bites.  I'm not into sour hamburger patties.    I am giving this place 2 stars because the place is well decorated and very comfortable inside and the ketchup on my omelet was that best thing I ate that night.  That ketchup was special but too bad the rest of the food lacked it.
0	jUAMqclqLGPa5Lv0EUPRJw	Food is 5 stars, but the automatic wait for a table is not for the weak. The staff will have your back to cover thr HUGE menu.  Start your meal with some toasted ravioli and golden BBQ wings. Order your deep dish at the same time and it will be ready by time you are done with the apps. Make sure to order a Bellini and a pizza cookie too!
0	JMV24i9j0Q65MaFPz9pw	I've gotten food from here twice. Experienced good customer service however the food taste bland. Not sure if the food is made "fresh" or to order. I ordered a side of Spanish rice and the lady put a ziploc bag of rice in the microwave (that I had to wait 5 minutes for). I would rather drive down the street to Roberto's for Mexican food.
0	dLA7BmKAwNcrMkTv2rpEkQ	One of the better values in vegas, this hip bastardized mexican place is pretty freakin good.  I got the baby back ribs marinated in some watermellon reduction.  Flan for desert was great.  1+ extra point for ironic  sexual innuendo in the name.
0	JdCc6gdjBAYgR2mwLZyLeA	Went on date night the 3rd night they were open. Food was ok. Service was good. Spinach and goat cheese salad had no dressing. It was the orange wedge? Ok a little different but ok. Server told us after we ate half. The owner was pacing back and fourth but not once came by our table to greet us.  Little things like that make a big difference to me. Not sure if we will be back
0	xsQBjmbsRtyPkCqwaDeKLw	Wow, I'm surprised at the wide range of experiences people have had at this place.  I went with friends last year, and until this year I thought it was the best steak I'd ever had.  It was cooked to perfection and had a really nice pepper rub that must have left a crust an inch thick.  If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)  The restaurant was definitely crowded and loud, though.  Can't win 'em all, but I sure can deduct a star here and there...!
0	K55K46cdpk65vVQLd066EA	Bring on the mini-veggie omelet with fresh fruit substitute, dry rye toast and Kona coffee (no cream).  The mini-veggie is still my favorite for its "lightness" and "taste".  Most breakfast places seem to serve large 3 and 4 egg omelets with gooey ingredients but I have become accustomed to the smaller, dryer white egg Le Peep omelet.  Today there were no tomatoes but I didn't miss them.  However, I did splurge on the Knott's preserves and felt I had to try one of each with the dry rye.  Le Peep servers (Matt & Greg have moved on) but Rushella knows what I want when I bring in the daily paper.  I usually sit outside even in the winter with my back to the sun except today when it was too hot and sat inside. The green patio chairs could be more comfortable but that is minor in comparison to getting the mini-veggie.  An ocean view would be nice to look at but that is also minor (well, not really) in comparison to getting the mini-veggie.  A cool forest setting would be nice to look at but that is also minor (again, not really) in comparison to getting the mini-veggie.... The impending heat above 110 for the eighth straight day must be getting to me... Why am I not in Manhattan Beach or in Flagstaff today...

0	XmFtEJUb0ZwMEeXyIgoWQ	Best dive in town!   The burgers here are among the best in town, which is amazing considering what a tiny little place it is. They form each patty by hand and they put it on an amazing roll that absolutely makes the burger. Top notch!  Laid back crowd, decent jukebox, good mix of beers on tap and in bottles, tasty food, and friendly bartenders.   There is just something about the combination of everything it has to offer that just makes it a great place to hang out.
0	rEwomyvRTXHIpUX4W31gxg	so don't get me wrong the place is okay, but i mean i wouldn't travel so far for it  The place is very very spread out. It was standard chinese restaurant service, a little better actually because it was so empty we got most of the attention.   Anyways, the food just really didn't impress me, um good thing though it didn't ruin me 4 hours later...if you know what i mean....
0	NDTwQOEakUKK58eHqR3I2g	The restaurant itself is pretty cool. The music was great, the service was quick and personable,  and the event room our party had for a welcome to Vegas dinner was nice as well.  The problem is that, both, my boyfriend and I got a mean dose of food poisoning and spent our first night in Vegas sick and shut in. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and he had the voodoo shrimp. He really didn't care for the shrimp, but the cornbread was phenomenal. The lobster mac wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty good. I just broke my own rule....don't order crab, lobster, or shrimp from places that don't specialize in seafood.   The food also is pretty pricey but, hey, what do you expect in Vegas? I can't say I'll ever be back after this experience but if you try it out, I heard the wings were awesome.
0	JoUG5ZlGQC7Pj8QoCpARw	We stopped here for a quick bite on our way to our hotel. Let me just keep this short and too the point. If you want a burger and you are staying in the hotel and don't want to go anywhere else by all means eat here. Otherwise save your money. This is a burger king with Jacked up prices because they offer beer. They have a handful of special toppings some sauces and a few special whoppers. And they charge you about twice what it will cost to go down the street to the local burger king and get more menu items and all you can drink soda. They don't do refills  here no this is Whopper bar. The service is terrible the food is just ok so save yourself a few bucks and go to any regular fast food place in the area.
0	OsPNkvcMpweYYy0VCEsPgQ	Woke up with a huge appetite and the $2/4/6/8 menu did the job.  $2 for biscuits n gravy with crispy hash browns satisfied my need for some carbs.  Very large portion for 2 bucks.  Try to beat that at Micky D's.  Dennys coffee is AAAA+ too.
0	hwl3oNVubhHt669pdF2Q	Meal started with cornbread pancakes -  very good - tender, crispy on the edges, with that great conrmeal texture.  Ordered the full order of fried chicken - freshly made, excellent preparation - hot, crispy and great flavor.  Had the mac and cheese, red beans and rice and fried okra - all good, mac and cheese and red beans were authentic southern style and particularly good.  Also had a half order of the short ribs in BBQ - tender and well prepared, very good.  All in all a great southern style soul food meal - high quality and definitely had that homemade quality to it - recipes tasted like family home cooking.  Breakfast menu looked very interesting as well - may go back and give it a shot.  This place is very diner in style and decor - a bit run down but reasonably clean - perfectly appropriate for the type of food and price point.  Service was good and wait staff was very friendly.

There are always wonderful Mexican-Chinese fusion plates, but there are actually available tables to sit at for dinner. To some, this combination may sounds like heaven and to others, a gut-bomb, but no matter.....You must go and try it. It is impossible not to fall in love! I am not sure where "jerk" spices originated, but the food is infused with those tasty flavors as well.   If you have never been to the Chinos before, don't fret. There are samples available of just about everything on the menu. Also, you may want to have the staff walk you through how to order on your first visit, as the process can be a bit confusing. Each meal is topped off with a cookie, usually snicker doodle, but if you are really lucky, you may be blessed with a chocolate lava. Best wishes and go hungry!

We couldn't stay long as we were on our way to an appointment. We'll definitely be back and stay longer just because Crystal made us feel so welcomed!!  LP

We are from Jersey, this is real pizza, not Poppa Johns or Domino's garbage. Everyone is a restaurant critic, but don't know a Damn thing about food. Good pizza, Jersey attitude. Enough said!
0	ZujjrA7KzbXWnumtNvBWKg	I wondered in to check this place out, but its outside appearance made me curious as to what was inside.  Inside is kind of an over the top country/cowboy theme.    In my opinion, more space could be devoted to restaurant seating and less to bar seat, but again just my opinion.  Far more important, the food is fabulous.  The Vaquero salad, may be the best salad I've every had.  Great combination of salad and steak.  The Dr. Pepper marinated steak tacos, didn't work out so well, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the rest of the menu.  Good drinks too.
0	N5y3tzYCFjIlSsiEp1UZw	If you are a rich bunny rabbit this is the place for you. I was not comfortable in this place. My problem, yes. Creamy tomato soup served cold: Disappointed. Crackers like tree bark: tasty but tough to chew. Sandwich of salad tasty but blah blah blah. We all should eat healthy. This place is expensive. I'm out. I'll make my creative salads at home and save $50.00.
0	MJwfoJcgHZZcRxVORd8PQ	I want to like Soga. I love shabu shabu, and this is the only place (I know of) to get authentic shabu shabu in Madison. Their broth is delicious; delicate and reminiscent of the sea, it takes on the flavors of the ingredients you choose to dip.  Unfortunately, the service is tepid, at best. I've been here twice; the first time, we had to wait up by the bar for 5 minutes before anyone would come out and let us pay our check. The most recent time, we still had to get up and try to hunt someone down to pay. You'd think they wouldn't make it so hard to pay....  The last time we went, we ordered Mai Tais. For $6 on the menu, we were impressed with both their balance and their strength. When the bill arrived, we were surprised to see we had been charged $7 apiece. We asked the waitress about the price discrepancy; she apologized, and said their bartender was out for the evening, so they needed to go across the street to Osaka House to source the drinks. While we gladly would have approved had she notified us of this before we ordered, we were not happy to be charged more than we agreed. Plus, no effort was made to correct the error (just "sorry, I should have told you - but that's what it costs"). It wasn't the price that irked us; it was the fact that they didn't disclose what we would actually pay.  Both times we've eaten there, the employees have been on their phones, sitting in the dining room - ignoring customers. This last time, they were eating staff meal an hour before they closed - again, in the dining room. I've been disappointed in customer service and problem resolution. I think 2 strikes is it for this place....
0	tSia2SK6NPVzeE5GNO7zzQ	That is some tasty bingsoo.  Mango sauce.  Yogurt.  Boba.  Now I just need me some green tea to top it off and I'll be good to go.  The two IKEA springy cushion chairs on the wood deck in the front door are pretty sweet if you are lucky enough to score them.  The rule is that when people walk by the store, you need to freeze and pretend like you're a store display.
0	WRG0g9YTCzHCn33jTRzzpg	I have to mention that I eat regularly at this place and always order the same dish because its quality was great. HOWEVER, the quality of the restaurant went downhill since its acquisition in January.  I always order the same tilapia Shanghai style and this time the sauce was watery, the rice was undercook and the veggies were just nasty. So, the food is 1/2 bad...how about the place in general...? I was always impressed by the restrooms...oh...wow...mouth wash, great soap, and nice toiletries. Today, all gone, just a roll of brown paper remains. According to management "customers" do not need that. Even the mints and toothpicks are gone...and good luck finding a prompt hostess...as she is always on the phone taking care of take-outs. On the plus side, service is trying very hard to keep the standards.  If you want an overprice place with medium quality food that does not care for its customers....Mitchell Fish Market galleria is the place to go. Save your money and visit BRGR.  sorry guys....you are not special anymore....
0	rq92qT0MNyg7cp4WOjMQ	When in Phoenix, one expects a lot of tacos, chile rellenos, burritos and the like.  Padre's puts an extra special spin on the standards and then some!\r \r Starters -- chips and salsa?  Hell, no!  Granted, I had to talk my table into the Cilantro Mousse, but yes, the lil' serving bowl was licked clean by the time the Cazuela de Queso Fundido came.  Melted cheese is always fun.\r \r Enchiladas.  Standard Mexican fare.  BUT at Padre's, they serve it up with salmon and spinach.  Tacos.  Standard.  BUT with Duck...amazing!  \r \r Pedro's puts a spin on a standard favorite, but nobody was complaining one bit.
0	zT1K5Sz6a7gWxKKzg8pHQ	My first thought was that the place smelled like my great grandmother's house.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.  Anyway, the decor is decidedly retro-Phoenix.  Stevey P. nailed the decade perfectly.  In fact, my date and I commented on how The Cork'n Cleaver looked we had traveled by time machine to 1978.  Again, this isn't a bad thing.  In fact, I thought it was pretty cool.  I ordered a center-cut New York Strip and let me tell you, this steak was awesome.  Perfectly tender and delicious  The accompanying rice also had a great texture and flavor.  I was very happy with my meal.  The salad bar has to be the stuff of legend.  If you're into making yourself monster salads with all the extras, this is the restaurant for you.  If I had one complaint (and this is what brings the review to four stars), it would be that the Italian dressing really didn't taste like anything.  It was like I was eating wet lettuce.  My date, on the other hand, went safe and picked ranch which proved to be a wise decision.  The service was good.  Not the best in town, for sure, but good.  I'll gladly eat here again.
0	ss5lY8cVsaK9S6tVisvig	Their martini selection is exellent. You have to try the lychee martini. Their steak and side dishes(especially the corn) were great. Definitely a great place for steak. I was also surprised to find that they served the best value burger when i saw my colleaque's entree. It was huge and cheap@@
0	nqTwDlZ2KD0pPaiwevpIQ	This is real Chicago style pizza.  Maybe not quite as good as Giordano's, but pretty darn close and better than you're likely to find around here.  If you're lucky enough to be within the delivery zone, this is the place to get your pizza.
0	QEcg6PwJlU4VaTXnOfaKuQ	As strange as it may seem, I'm pretty sure there were more adults than kids here.  Amazing Jake's is a great place for food, fun, and some sports on the tv.  They have all sorts of silly themed rooms to eat your food in, my favorite (and my husband's favorite) being the sports themed room.  They have a giant projection screen in there where they usually play games on.  The food here is pretty decent.  I am kind of a fan of terrible buffet/cafeteria style food, and AJ's hits it right on the head here.  Yum.  Don't come expecting amazing food.  There is also, of course, a giant area with tons of fun arcade games to make you feel like a kid again.  I had a blast when I went here with my husband.  Amazing Jake's is definitely a fun place to forget about the outside world and be like a kid again.
0	UXHadApqnNjimpoJsjg0Ow	I have been on a wing crazy for several weeks now. We have been talking about trying BWW. We went for a late lunch Saturday. They were busy, but no wait for seating in the bar. We ordered our drinks and had to look over the menu. We ordered the Parmesan garlic wings and the Triple Threat Nachos. When our food finally arived, the wings and nachos were barely lukewarm. The wings were average, different choice of sauces was a plus, but nothing spectacular. The do not have regular plates I guess, since we were given little paper trays. We were not impressed with the food or the service. We will not be returning. The food was way over priced for the quality. Better off going to your favorite pizza place or dive bar for some good wings.
0	7Qx13XL6Ao8D3kuQkJj8w	I've now ordered from Angelina's twice and have sampled several of the foods they have.   All of the food I've ordered was by delivery and delivery is fast and courteous.   The Hot Pastrami and cheese is a hot mess. it was piled high with way to many pickles. The bread was soggy from all the juice and the pastrami itself was burned and dry. It was not juicy red pastrami I am used to seeing but rather brown, dry, burnt around the edges and tasted bitter and not appetizing at all.   The french fries that comes with the sandwiches are not seasoned at all, and are not good. They were old, stale fries.   The pizza was super greasy and the crust was not cooked all the way through so it was quite soggy in the middle.   The ham and cheese cold sub sandwich we ordered was huge and while everything on it was good, it was so piled high it was very hard to eat.   All in all, not the best place to eat and I would look elsewhere for a hot sandwich or pizza.
0	1i723Vgj5FXQxI3fKlVYLw	Growing up in Vegas brings a lot of unique experiences, but one that I can't imagine living without is breakfast at the Omelet House.  There are a few locations throughout the valley, and the quality is the same across the board.  The omelets are freakin' HUGE.  We're talkin' the size of your head HUGE, and they're the best made omelets in town as well.  I watched my (very hungover) roommate once eat an entire one because of the busboy's soft and slightly degrading exclamation of, "Oh, and you almost finished all of it!"  That's the only time I've seen such a feat.  I'm a sucker for the eggs benedict and if you're a fan of slightly fried, slightly mushy, slightly salty, and 100% all delicious things, the potatoes that come with almost every meal are a godsend.  The service can run the gamut between "Holy crap, I can't believe there's already delicious food swirling in my mouth.  It's almost like they beamed it there!" to, "Holy CRAP! I think I need to go change my Depends."  (That last one works best if you're a senior citizen or an astronaut.)  To make this unknown factor more fun and less annoying, place bets on the speed of your service before you arrive.  Just don't try to tip your server with the potatoes.  They may look like gaming chips, but let's not take this too far, shall we?
0	ZzKrn4CQ5xmlku2Sxt8vQ	Ok, I came accross yelp because I was looking for reviews on Brazilian churascurrias. So I picked this one over the one in Scottsdale based on what i read here.   Happy to say I wasn't dissappointed! We did the all-you-can-eat buffet plus meats for lunch for 18 bucks. Well, the buffet was nice. Full of fresh, tasty and interesting dishes. And then there's the meat.....delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked and it just keeps coming.   Its a meat lovers paradise, where the servers are continually walking round with freshly bbq'd meats and they slice you endless slivers of the stuff right at your table.   I was specfically looking for a place like this as I had been to a few in Rio and it was one of my favourite types of food in South America. If I were to compare to the genuine article, I'd say they're no too far off. The places in Brazil probably had more selection but then again i think there may be more selection of meats there at night. I think it may be a little more busy at night too which would help pick up the atmosphere.   Anyway, I stuffed down as much as I possibly could and was happy with the friendly and fast service. thumps up!
0	GwGHPQyljseJCJlKRUL84g	I am constantly surprised at the great restaurants I keep finding in Las Vegas.  Just when I think I have found all the good ones...!  Shuseki (none too modest of a name!) is an Izakaya (tapas if you will) type restaurant.  However, you can also get entrees and even noodles.  Being as that I was here for lunch, I opted for the ramen.  Since most places are pretty bad at doing ramen, my expectations were a little low.  Actually, I was impressed.  They overcooked the noodle a degree or so, but otherwise the soup stock was good.  I had the korean bbq style, which was a bit unorthodox, but was nicely filling with a shoyu base soup.  I also tasted the miso based, which was just fine.  The best part is that the gyoza appetizer was $2.95 for 6 pieces.  Most places have gotten into the habit of charging up to $7 for the same.  Tsk, tsk.  Interestingly enough, though owned by Japanese, the waitress here was not (Chinese, I believe).  So, do not necessary roll in and bust out your Japanese language skills.  Naturally, this place would be in direct competition with another LV izakaya favorite, Ichiza.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on this because I was there for lunch and did not have the izakaya menu.  Judging from the ramen, I would say that this place will do nicely.  During the day, this place is pretty empty, so there is only one waitress and probably one cook.  With only three parties in there, the service was actually kind of slow.  Not a big deal, but good to know if you are in a hurry.  Shuseki is tucked away in the corner of the first floor of the strip mall, so keep an eye out for it.  I did not even realize it was there until this visit there, though I had been in the plaza several times before.
0	2ukWR6qEdO1I4FVoETOw	Ok... so this is real chinese food, but I'm not in china and I like the americanized version.  Had a large group and PF has big tables.  Was really good food, good prices feed 12 for less than 250.    Nice crowd... although there was a guy at the table next to us with a "Pimp" cup... a big crazy jewel encrusted grail???? Couldn'd understand why? but hey...
0	Xza11bI7G6i4t7ZplLVg	The earlier reviews are pretty well spot-on, but I'll add a few thoughts.  Chen's has a good selection, with two primary buffet lines, filled with fairly standard buffet fare.  Then they have a sushi bar, another buffet line with some more exotic items, and a cook-to-order bar (my personal favorite).  Unlike some other places, the cook-to-order selection allows you to fill up on veggies, then hand it to the chef, who will generally add the meat items you choose (you can also ask for shrimp sauce and spice, if you like those).  He generally speaks decent English, so you have a pretty decent shot of getting what you ask for.  I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but what I do eat seems to be pretty good, and the other food seems fresh.  The more exotic items also aren't my typical food, so I can't speak to those.  The other major difference comes in when you go, as others have mentioned.  Namely, go at lunch.  If you go at dinner, the price goes up.  If you go on the weekend at dinner, the price goes way up for crab legs that probably aren't worth the price (and you can't get dinner without crab legs).  So lunch = good, dinner = average and weekend dinner = blech.
0	8dnSdYFRdS2oTZyimoDAhg	Yes there's an older clientele at the Tic Toc, but I've seen plenty of younger people too.  They seemed to have worked out most of the kinks that another reviewer mentioned when visiting last summer, and on a recent visit, our food was good (I noticed some upgrades in ingredients from a previous visit) and served promptly. Every once in a while, the food will take a long time to come out, so it can be inconsistent.  But on the plus side,it's comforting to have a little, old-fashioned Pittsburgh tradition still left in downtown.  On the right day, you can get a great piece of cake too for dessert from Macys bakery, on-site.  We recently had a huge piece of confetti cake which was fresh and delicious.  So don't eat here if you're looking for trendy, but if you're fine with simple, better than diner kind of food (and you're not in a big rush), you'll leave pretty happy.
0	g1aCio27e8rOveLVoktpg	Food was just ok, nothing special. Udon soup is not to recommend, tastes like from supermarket. Unfortunately there is not that much variety of sushi. There are definitely better sushi places in Karlsruhe. Waiters were nice and helpful.
0	Qr3AwnsGGmMlQyUIQumMA	Jukebox is okay, and okay is worth 3 stars, but I get offended by any business who calls themselves "best in the city" to raise my expectations and get me excited only to let me down with their absolute mediocrity.   While it's possible that the absolutely mind-blowing burger I had at world-famous Fergburger in Queenstown, New Zealand ruined me for all future burgers, I actually believe that Jukebox just serves up average stuff. Sure, you can build your own burger at Jukebox, but you can do that at Harvey's too, and I prefer their product (and its price!)   Jukebox has good fries though, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a cool diner, but please don't rant and rave in your ads about being the best when your food leaves this customer feeling that you're nowhere close to the best.   Sorry Jukebox, should'a played a better song.
0	c30ocq6TtVqXhdVT2q6W3w	Why can't there be a decent Chipotle around my area?  Went for lunch with my wife yesterday and the dumb girl and guy making our lunch scooped up the beans and didn't drain them so I got a spoon full of liquid that went running out and they had to switch tin foil twice. He then scooped the mild salsa and got a spoon full of liquid and I had to ask him to please drain that out of my burrito as it was running all over the place. He couldn't get the burrito closed because the soggy shell tore and I though he was going to do a new one but nope, just closed the foil up around it.  I got it to the table and the burrito was a soggy mess and my basket was full of liquid. My wife's salad had a half inch of liquid in the bottom of her bowl and she threw 3/4 of it away because it was soup.  I love Chipotle but hate the two locations that are close to me.
0	kKC0yqAjqG70Io6f2FgYfQ	A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion.
0	MGXoiY4u0HnLxsILhwpDmQ	Honestly, who cares if this is an "Americanized" version of Mexican favorites? It's freaking delicious! The service is usually pretty good as well. I really enjoy the fish tacos with fried (yes, fried!) tilapia. I also particularly like the ultimate fajitas, live guacamole, and queso. They also have really fresh and flavorful salads. There are usually specials for their margaritas which are pretty inexpensive. The best thing: a FREE appetizer of chips and salsa.
0	5TrAJRm2pHHtM2eKBY0Q	I really liked my dessert (the sable) it was definitely the highlight of the meal. In terms of the mains, my scallops arrived cold and over salted, and my boyfriend said his fois gras was just "fine". The atmosphere was extremely loud (similar to a high school cafeteria) and it was interesting having my waiter shout the specials at me. Not at all what I would expect at a restaurant of this type but might be fun if you're a large group and not on a date.
0	zJpsNF9hZtrsYcNFiGTQ	Came here after a little bit of a letdown at another restaurant. Wife had a delicious crab cake and I had the most lobstery (if that's even a word) lobster bisque ever. Very flavorful without the heaviness and a couple of actual lobster chunks. Delicious. Like they took every last bit of lobster flavor out of the lobster.  We actually came here for the 4 x 4 ice cream dessert. Our server was great. Very friendly and helpful. The dessert consists of 16 little dishes, each with a small scoop of ice cream. Now the fun begins... They only let you know one flavor (vanilla). The rest is up to you and your tastebuds. The do have one that's really weird on your plate (we had bacon flavored) but the server was nice enough to tell us which one to be wary of. The flavors change so you can try your luck again at guessing. I will try again the next time I'm back.
0	saf1NIdy3CqtiA9vS3BC6A	Food was pretty good (had a very good steak), service was just average, but the noise level was far too loud. The music was at a level that encouraged strained conversation, which makes for a less than relaxing evening. I don't plan to return soon--too many better options for the money.
0	4dFKG47BgpvmBz6c81WNQ	Well, what was once a great Sunday brunch buffet is now just "ehhhh". I doubt I go back. The Sunday brunch is now $14.99 instead of $19.99 and as a result they have removed all forms of shrimp from the menu, the prime rib has been replaced with a bottom round roast that was so tough I thought I was chewing on my belt. Crab legs are still available though for an additional $6.99 a pound. The free mimosas are gone and you now pay $1.00 each for them but they use a spumante instead of champagne. The turkey I tried was very moist and delicious and the desserts are great but that was the only bright points i experienced. I tried some meatballs from the italian section that were again, very, very dried out which should not happen on a day as busy as Sunday when there is a line waiting to get in. The pot-stickers were bland and flavorless and lacked sufficient filling. Even the salad bar was lack luster in that it was missing basic staples such as croutons, green peppers, hard boiled egg, sliced mushrooms and other salad toppings you would expect like sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. Bottom line is the salad bar at any local Eat-N-Park blows the one at Grandview out of the water. I would rather pay the additional $5.00 again and have the quality back. Until that happens you won't see me back there.
0	q8l1CrS5zu66s4tofwwlQ	From the street, Illegal Jack's looks like a chain restaurant selling unexciting 'tex-mex' food. This is partly true: the food is pretty uninspiring, but surprisingly this place isn't a chain. Inside the restaurant is large, white and empty: it looks unfinished, like the decorators were due to come back and finish it, but didn't because the money ran out. I was enticed there today by the promise of a free burrito, which was duly handed over. I liked that it was made in front of me by a clean and relatively friendly server (kudos to her, she had 1000 of these to make), but I didn't hold out too much hope that I would soon be indulging in a culinary masterpiece. When I got it back to the office, the salsa had made it a bit soggy and it leaked burrito juice all over my desk. It tasted alright, but my judgement was clouded because it was free. I'm not sure I'll be rushing back to pay \u00a35.75 for one.
0	SZRNOy1Yfr6oYroirruvdw	Atmosphere here is nice, live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going. Drinks are good, not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer. The food, well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read "Tapa's" or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco. Not a good deal, not $4 worth either! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else.
0	y3J2RNr5QvpM2GlPifVmQg	Tried this location for the first time on Father's Day. That in and of itself was a mistake as the place was extremely busy and required a 50 minute wait (hostess said 15-20 min). In the meanwhile we checked the place out and reviewed the menu to determine our order.  Finally seated and our waiter takes our order - brings us back our drinks and then disappears. Our coffee and soda's go dry. The table behind us locates their own condiments and refills. Oh, look our waiter returns - long enough to give us a refill and tell us he was bored. Yesterday was evidently much busier and today isn't even a challenge for him. WOW!   So our order comes out and we have to give directions on what needs corrected. We wait while he re-does my wife's order. Which then comes out cold and still isn't correct. Seriously?  I was told how big the sandwiches are, so I ordered a half pastrami, thinking the $8 price tag isn't really as much as it seems, since the sandwich will be the size of a "regular" size sandwich. Um, yeah, that part didn't pan out. I got a small sandwich piled high pastrami and a little cup of cole slaw. The food itself was good, not great like the hype.   Our waiter - yeah, he's missing again and we get no refills. I also noticed management was MIA. He returns long enough to give us the check. There's a mistake on the bill, which he corrects but we of course have to wait and wait.   My final opinion? Too expensive for the sandwich I had and breakfast everyone else in my party had. The food is good but the price to quantity ratio is off. If this place didn't have the fanboys it does, I'd say it was doomed, particularly in today's more cost conscious economy.
0	8H7wkvcZQRADu3KDU7KXw	I was looking for a "I crave sushi today" kind of place in the neighborhood and I think I found it. After reading reviews for this place I have decided to try it. I would say for me mostly what counts is food and I thought it was pretty tasty. I have only been here once and it was a take out sushi (salmon and yellowtail). Salmon was very fresh and tasty but yellowtail was just good. I would come back here, but probably as a take out again as the staff (1 waitress and a man prepping the sushi) were a bit on not very warm/friendly side. P.S. They automatically add 10% gratuity to your bill for take out... (???) Ohhkay....
0	9652e81zftrPi3GiojBWA	Thank you for reminding me why I make my own pizzas. I was excited that Southern Highlands was getting a pizza joint besides Pizza Hut. But 8th Ave fell short of my expectations.  I ordered a whole wheat pepperoni and tomato and a bbq chicken pizza. They were thin, crispy, and flavorful. But they were borderline burnt and overpriced for the size. Call me cheap, but 2 large mediocre pizzas for $32 is steep in my opinion. I ordered take out but the ambiance was dead and depressing. It could've taken cues from HGTV and made it look more inviting. But I liked how they offer whole wheat option. But $2.00 per extra topping, including veggies? Ridiculous.
0	eYIgxwQHmFfLBAtFU5mbcw	So we cheaped out and got the pizza.  I just couldn't stomach paying $27 for chicken tortellini!  Word to the wise:  The pizzas are seriously HUGE!!!!  Please do not order one pizza per person!  That's what we did, thinking we would get meal sized individual pizzas.  Why the server didn't say something is beyond me!  Maybe he thought we really ate that much or something?  We wound up taking almost a whole pizza in a to-go box.  I really enjoyed the bread basket and the olive tray.  It was definitely a nice touch.   I'd come back, but would probably order something else next time.
0	uxOfESvOfmf0074uURgTQ	If you need goat or lamb meat, you can get it here. This wasn't the reason for our trip to Baiz Market this weekend--we went for Al-Hana dining, which was delicious. However, the walk through the grocery portion of this place was great. We picked up some produce and feta cheese [I think they make their own: Confirmed, they make their own!] and overall had a great experience.  I can't wait to go back and take more time to discover some wonderful products and new foods.
0	KIMxQ5Bpbmlf0vzAyFg3Jw	Disappointed. Ingredients and toppings looked like they had been sitting there for a few days undermining the quality and freshness of the Pizza. We asked for basil and the guy took the only packet out of the fridge and it was completely rotten so he threw it all away.   We ordered 5 pizzas and they all came out with soggy crusts. The cooking system may be fast but it pales in comparison to a wood burning oven or even a more conventional electrical system where the crust gets cooked properly and the toppings don't have to be exposed to intense high heat for such a short period of time. I don't mind waiting another 5 minutes for a pizza that is decently cooked.  The concept of choosing your own toppings and designing your own pizza is just a recipe for disaster- it dilutes the identity of the pizza characteristic to the establishment. A pizza's combo of toppings and ingredients should be studied and offered as a tried and tested combination, otherwise you end up with a 'mish mash' of ingredients that just don't marry well together especially when you also have the option of choosing the type of sauce and cheese etc.  The pre-made dough was also a big disappointment- making it one step closer to a store bought pizza. That, in combination with the lack of freshness of the toppings really disqualifies it from being considered a freshly made pizza.  Yes, there are set pizzas too but the pricing just doesn't make sense compared to the build your own.  We gave it a try but won't be back- there are much better pizzas to be had and if you can afford to wait an extra minute or two then why come here?
0	ugWqDho3SadGG7HmneML8A	I think the food here is nice for inexpensive, fast food.  The baked lasagna is pretty killer good.  But what really makes this place awesome is the service.  Seriously, the people that work at this place are so totally kind.  I think it is the management because they are super nice and I think it makes the employees treat the customers really nicely.  If you are sick of rude customer service, go here for a refreshing change!
0	fEgCyM4YLpKXDrYWR2VxQ	I didn't like this place and I won't be back. I've had Mexican/Japanese fusion sushi in Tucson and loved it, but this place is far from any type of traditional sushi and not in a good way. First of all, we couldn't even find the place. We had a groupon so that's how I even heard about it in the first place. I called about 20 times and each time it went straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up. The place has blacked out windows with NO SIGN, just a small flashing neon "open" sign. The atmosphere is weird. It's a very large open space with lots of black furniture and a dance floor? It looks either very unfinished or like a grimy sports bar, since it has huge tvs and a huge bar that covers one entire wall. I didn't find the wait staff too friendly, well trained, nor professional. It took over 45mins to get our three rolls. We had to ask for obvious things like dipping plates, soy sauce, etc. I agree with some of the other reviews that their orders are large and we had plenty leftovers. I also agree that the food here is extra unhealthy. Everything is either deep fried or overly covered in mayonnaise-based sauces. We ordered the tootsie, volcano and carne asada and the carne asada was the best, although it was deep-fried. I didn't feel like I had a healthy meal, good service nor a pleasant surrounding environment.   Also, I used their restroom and of the two stalls, one had the toilet seat broken and laying on the floor and the other had a door that didn't close properly. =/
0	9tVhN8ikkhfl0tG1M2j6JQ	Great chinese food. I went here for my lunch break yesterday and was impressed with their lunch special.   Food: I had the General Tso's chicken special. It comes with char sui fried rice, vegetable chow mein, either crab rangoon or an eggroll, hot and sour or egg drop soup, and the entree. The entree as well as the dish were freshly prepared. It wasn't oily or overly salty. They even garnished my dish with broccoli.   Service: The food was prepared within 10 minutes of ordering, and the staff was really friendly.   Price: Great value for under $7. I was surprised it came with so much. I ate half of it and had to eat the other half later since there was so much.   Misc: Its in a Smith's shopping plaza, but its kinda quiet inside. Delivery can take long since there is only one driver, but it'll be worth the short wait.
0	evZPsRmQD75xYLUb8NRqQ	Had our daughter's 3rd bday party there and it was a big hit with the kids.  Was a bit crazy with all the kids but was great fun! The best part was that I didn't have to clean up after!! The kids loved all the games. Highly recommend to parents of young kids!
0	V211o8L1AxFryYtqPjFg0g	Asian fusion is about right - the Thai curries basically come across as a mess that really taste nothing like Thai curry I've had in more authentic Thai restaurants. I have tried a few other dishes and at least give them points for trying - the meals typically look colorful and appetizing and with enough fish sauce, chili paste, or soy sauce, you can transform it into something edible. Other pros, the dishes don't seem greasy which is a plus to me. The prices are also super reasonable.
0	pucIWEKzi67piyRueUWOZw	This is a pretty small place but very fresh and delicious. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the portions were small but it was also cheaper than your average Korean restaurant.  We opted for bbq ordering the kalbi, shrimp, and beef brisket. The brisket was soooo amazing, sliced ultra thin and super marbled with fat. It just about melts in your mouth and I wished the portion was about 4 times as big as it was. The kalbi was standard but the shrimp was disappointingly tiny. There were only 6 smallish shrimps in our order.  The side dishes were tasty but only about 6 were served. We weren't served any soup either! Overall, the food was really good but I wished the portions were bigger!!
0	aKwpo0JdSNyvPKemKLWtvw	The food is awesome and I love this place. You should try the fried rice with chicken or tofu, the pad thai is one of the best that I have eaten, the green and red curries are delicious. Most of the food in this restaurant is really good and good value for the price! I would highly recommend this place.
0	g6ZqnAcQNJPG62hpv8tvA	Pastries look decent, taste decent. Prices could be lower. Bought 2 coffees and 2 pieces of pastry and 1 loaf of bread for $19. That's a price you can charge people only once. Please be friendlier to entering customers. A simple welcome is all we ask. Please adjust your prices so people can just 'stop by' instead of 'planning' a visit. Again, greet people and thank people for their visit, so they feel appreciated for their business.
0	YpyYPUDNb3k2Lq1sDLjAQ	Had sushi here with a friend who came from CA and stayed at this casino.  Although sushi took some time to make, rolls came out super fresh and the service was excellent.  Cozy little place to eat at this casino.  Very satisfied.
0	YI28r7TiTbHSVMxZlAW08g	Relatively lazy service (can't get a refill on your coffee to save your life) OK food (no kids breakfast menu, though, so my kids had to split a regular entree) The "healthy" omelet I had was cooked in so much oil that I didn't feel so healthy afterwards Apparently, people regularly chew tobacco here.... at their table.... first thing in the morning... because when I asked for a paper cup (to give to my toddler) I was asked if it was to use as a spittoon, since that's what most people ask for them for.  Gross.
0	9hW9rO8qLHXwSerAyN6pA	Went to this location one night to grab some food. The commercials and ads running at the time were for the $5 late night snack boxes. I went at night to grab one, and placed my order. The guy literally yelled at me telling me they didn't sell those anymore and got mad at me because I needed an extra minute to place my new order. I was treated so poorly that I just decided to leave and go somewhere else. I totally realize people have bad days and I was not expecting 5-star service. However, I should never have been yelled at for an honest mistake.
0	pqdAHn7vfnGErXb87xbaPg	The main reason why I was attracted to this Taqueria was because when I was vegan, they were able to cater to my dietary needs which, wasn't so trendy 6-8 years ago. And for being a Mexican joint, surprising that they knew what that even meant.   The carne asada is good on anything...along with the chicken.  Located near UNLV, we eat there when jonesing for some good Mexican food.   And to us students it's the little things that matter...they have great salsa and give you chips with every order!
0	aYaHUGXXbgtiywKNcvxy1w	My bestie tried the fish tacos and I indulged with the chicken/steak fajitas.  Fajitas are always a winner... I mean it's pretty hard to mess those up.  The fish tacos were great.  The only thing lacking was the service :(  I hate being pitched... this guy was trying to make a quick buck and was so busy trying to up-sale everything he kept forgetting what we needed or asked for.  The manager Ashley is wonderful and helpful and really seems to have a firm grasp on how important the customers are to her line of work.  Our server- not so much.  On a side note... all the servers seemed pretty miserable.
0	ZB7vYqp1apbc2FUaHpOKMw	We have been sitting in the drive-thru for 15 minuets and there were only 3 cars ahead of me, there is still 1. This is the slowest taco shop ever! If my food is good I will change the stars. It's 1:40pm, not even a busy time.
0	poaO4qh2IEkcrI8UGn8RCQ	Probably the best Chinese buffet in the Charlotte area, but that's not saying much. This place is almost always packed, so expect a long wait - more than an hour at peak times.  Very large restaurant with a lot of seating, look out for the hidden stairs that seem to be everywhere. I'm not sure why they decided to add that little complication, but they did. Really handy when you're carrying a plate of food and a bowl of soup.  Sushi, always my first stop, was fresh. One area of rolls and another of fish, it was being made right there and there was plenty of it. Eel, salmon, tuna, plus sashimi in some sort of sauce. Not a very wide variety, I'm afraid. The holder with hand rolls only had one eel the whole time I was there.  There's a soup bar (I think that's what it was) where you can have the chef add your stuff to it and he cooks it up right there. There's also a grill nearby which is turning out fresh dumplings and grilled tofu and some other stuff.  The steam tables were always stocked and not just with the Americanized Chinese food. There were quite a few more authentic options, including some strange looking cuts of beef and chicken that I've not seen elsewhere in Charlotte. And the usual Pork Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and the Crawfish that everyone seems to like (though I don't!). Of course, french fries and fried potatoes and cheese sticks and even tacos!  Lots of wait staff, so drinks are always refilled and dirty plates are picked up quickly.  Would I come here again? Maybe on the weekend when I am willing to wait. The non-crab legs hours seem to be a lot less expensive.
0	UXxeeX4Mgg4h0gxmoTJW2g	A watery egg drop soup comes with the lunch special. A crunchy but skinny veggie egg roll with thick sweet and sour sauce is also party to the lunch special. I got the kung pau beef it was spicy and yummy fresh onions and green bell peppers that were good and not over cooked. The accompanying noodles were over cooked and turning into mush the fried rice was well just kind of bland and boring.  The staff was very attentive. Not bad in a pinch, but there are better fastfood chinese places.
0	bquB2pnOSG07oo3O0Jj6Q	This is a very nice bar and restaurant.  Great atmosphere, great beer and some very good dishes.   I once had a fish dinner on a friday night that was very good.  We once ordered burgers to go and those weren't as good as we expected. I have always had good service here.  Not excellent but good.
0	Up2pavYvxDz1nxOs3z6whw	Just when I thought I was sick of pizza, I ended up at Barro's. I've never seen such a squadron of youngsters so friendly and helpful. When they say "20 minutes", my pizza's ready in 15. These kids are on the ball.  The crust? Not too thin, not too thick. Just right. Tasty. Soft. Sauce? Great! Not too thin, just the right amount, not too salty or tangy. Great cheese, generous toppings. My mouth is watering. So many specialties I have to try...I wonder about that kona pizza with terryaki sauce, chicken, and pineapple. Sounds yummy.  It's also nice that they're always doing some sort of fundraiser in there; they really enjoy giving to the community. This is not your average parlor.
0	nyiyFeaOnS4enoFsBtKTw	Before there was Aroma, I thought iced vanilla lattes were supposed to taste bitter and burnt (thank you Espresso Royale...).  Now I know they are supposed to be sweet, creamy, fragrant, and oh so good.  Aroma has some of the best coffee I've ever had (but it's definitely not cheap), as well as a variety of delicious real food.  Store is cute, with a nice patio out back, but it's not the biggest place and if you're looking for a place to study and it's after lunch, you'll probably be out of luck here.  Otherwise, it's one of my favorite places to camp out (provided I woke up early enough on a Saturday morning).
0	R8FORN8ILxvbtE7phAXlw	Been here so many times. It became one of my to-go joint every time I go home from my clinicals. Love their Pad thai and Pho! The Pho is a little different in this place, its has more flavor in it than any other pho I've tasted, probably because of the celery. (Yes, celery) Best thai ice tea in town hands down!! I enjoy their Mongolian beef and Tom Yum soup as well! I love the service, they serve their food pretty quick. The only thing I'm concern about is the tray area is a tad filthy and they could've clean the area more often than leave plates their for some time. But who gives a damn... they got the best food ever!
0	7p0FwH294pj3dQKYwf2w	We use this Einstein Bagel as a base for our cycling group on Saturday mornings often.  Love that they have outdoor tables with umbrella's for us to sit in while we watch our bikes.  Great coffee, good sandwiches (a favorite is the eggwhite, asparagus, and swiss sandwich), and for us cyclists.... easy access to our cycling routes.  We'll be back often....
0	nXNA19ZkQhTg9x64FDExw	This is easily the best Roberto's in the valley. I used to go to the one on DI and Durango but they charge you extra for using a debit card. I found this one on Trop and Ft. Apache and it is just as good, if not better. The interior is really nice, large and well lit. Plenty of places to sit down. The salsa bar is also better stocked and cleaner. I always get the Carne Asada Nachos with extra pico de gallo but that was just too much food for me today. Instead I settled for the Shrimp burrito. This burrito was on point. Just a tad too much rice but onions, green peppers and large shrimp were really good. Make sure you get the spicy version for a good kick.
0	d9gtZNIkqno7kS1zAjne9A	Had the eggs benedict and cheese grits.   Both were good, but nothing out of the ordinary...   I particularly liked that they had donut holes from Dunkin Donuts along with coffee in the waiting area....  While we didnt have to wait long, I definitely filled up on SEVERAL of the cinnamon, powdered sugar donut holes.
0	4td9seGXxVWH0kBjWBXQ	I'd rate the food 4.5 stars.  We had dinner here last Friday:  Hubby and I shared the rib-eye steak (an order is $100 meant for 2 people) as well as the spaghettini with lobster. washed down with 2 bottles of red wine.  For appetizer, the group (6 of us) shared the calamari, tripe, prosciutto and the salad that evening which is absolutely to die for:  cherry tomato with cube fresh mozzarella and lastly for dessert we had the sorbete and gelato, pear and coffee gelato.  Oh! FYI! my friend ordered the fish I think it was red snapper) and you should skip this, she didn't finish her entree as it was bland and overcooked.  We brought our favorite red wine but were informed that they do not allow outside wines to be opened in the restaurant.   The waiter was knowledgeable and The service was outstanding all throughout the meal except towards the end when our waiter asked if we wanted dessert and the ladies all declined.  but we later changed our minds and decided to have the sorbete and gelato.  At that point, the waiter had already closed our tab (which I don't think is a big deal) and he had a sudden change of attitude towards us.  I don't really see why he's be annoyed when that would mean additional charges thus, additional service charge but well it was late in the evening.  Overall the dining experience and the dishes that we ordered were outstanding.  I would recommend this restaurant anytime, I will probably eat there again next time we are staying at the Venetian.
0	IxnsUHeAV21LoyTE1Y7C2A	Great place for the money, awesome food and atmosphere, rivals many higher priced places on quality.  Only gripe was they were out of a few things I would have liked to have ordered on a night that it wasn't busy at all, but they made it worth it.
0	tOPTA43WY7TgHTlyl2TXw	The ultimate cheeseburger is really good! The fries don't compare to McDonald's fries (I think only in-n-out's really do), but they do have good burgers. I've also really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki bowl. It seems kind of random to be on the menu, but I like it.
0	RLyxxkpMDleFsguJb1xmA	We have gone to this Friday's several times. It's adequate. The food is decent. The atmosphere is fun. The Irish Car Bombs are excellent. :) The service can be hit or miss, but apparently the managers are reading these Yelps cuz the service has gotten considerably better.   What makes this restaurant stand out for us is Kara. The last couple times we've come to Fridays, we were served by Kara. She is a FANTASTIC server. She is friendly, professional, and gets our orders right no matter how many in our party. She doesn't forget things or make you feel like you are bothering her. She is GLAD to have you as a guest. I realize that might be what a server is SUPPOSED to do, but you guys know as well as I do that's not always the case, especially with chains.   Just like with any chain, your service can be hit or miss, but give this Friday's a chance and you might just be surprised at the improvement.
0	ap6UlbB18W1g5OyIehRoA	This is my mom's favorite breakfast place, so naturally we took her here in our Mother's Day celebration on Saturday.  We arrived at about 10:30 or so and as usual, the place was jam-packed and I could barely squeeze through the doors to get my name in.  We were quoted at about 20 minutes for a table of 3 and within 20 minutes we were seated.  Good, because I was starving.  There are quite a few things that appeal to me on their menu.  I am a big fan of their "heartier" pancakes.  You know, the kind that are loaded with nuts and berries and other healthy crap.  They are all very good.  This time I went with an omelet.  I chose the same thing as the husband did, a pear, bacon, sliced almond, and havarti creation.  I thought it sounded a little weird, but I am a sucker for bacon and havarti.  The omelet was delicious.  It was a generous portion and all of the flavors melded together beautifully.  I loved the differences in texture in every bite.  The omelet was also served with potatoes that are so-so and an english muffin.  By itself the english muffin was pretty lame, but if you add the apple cinnamon jelly that sits on the table, it's incredible.  I LOVED that jelly.  It was really really good, and I don't even like cinnamon.  The things that suck about this place are: the layout - it's very jumbled and sometimes I think the servers forget you; the servers outfits - I can't stand looking at the poor girls wearing high waisted khaki mom jeans, it's downright painful; the wait - whenever we come here, I am starving and it kills me to have to wait outside in the AZ heat.  Overall though, this is a nice place.  I enjoy coming here whenever we're out in the EV with my family.
0	NVqqYehU9RTRWLvXJb3bA	Service is great and very welcoming. Came here yesterday to see the Steelers, Go STEELERS!, pre season football game. Place is spacious and nice with an area of pool tables, games and big screen tvs everywhere. Literally, I was here for only 10 mins, since the steelers games was not showing, I was asked by 3 bartenders at 3 different times if I needed anything to drink or eat. Love that the bartenders are attentive and cool. Can't wait to come back for more than 10 mins on my next visit to try the food.
0	sfrt22AC8b246Nmpfxz6w	This is a typical CPK in the smaller part of the Fashion Show mall (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rXUBAFqrr00KvVEJ6aNURw?hrid=OYsZi4R_-xj0UuVtTe5vPg).  If you're looking for take-out, head to the left of the seater and find the door near the rear of the restaurant.  CPK offers unusual selections (like BBQed chicken pizza) and delicious soups and salads.\r \r Vegan Report: Their vegetarian Smashed Pea and Barley soup is awesome.  I also love the Thai Linguini without chicken and the Thai Crunch Salad without chicken.
0	ROmCIPf1GkOQE4tlnA2lg	The Capital Grille has some pretty good steak, though I was not totally blown away -- everything was good, but there was nothing surprising or new. The wine selection is amazing, or maybe that was just the good taste of the guy in my group. Try the fresh berries with cream for dessert. Definitely better with an expense account!
0	A0zIlT3HJkPDaUi7cZbuA	Average sub shop. The Service wasn't very good, very unorganized, (we paid before they asked what kind of cheese/toppings we wanted) and overall just "blah". The pasta salad had no flavor, and the sandwich/food options mediocre. The soda selections were RC (yuck). Nothing out of the ordinary, or to make me want to come back.
0	iP4BZN12WFdgARqFWeHz3Q	I'm generally not a fan of restaurant chains--more of a local ingredients gal--however, Chili's is a solid, comforting option on long workdays or to meet up with pals. The margaritas, presidente and chambord 1800, are soothing escapes. The fajitas, in their sizzly goodness, are a tasty way to fill your belly. And, of course, the soup and salad combo (at around $6) cannot be beat with a giant stick. Chicken enchilada soup paired with a house salad with guacamole ranch. Seriously, mmm. Second fave is the black bean burger . . . wait, the tilapia . . . no, the buffalo salad. You feel me. The key reason for my review is to commend Danielle at the takeout counter. When I called, she was polite, thorough and charming. I was even more impressed how she handled the order, specifically that she double checked the to-go bag for all the dressings, utensils and even tortilla shreds (soup garnish). She is a reflection of what service should be, and it was awesome to be reminded that whatever your calling, you should take it to the nth degree. Hop off the 202 and enjoy.
0	pnhIUtab2u6Sgd3AcP7b6g	I had lunch at the bar this week.  the service was horrible, she had a major atttitude, and only smiled when she delivred the check.  I ordered ice tea, had to ask for sweetner,  had to stir the sweetner with my fork.  I enjoyed the soup and sandwhich, as the procuitto was delicious,  the whole experience could have been better had the bartender been the slighest bit nice and friendly.  This was my 5th time to the resturant,  will definetly go back, but will avoid the blonde bar tender at all cost.  Table service is always friendly and helpful....  She needs to go away......
0	b1ArF6GZYt3630MtyUd5g	As much as I loved Stratta the last time, I had to budget a bit this time and get food that is actually worth my money. I found this Buca on the GPS to be very close to the Hard Rock. Infact it was just down the street from the Hard Rock on Flamingo. I came here on a Sunday evening, and there was next to no one here at 6pm. It took a total of 2 minutes to get seated.   The menu is exactly like any other Buca's around in Socal. I ordered the Quatro Al Forno which comes with 4 different kinds of pasta and a meatball on the side. The total after tip had to be less the $20. This wouldn't buy me a single plate of food at the Wynn. The management there was very friendly. I remember them asking me how the place compared to the ones in Socal. I lied and told them its superb, when really it was on the same level. Its a franchise, what else can you expect but some good proportioned Italian cooking at the Buca?
0	gLGHP7CCvopsoY9Ne46vg	So i have heard some pretty good thing about this place so i decided to give it a try one day.  The restaurant was very dirty inside which kind of makes it hard to enjoy a meal. I got fried chicken with mac n cheese and fries. The chicken was extremely salty to the point where i couldnt even eat it. The fries tasted like they had been cooked in the same fry bin as fish which made them pretty hard to eat as well. As for the mac n cheese it was bland and not to my liking. On the upside the service was very good, but i can guarantee i wont be back.
0	lBoSiGAYjsZbhNE4Y1Vnw	You get what you pay for, this is delicious greasy new york style pizza. Our first pizza joint when we first moved here, they deliver and satisy that urge for greasy cheesy pizza! I would not waste your money on teh wings, they are not very good but their garlic knots are pretty good is they have any left when you are ordering your food. I heard they have great lunch specials too!
0	I0ECLtxWdt54uPluwBQWA	How weird. It's a food court with Bojangle's, Dairy Queen, and Donato's. The Morrison Farms Cafeteria is another food option (that's where the cafeteria comes from). I went because I was craving a chicken strip basket from DQ and the employees told me to go somewhere else since they didn't serve it (they should have just told me no DQs serve the chicken baskets and saved me another trip).   Anyway, the location is prime in South Park, but the concept is so strange. When does anyone go to a food court that is not in a mall or in a large business office?! Or if this is a cafeteria restaurant, why share the space with other fast food chains?
0	FelpbVfQtkk0JXk8TJtoEQ	Went for lunch yesterday.... was self seating.  Server came right away for drink order.  Disappears for a while then food irder.  35 minutes later no food.  We asked of the ssrver.... as she had not been back to the table and "it's just about done"  it was a french dip and a San Francisco grilled cheese.  Seriously?  Left.  She comped us and apologized.  Lived here for 15 years.  This place has gone downhill
0	uVcj6QIT8sTfj0gK5TPA	As much as I like to patronize local establishments and small business in general, Roman is more style than substance.  Food portions are small, beer is overpriced and the service is hit-or-miss. Maybe it's just me being a young guy but as far as getting what you pay for,  there is better quality and value to be had.
0	r6apF44CRf1N0cXV1808Fw	What the HECK SnS??? You totally let me down today! Being the "Yelper" amongst my friends I convinced a group to wait in line for an hour to be one of the first to try this hot new place....and you made me look so bad.  Downers:  1) They forgot our shakes and brought them after our meal was served and almost finished 2) They forgot our order and we had to hunt someone down to get it put in. 3) Everything was wrong on everyones order except one burger. YIKES! No cheese, no bacon, forgot to take the onions off... disaster! When we asked for the cheese the waitress put a cold slice of cheese on the burger and brought it back. WTHeck. 4) When the manager came to the table he was not at all concerned about all that went wrong with our experience and did not want to take care of us at all. Finally he suggested giving us our shakes for free (the ones they forgot to order and brought after our meal) Really???  5) The meat in the burgers were really small, nothing at all like the photos. It similar to the size of the kids meal McDonalds burger. Disappointed for sure! 6) There is no bathroom in the restaurant and you have to go out to the casino to go..if you have too go :)  Some Pluses:  1) The shakes were awesome - once we got them :) 2) The taste of the meat in the burger was really good....just really small.... 3) The hostess at the front had the best guest service. She was the one who noticed that no one had brought our food or shakes out and rushed around to make it right. She was awesome and should be manager! 4) Price - the price was decent. They even had $4 menu that gave you a burger and fries for $3.99. Thats a pretty great deal! 5) I love the South Pointe and think it is a great idea to have it inside the hotel.  Overall - this place has nothing on In-n-Out. Not worth a hour in line wait at all. I might give this place a second go in a month or so and see if anything has changed. I totally understand that bumps have to be worked out in the beginning but as of now......not impressed.   Steak - n - Shake.....I'm still not over what you did to my good name today...not yet anyways.
0	9t8CMHNEA01HWzVSlwn9eg	it's basically byrd's with different waitstaff and slightly better food*. same mostly dismal beer selection save a few local and/or craft brews. if you like miller lite, sports and fried food, you will love this place.   * the appetizers were ok, but mostly fried (green beans, poppers, curds, etc.). my friend ordered a grilled portabella (which was on a nice ciabatta roll and came with decent sweet potato fries)... and found a large piece of plastic in her sandwich. gross enough to begin with, but leads me to believe that they don't even use fresh ingredients, because it looked like a wrapper. yuck.
0	7OpHZAYIJm6zuc8S1nQQ	The food was good but the service will keep me from coming back. The refills took a good 25 minutes and the food took double that to come out. There was no one in the restaurant and we were given our entrees with no explanation as to what was going on when we asked. I seriously am worried about the success of this restaurant if all of their new guests looking to participate in their opening month, have this same experience. Next time I go somewhere for lunch and drop over $15 per person, I will think twice where I take my business and make sure I go to a company that acts as if they appreciate my coming in.
0	0I2o2FhqFfaW4EEYwQWDgg	I am suprised there arent that many reviews of this steakhouse, it's an amazing value.  I am a local and work downtown.  Over the course of a few months I decided to try every steakhouse in the Fremont area so I knew where to take friends and family who visited.  My steak of choice is they Ribeye, and this joint delivers.  Medium rare, comes on a bed of potatoes with the crispy onions on top?  Why doesnt every steak have crispy onions on top??? Just sayin...  Add a side salad and you're good to go for less than $30.  Then take the $10 you saved on your huge steak and tip your server well!  O, who was the winner of the steak-off?  There isn't one, you're in Vegas and they all know steaks.  They aren't $1.99 though =)
0	nty0UlhZse2eJYlDuJM6Q	Went in for pizza 6 weeks ago and while I waited for the longest time I received a parking ticket in their stupid lot. They must have called my car in thinking I took their spot or some b.s. well the pizza wasn't worth the wait nor the ticket. The dough was clearly not fresh and the toppings tasted soapy. Sauce was good but that is about all.
0	2DqgO4O0f6AHmVbAl8lsA	Zouki's is a Lebanese themed court food joint that one can order a some quick grub, take a break and get back to shopping within the Carrefour Laval shopping center. As an avid lover of Lebanese food, I couldn't resist trying this place out.  So, what exactly is Zouki? It's this crepe-like bread that you use instead of Pita. I opted to try it out though for those who don't Pita is available. I couldn't resist ordering the Felafel. Sadly, it was very underwhelming with a mere 2 balls of Felafel that fell flat. I don;t know what it was but the whole thing was very underwhelming. Was it fresh? Was it well made? This is not the Felafel I tend to eat from multiple locations that I can order it from. The Felafel needs to be better or simply not offer it at all. The Zouki experience was bland. Perhaps I like the Pita more.  I opted for the Garlic potatoes and a V8 juice to compliment my trio. All in all, it cost me about $12, around the same price one would expect from such places. The garlic potatoes were good.  Would I come back? Maybe for the shish taouk pita. We'll see. However, many other options in this food court are available.
0	TdRexJES0MVLpvjKaVpIQ	Their spicy tuna rolls are enough for me to sign away my first born. Okay, not my first born, but I'll gladly pay whatever I have to to get another taste of them! They were so fresh and I felt like the fish melted in my mouth. I mean, maybe I'm eating sushi that isn't quite so good, but compared to any of the other places I've been in the past, this place has to have the best. I recommend also getting the yellow tail sashimi ... I think when the waiter announced what it was, I didn't think it would taste good, but it did! It tasted like citrus... oh boy.  I wish I tried more stuff, but alas ... so little time.
0	ko1lrp6kNOffvZOrSlAdQ	The food is decent and you choose your ingredients. The kids cooking do a good job, BUT the wait staff is really slow and they do not have their act together. They really go into too much detail on how the place works, it's pretty simply, big bowl is the stuff you want, the little bowl is your seasonings and sauce, take it to the grill and tell them if you want rice, noodles, wrap... Then the fun begins, after it's cooked these kids seem to get confused when they try to deliver the bowl. The first time they asked if I was David, "No David is the waiter, I am Jeff like it says on the card" Duh! Slow refills on drinks, we ordered a dessert and it took longer to get than our entire dining experience. Our check was wrong, blah blah blah...... Good food, the wait staff needs to grow up and be re-trained. Maybe one day they can have a section where you don't have to deal with a waiter? and stop playing such krap background music!
0	cqwIBBYlLM9JpoYCmjS2VQ	Next to Bankok Orchid in Henderson, this is one of the best Thai places in the greater Vegas area.  The staff is super friendly and very attentive (without smothering you).  Their tom kha gung soup is delicious with plenty of mushrooms and shrimp (or chicken) and very flavorful.  The prices are reasonable and the value is definitely there. I never leave hungry!  The decor is lovely and even the waiters wear colorful thai clothing which just adds to the whole experience.
0	PzGZcPbc5CYCVnR6YhIpug	Decent enough food for pre or post work out. Staff is not friendly. The majority of times I have ordered has not been a pleasant experience. I called to obtain the nutritional information of menu items and was met with "we dont know but they are healthy"........sure ok buddy. So lrt me get this srraight: a cafe in a gym whos slogan is "nutrition to fuel the body" doesnt have access to or is aware of the nutritional content of their own food. Gotcha.
0	JyqyIEzbvKCmYcc6r1ukMA	I really love Cafe Carumba! I came here for both a lunch and dinner on this trip to AZ. The service is great no matter what time of day. The food is consistently good. I had an awesome burger with portobello mushrooms, brie and pancetta...Yum! I also had the sweet potato fries which are so good! I washed it all down with some heavenly patron margaritas. For dinner I ordered the cobb salad...not my fave. The chicken was tossed in something that tasted like strawberry pancake syrup...it was really sweet. Our waitress was so nice and accommodating. She took my salad back and brought me one with plain chicken which was very good. I also had the beef churrasco-skewers of marinated beef tenderloin, which was delicious. Oh, and of course more patron margaritas.
0	LC1SaCO2U2mnRLQnXtglQ	All Port of Subs are not created equal. I've lived down the street from this place for about a year now and every time eat there they have fresh toppings and very friendly service. My girlfriend and I have made it one of our regular lunch spots.
0	J0NN51Keb7m3FxbXumWA	This place is a hit or miss when it comes to getting your food made correctly.  I would say the last 3 times I have eaten here, they have messed up my order, wow!  My husband does take out here often and they had the incorrect pick time even though he repeated it 3 times over the phone.  I think PF Chang's really needs to take a look at the company they use for call in orders.  I believe it's a 3rd party company that takes the phone orders.     I gave this location 4 stars because the service has always been stellar, besides the cooks making my food extra spicy instead of NOT spicy.  Its situated at Kierland, so you can take a nice stroll after you fill up on too much Pad Thai.    Overall, I do enjoy coming here once and a while.  A major plus for me is they offer a dairy-free menu!!!  This makes it easy for me to pick and choose what I can eat.  Just ask your server and they will print if off for you.  I think the happy hour is great as well.
0	FF5StHg83TfHE7Z4tHcqw	The family and I stopped in yesterday for a little Italian cuisine. The waitress was great and spot on with her service. The ambiance was very nice at the beginning of our visit as they just opened. Toward the end of our meal it got a little loud music-wise but great if you love Billy Joel.   On to the food- The food was delicious except for a few setbacks. The Gnochi left a little bit to be desired, a little too thick for my liking. As for my entree, the Lasagna, while very delicious, it's the first Lasagna dish that I have ever seen that had about only two layers of noodle stuffed with cheese/meet. A little lackluster to say the least  Stuffed mushroom appetizer rocks!. As does the Mozzarella Enough said  Final points 1. Taste of some items were great but dragged down by others 2. Pricing - A bit overpriced based on the above
0	DWEmXrussiP4KVq4QG7aA	things that keep me coming back for more, despite my budget: cheese & cured meat platter.  artichoke fritters.  quail in red wine reduction (served on a bed of delightful crispy potatoey stick-tangles).  and biggest draw of all: BEST MARINATED OLIVES. EVER.  hands down.  I don't even LIKE olives.  sometimes I stop here to get an order of olives to go.  they're outstanding.  And their sangria might be the best you'll ever have.  dead serious.  pay the high price for that pitcher at least once.  you have to try it.
0	tpQs1aWFJu8RxcxyMkPlVg	I love Chili's. This location is iffy sometimes when it comes to service but the food is always good. I love the cheese steak and usually don't stray from that. Sometimes we order the sampler if we go during happy hour yo have some yummy munchables while sipping our margaritas.   I do love the options they have for blended drinks!  If you sign up for their e-mail list you can get cool coupons that are worth it and help a bit with the bill or allow you to try something you hadn't before.
0	3MP6nI78BQfcYowY05GSA	I really really really hate to do this, especially when I went here with the breakfast club.....but it really was disappointing (ahhh I'm sorry!...just must be honest). We went last weekend and we did have a large party and the place was busy so I will give them that. The coffee was great, it was strong and tasty. I ended up ordering the 'poached eggs' or what most people know as a bene and the BF got the pancakes. My bene had overdone eggs...the yolks weren't runny at all....you cut into them and they just stayed where they are...wah wah. The whole thing was just ok, but nothing I would go back for. I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of for me with benes...). I had it with bacon, and the bacon was alright, but not as crunchy as I like. The BF thought his pancakes were heavy and lacking in flavor. Aaaanyway, we did have a great time here, but the food just didn't live up to my expectations and the price was high considering it wasn't that good (we ended up paying about 35$ after tip and all.....yikes!).
0	vyMDryov8UjEvMOSUtbCHA	The big question on the minds of BBQ lovers in the valley is Memphis or Lucille's. Well, I hate to be the spoiler but its a tie. It depends on the thing your after. Lucille's offers large portions of their signature BBQ with the cooker right in the dining room! They have a fantastic southern drink menu with things like mint julep on it. This place is always busy and has a great outdoor patio. They offer both Memphis and Texas style BBQ which is good, but always makes me wonder if they would do one better if they focused. The take out is awesome though!!! A great night in the district if your interested in good BBQ none the less.
0	4QN8wYWcctwsegEgaBfh8Q	Have been at this place at least 10 times already. Unfortunately my friends don't know better. They keep coming back to this place because of life music, Russian food and ambiance. Yeah you've read right Italian place that serves Russian food. Well I am certain that the cook speaks Russian and for many times that I've been at that place haven't seen anything Italian. Regarding food, well that's why I give low rating. I'll say only that my mother on a bad day makes better food. Should be enough. So if you wanna come to meet some Russian chicks or just meet Russian people, have some vodka and listen or dance to Russian music go there on Friday or Saturday nights. Oh and it's expensive considering the food you get.
0	ob9c0f2J5mMpiKiIiDlBg	Go about noon on Sunday and there is a mariachi trio.  The Nana's Special for breakfast cannot be beat:  huevos al gusto, \u00a1 the red Chili ! , potatoes/ refried beans and really good flour tortillas.  My out-of-town visitors always request that I take them back.  Note:  I am from San Antonio and cannot rate more than four stars for any Mexican food in Arizona.
0	5yP8vZoKVBb5JftiSfS1vg	I went to Kaya for lunch with a Yunzer friend. Veg options weren't abundant, but the lone veg lunch entree, Jamaican green curry, was solid. I particularly enjoyed the saffron rice.  Decor and service were both pleasing. Another success pulled off by the big Burrito Restaurant Group!
0	BMBNJJDWbu198zKi5z9vqw	I get takeout from China Inn a couple times a month on average. So far everything I've had has been pretty good.  I'm a big fan of their Mongolian Beef.  The beef and chicken fried rice is good as well. The only complaint I have is sometimes the Mongolian beef is more onions than beef. Maybe that's because I go there later in the evening shortly before closing time and I get what's left of the beef.  I don't eat in, but I can describe the restaurant decor as your typical tacky Chinese restaurant decorations like the ceramic Fat Buddhas and ceramic lucky cats on the counters. The dining room is pretty much the same- Chinese fans on the wall, etc.  I'd visit China Inn more often if the prices were a bit lower. Combo meals like the Mongolian beef with an eggroll, cream cheese wontons, and fried rice for one runs $10 with no drink. A bit pricey compared to something like Panda Express.
0	PBkFZFWzwDUgWiffmMiiCw	The service was good, the subs tasted just like the ones I ate in Jersey. Much better than subway. They slice all the meat and cheese when you order the sub, and you can definitely taste the fresh difference!
0	0NdHa6gs8l6y5F9IedEwXg	Overview: This Wendy's is nestled in Charlotte Airport's Concourse A, and is impossible to miss thanks to its location next to a gigantic photo of a woman eating Wendy's fries.  The Service: More tired and disgruntled than their non-airport counterparts due to very, very early hours.  The Establishment: There is a small collection of tables directly next to this Wendy's that can seat probably a dozen people. It's usually open and I have never had trouble finding a place to sit.  The Food: Everything here is prepared with more haste than its out-of-airport version, even when there is no line. Chili containers only 3/4 full, breakfast burritos (pictured below) look like tiny bean bags, etc. Also, the menu appears truncated and doesn't include value-items or specialty items like like Frosties (if my memory serves me correctly.) If need more detail on how it tastes, the breakfast burrito is mushy, and one-dimensional. The chili is overly salty, and all the meat appears to have been burned at one point. Chicken sandwiches are dry and also flavorless. Veggies are skimpy. Bread is... white.  Conclusions: This airport Wendy's is unfortunately a fairly mediocre fast food restaurant that I regrettably eat at often due to the lack of selection in Concourse A.
0	AbCyYP5SuwG9EvCWadjDaA	I was really looking forward to the opening and then was really disappointed even after giving it a couple tries.   The good thing is the beer list is one of the better ones in Arizona for the place (beer list at Papago is good but not my scene), that's the one good thing.   First try:  I got the kale salad with chicken. The kale was gritty (like it wasn't washed gritty) and not softened (I know its tough but usually you soften it for salad).  Felt like it was just taken out of the bag and put on a plate with some chicken out of the fridge (yah, chicken was cold). I mentioned something to the bartender who then tried to explain how kale worked to me and felt just really condescending/restaurant egoy (not a word but getting a point across). The good about  the food that day was the pretzel was good but that's hard to screw up.   The second time, went back for lunch.  Asked for a sporting event to be turned on and the bartender turned the channel, but then for her friends when the basketball game came on she turned it for them. Was a bit strange since she did it without asking.  Service was spotty and we had one drink and left.    I don't think I'll be returning, between the service and the so-so food, I wasn't as impressed as I really wanted to be.
0	xA37z8sRPi24tp41MjjQ	I been to five different Oregano's in the Valley and although I've had bizarre experiences at three of them, some of it was due to the company I was with and not the actual restaurant itself.  As a native northeasterner who appreciates traditional NY style Neopolitan pizza, I'm not a big thick crust/pan pizza guy. Oregano's pan pizza is different though.  Their smallest pie can fill up two people and unlike Pizza Hut (not that I actually eat there), the crust is never greasy and with topping choices like cajun chicken or sundried tomatoes, who can complain?   Their house salad is great with lettuce options more exotic than your standard iceberg and excellent dressings. Chicken wings are also very good with a mustard flavor that tastes a lot better than it sounds.   Most customers hate surprises. At Oregano's they avoid surprises by telling you the wait time for a table or that pan pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.  I was at the Mesa restaurant on a weekday and our pizza was taking forever. We began dozing off at the table when our server came to us and told us the cooks forgot about us and there will be no charge for the whole meal (including salad we ate earlier) and did we still want to eat the pizza here or take it to go?  It was after 11 pm on a Wed. Following that a manager came to us and told us how he felt when a restaurant when he's in a restaurant and things go wrong and how he reacts to the staff (keep in mind we never complained or even asked about when our pizza was coming). He gives his apologies and tells us a desert cookie will be made for us while our pizza is being finished. That was also going to be free.   After eating our pizza and sharing the only desert they serve (a large homemade cookie served in the pan it was cooked in with lumps of ice cream on top) we tried to leave a tip on our zero balance bill that the waitress didn't even seem interested in accepting.   Despite the wait, it was a pleasant experience that someone could realize something was wrong and do something about it without you having to tell them.   I've also eaten at the North Scotts location, Old Town, Camelback and University in Tempe. All are pretty standard in quality.  If I have some criticism it is that I like my pizza toppings on top of my pizza. At Oreganos they go under the cheese, which makes it hard to get crispy.   This sometimes prevents me from ordering meats like pepperoni or ground beef. That's okay though, because I like the vegetable options too.   Also, I've waited nearly an hour on multiple occasions at the Mesa location to get a pan pizza. Other locations are usually closer to their 35 minute estimation.
0	BW2sIZnJSRbiFcGpU7MYg	We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were impressed! The Kobe beef sushi appetizer was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a chain!  The cuisine was not "vanilla" and service was outstanding!
0	hPitavZTPXfCmSuQLonErA	As strange as it may be to find a good Mexican food restaurant inside a SwapMart... this place is good. Went here this past weekend... went a couple times actually. Had breakfast; a HUGE breakfast burrito with a homemade spicy and flavorful salsa that cost $5 and then for lunch I went for the flat fry bread with shredded chicken. Both meals were great and big enough to share. For breakfast and lunch my husband and I split the meals and only spend $12. For a inexpensive Sat or Sun of shopping and lunch it was a good day.
0	bUspdEQWnJOb1sekDjlhhA	Let me start by saying that Carefree Catering has 11 trucks around the valley so your experience may differ.  I believe these are the trucks that typically service the construction sites but have branched out because of the recent food truck craze. Also, when there were two Carefree Catering trucks parked within a block of each other outside my work (the courthouse), I noticed that the menu items and prices were different for each truck.  The trucks that come by my work are all white and don't have any distinguishing characteristics.  I know there is one that is painted but I've never eaten from it.  I have no idea how to distinguish the plain white ones.    I ordered a California burrito for $5.50 at one truck.  Maybe California burritos have been bastardized outside of San Diego, but, in San Diego (the home of the California burrito) a California burrito is carne asada, French fries, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.  This was ground beef, French fries, and a little bit of sour cream.  The ground beef did not taste good so I stopped eating it and I ended up getting sick later in the evening.    Later, I did notice that another Carefree Catering truck was selling California burritos for $5.  No idea if they differed in any respect from the other truck.  I wasn't willing to risk it again.  Basically, this truck chain is a crap shoot.  I have encountered some people who enjoy the food from their neighborhood Carefree Catering truck.  If you have a favorite Carefree Catering truck, stick with it.  But don't expect consistency between the trucks.
0	r5mwi46oTn1AGshnmCFIQ	I was excited when this place opened, the west side needed a cool hang out bar. Unfortunately out of the four times that I have been there, I have been disappointed.   The bartenders do not know how to make their special drinks, one bartender forgot to add the cranberry to the cosmo, which another bartender noticed and fixed. On other occasions a few of us ordered some of the other special drinks, such as the champagne drinks, again, less than desirable.  The one time we went to try their beer, since it had finally been brewed, we ended up walking out because the waitor straight up ignored us for 25 minutes and as we were walking out he caught up to us in the parking lot and started yelling for us to come back.  The food sounds impressive on the menu, but its not.  For the price I would rather drive over to the Great Dane in Hilldale/Fitchburg.  We will continue to frequent Babes for drinks instead of the Vintage.   The vintage has potential and I hope that they correct the various issues.
0	9qutRrEW4JnuI7KJRKtnvg	This location is convenient due to it not being so far off the Las Vegas Strip! The service and overall area is clean and surrounded by grocery stores so that you can pick up a few things before heading back to the strip. The customer service is great and I had no problem with my quick lunch here.
0	PzyFbuevjZ9TCQarCKWyeQ	MUCH better meal than the night earlier at the Venetian.  Like others we went here before the Zumanity show (eh, as far as I am concerned).  Got reservations the day of, had a lovely table and wonderful meal.  Wine & water were poured for us more than the night before as well. And a wine list with a Nice variety of styles & price ranges.  Probably only snafu was ordering a bottle of wine to have "with our food" come out as soon as we ordered it - a LOVELY Malbec.  No wow factors here, typical steakhouse fare, although I will say the sides have some extra seasonings which are nice.
0	q4ICGQDBlAjw1SReAuGbkw	It's Chipotle. It fulfills a need--satisfying my cravings for psuedo-Mexican food. I do actually think their guac is really good, and the unique char on the chicken is what keeps me coming back. Of course there are better choices for Mexican, but how can you deny that specific craving?
0	Yz3cmSTGgPD9dWYrQX7JQ	The customer service is great and the portions are generous, however the chili cheese fries were overcooked and chili was not very appetizing. I also ordered a Reuben sandwich that was mediocre. Lastly I know this is  Vegas, but $18 plus for both items seems steep. I don't mind paying a premium price for food when it's but this meal, did not meet the criteria.
0	zl50db0Hvf3zUV42QGh8ig	I'm still on my plight for the best pizza in Charlotte, and while I'm not ready to officially crown Hawthorne's as my pizza king, they still dole out some pretty sweet slices.   Hawthorne's is a fairly straight forward pizza join - there are two areas, one large dining room and one more "bar-ish" area with plenty of high top tables. Hubs and I usually grab a seat in the latter as there can be lots 'o kiddos running around in the main dining area (depending on the day, of course). The service is quick and friendly and they have a decent beer list to accompany their 'za.  If I'm super hungry I'll usually start off with the Garlic Cheese Bread - exactly what you would think: a hefty portion of toasted French bread, smothered in a multitude of cheeses and garlic and served with a very tasty marinara. Truth - sometimes I just prefer to make this my meal with a small side salad. But...if I'm ordering pizza, I'm a fan of their veggie as well as their white pizza. I do, however, feel the need to blot that sucker every time it comes out. But hey - that seems normal, right?  Thanks to Hawthorne's I can grab a tasty slice at lunch or hang out for a while and take down a multitude of cheesy goodness.
0	iIZUjpv5SJIpgxkmZObxA	No avocados! Bummer. Pulled up to the drive-thru and the chick wasn't very friendly. I asked for the Avocolada and instead of saying something like that, " I'm sorry, we are out of avocados, is there something else we can make you." I got an," We can't make that, we're out of avocados" in a not-so friendly tone. These younger ladies need to learn some manners.
0	O9nGlXuamRyk8IeCVj4Vg	I met "the best thing that's ever happened to me" (inside joke) here.  Luckily, our friends frequent this place often when it's a little warmer out.    We go for the beer and volleyball, but the boy and I are a bit of competitors at the ping pong tables.  It's always so much fun.  Even when we compete against teams of people that we don't know..(and we win!)  Our dog comes with us occasionally, and someone even brings a duck from time to time.  There is live music for most of the summer, but once it get's too hot, they stop coming out :(    You do not need to have your own volley ball, they will loan you once, as well as horshoes or bags, in exchange for your keys.  They have good pitcher specials, I think 6 or 7 dollars.  A few servers will make their way around the grounds and bring your beer out for you.  You can rinse the sand off of you before heading home.  Keep in mind this place closes at 11 and I personally think they have fun kicking people out.    They serve food here as well.  You can order off of the menu, or you can buy burgers to cook yourself.  They have all the fixing set up inside.  I have made my own burger once, and have had taco's once, but really, I don't go there for the food, so don't get too excited about that part.
0	x8GeM5ApC5F67DV6zhx1g	Ordered the Carne Asada plate! So much TASTE in the marinaded steak! about $7 and I ordered NO CHEESE due to my lactose intolerance and they were very curtious and took my request seriously. I will be going back to this hole in the wall and the lady behind the counter recommended that I get the Burrito and Taco combo next time!
0	vX8qNqvpyTc8CnPKrGxvKQ	great food here.  fresh taste to everything.  just slightly overpriced.  great smoothies.  the chicken Cesar wrap rocks.  i love to eat lunch here and grab a seat at the front window facing grant and people watch.  nice menu selection and their soups hit the spot on a cold day.
0	FVOjBuJ4q1tJEW3qn5ZjLg	Everytime my sister gets out of school she wants to go to Taco Bell and finally I gave in a took her. As we walked in you can see how nicely kept the building was and automatically got a great vibe from the employees. our cashier was funny and even cute (single ladiessssss :)).  The was not very hot but still warm enough to where it tasted good. The only thing i ever really complain about is that everytime I eat tacos I have a horrible after taste left in my mouth , next time I'll buy gum before I go!  Its a great place for on the go , just got off work or put of school type place. Can you say " quiero Taco Bell ?"
0	vLsKWi8kiUMTdT3L6SwHA	easy to miss gem in the venetian's restaurant row. part of the pinot family of restaurants with sister locations in southern california. excellent bar staff that offers the option of ordering from the menu of you don't want to bother with a full on convention networking dinner (yick). pan seared scallops is one of my favorites, as is the chicken & brie sandwich.
0	oGAl0qvKqHKAiIOrPboZQ	What is it with Arizona and their obsession with California chains?  It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.    The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.    I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.    The only thing "habit" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.    Hit up Lobby's a mile or so north for a big, juicy, flavorful burger  that is locally owned and blows away this less than stellar chain from CA.  The most disappointing thing is the landlord kicked out TOTTs for a run of the mill burger chain.
0	5L8LaECdniAstrDiKOonPw	Good service and good food. The only thing I find odd about this fast food restaurant is they make you sign the receipt when using a debit card?!?! The receipt even says no signature required. By the way they don't check your ID to match the debit/credit card but make you sign the receipt. This is obviously a clueless manager or owner who thinks signing a "no signature required receipt" protects them some way...while not checking ID with the use of credit/debit cards is not protecting them or their customers. Get with the times Arbys on Flamingo.
0	aSDqcBK1OwvC45HVrcYZVQ	I went to IHOP on 3/26/2013 at 12:28am. I went with my wife and mother to satisfy one of my pregnant wife's cravings.   Since it was so late both my mother and I did not want to get hug meals so we inquired about ordering off of the kids menu which we were told was quite alright. The server seemed nice he wasn't great but I give it to having to work a late shift.   My wife ordered the Pancake combo with over hard eggs hash browns sausage and the pancakes where NY cheese cake pancakes. My mother ordered the grilled Mac and Cheese. I ordered the Mac and cheese and then my wife gave me the IF YOU DONT ORDER SOMETHING ELSE I WILL STAB YOU LOOK simply because she did not want to be the only one seeming like she was eating at the table so I also ordered a crispy chicken salad.  The pancakes did not have a single hint of cheesecake but they were still good maybe its because I really like ihop pancakes but I thought they were still delicious, my wife on the other hand wasn't so pleased as she didn't feel her prego sweet tooth was satisfied. The hash browns sausage and eggs were the usual nothing out of the ordinary. The grilled cheese sandwich was exactly like the grilled cheese I would make at home toasted brad with a slice of cheese is in the middle. The Mac and cheese was regular Kraft Mac and cheese. The salad just happens to be one of my favorite salads at ihop and it surely never disappoints its filling and tasteful.  We asked for the tab and when I received it I was shocked to see that even after ordering off of the kids menu the entire bill was still over $30.00 O.O!!! Luckily we had a menu at the table and my mom quickly started comparing the prices. She immediately noticed that we were charged the incorrect amounts. My wife suggested that maybe the pricing was different given the hour. I looked through out the menu and the check to see any sort of fine print that may state that prices are subject to change based on time but there was none. I asked the server if the prices where different given the time it was he explained that they were not. I showed the server the inconstancies in my check and the pricing that was listed in the menu. He said WOW! I'm shocked I've never had someone point that out. He then picked up the tab and my credit card which was laying on the table and said let me see why it did that. My thoughts were oh well he's surely going to edit the amounts and bring me the correct bill and charge that to me. Well to my surprise he did absolutely nothing and simply charged me the incorrect amount.   I have a very short temper especially when I feel someone is trying to take me for a fool but in this particular instance I held my cool and simply walked out of the establishment before I turned ihop into a crime seen over 2 measly dollars. My wife later asked my why I was so aggravated at the situation and I had to explain that if ihop is doing this to every single person because no one is checking their bills then they are committing fraud and false advertising. I explained that if I was committing fraud I'd be in jail so why is it ok for them to do it? And at the end of the day its not about the 2 dollars its about the principal!!   I ended up writing a contact us form about the issue I doubt they'll actually reply.

We have yet to ever leave with our entire order 100% correct. They constantly give us the wrong food and usually leave out one or MORE things we ordered.   Staff is unpleasant and the managers don't care if you say anything. They're equally unpleasant. Would not recommend this place! I ONLY gave them two stars because the inside is clean and that's important to me.
0	7YiIrR2LpfA1v8wed19A	Its a cool, laid back cheers like bar with 6 tv screens for sports or of anything of interest ( but no volume unless its the Superboowl) . The service is good as well as the food, drinks are made right & very reasonable in price. The bartenders are people persons and very attentive. They have a jukebox for good music.  A good place to relax or to meet up with friends to have a couple of beverages. Just wish they had better smoke ventilaters within the bar.
0	yPWUTUpEg37QbBVmZYqpg	I like the decor... was definitely impressed by the amount of TVs.  My boyfriend and I sat at a high top to watch the ASU game.  The place was a  little empty but it was still pretty early in the day.  I'm curious to see how it acts as a club.  Salads were overpriced, but who honestly orders a salad at a bar?  You shouldn't.  But we did anyway.  I didn't realize that bacon on a salad meant bac-o's, Firehouse... but thank you for educating me.  Had a vodka soda.  It wasn't great.  Our waitress was super sweet though & really attentive.    Next time, I'll try this place when I'm in the mood for wings & beer.
0	xDLvTeQOuxIwdg1UOJZA	We got pretty bad service. We spent a total of two hours there and were only eating for 15 minutes, tops. The margarita was gross. The food was pretty standard Americanized Mexican food. I'm not really sure why this place has such good reviews. I'd try again, but this was my second go at it. Meh. Just, meh.
0	Bh8EJgaPtoy9XBjxtdbK8Q	Love jimmy johns by not this one. I live right around the corner so I keep going here hoping it to be as good as the rest but it's not. Staff has a lackluster attitude and sandwiches are always sub par. Bread seems to be not as fresh and they are VERY frugal with the meat. I normal get a number 5 and there were three pieces of sliced salami on it today. I think I'll finally throw in the towel for this location.
0	PXiKup6mL5wkpUDCh7Fw	i was very happy to know that a smoked meat restaurant was opening near by waterloo. I got the 3 meat dinner as I wanted to try most of the meats. The meats were good but the sauce were a little too sweet and not smokey enough. It also made me feel a little sick to the stomach. There beans are good but again, the sauce made me feel a little sick. Would avoid this place and rather go to hog tails which has real authentic smoked meat and sauces.
0	pH4X2f0RRsBxTZIVwiwrBQ	When we are too tired to cook, and want a guaranteed yummy pizza, this is the place to go. OR when we meet  up with other friends that  have  kids under five, we meet up here.   Favorite pizzas are the combo or  all meat pizza. They have all  the standard toppings and their crust is semi-thick. For those from the SF Bay Area, this place reminds me of Round Table.  The kids spaghetti and meatballs is so  yummy, and  the prices are right.  There's a place for little kids to play in the dining  room.  I think it must be an annoying place to eat if you do not have kids.  One  time, a man  yelled at me because all the loud kids in the place were annoying him -  I thought it was funny because I was only responsible for one of the ten running around. Bottom line, this place caters to families  -  so if you are a kid-less couple looking for a quiet romantic pizza dinner, order take out!
0	nfEGEjpVEX4DxHhmvWlQ	A great place to take the kids that will not break you.  With all of the kids and parties going on, the place is always clean and the food comes out pretty fast.  It is not the greatest pizza, but the kids love it and they love you even more for taking them to PPP!
0	fMqaqCur1Zv5WV7RLGDWA	I'm a little more biased towards Jin Mee because of knowing the people, but that usually isn't enough to get me coming back to a place if I don't like it.  The restaurant is really big now.  Now you can cook kalbi or other meats right on your table.  The service is good.  I'm not really a jjajjangmyun fan (black bean noodles) so I don't really order this, but I do like their jjampong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) and bi bbim neng myun (spicy noodles).  The atmosphere is nice, and they also have a Karaoke place next door now.
0	62oGINZJqC14nr1rJdS6eg	My wife and I met a couple of friends there this evening and had a disappointing experience. We are all big fans of Indian food who eat at Indian restaurants, locally and internationally, on a regular basis.  The service at Spice South was pretty poor. Papadums weren't complimentary like all the other local Indian restaurants, so we ordered some but were given no chutney. When we asked for chutney or something like it, we were told "we don't have chutney". I ordered a lamb dish which, although it was edible and spiced perfectly, was very chewy. I felt quite lucky as another person at our table didn't receive their food at all. We had to track down our apologetic waiter to ask about her order.  Her food eventually showed up, but not until after the rest of us had pretty much finished our meals.  Although they carry a fairly good selection of Indian beers, when we ordered we were informed they were warm and wouldn't serve them to us. I don't think we'll be going back there too soon and I'm giving it a generous two because the flavours were satisfactory.
0	yiKZsM0ZfUem0o8xfxGg	Well, I do begrudge the price of most things these days but I have to draw attention to my experience today. I thought I'd treat myself to a baked potato and a can of juice both of which came to \u00a33.40 which seems not too bad but it was when you consider the potato was closer to the size of a Jersey royal. The 'cheddar' was the cheapest nastiest radioactive orange sludge I've seen in a while and believe me, I'm no stranger to greasy spoons or Farmfoods. Perhaps I should have said something at the time but it annoys me when owners turn up in their fancy cars whilst staff get paid not that much and I pay \u00a32.70 for something that probably cost 20p to make. I'm not wanting to start a revolution over a baked tattie but I think I'll remember to take my own lunch into work from now on.
0	T60N0xx7qKd7aJKDLGq3w	Very friendly staff. Cute lil nook of a place, clean and nice. The food was just ok. One guest order eggs over hard, and both dishes came out over easy, even as the server asked, who had over hard. Hash browns and toast not browned or warm enough. No omelette options on the menu at all. Went because of the reviews on the biscuits/gravy, but didn't have today, and not a regular menu item. Suggestion to add them. Coffee refills slow and when it came time to pay, put the credit card away after awhile and paid cash so we could leave.  Think there is potential here, but need to improve in some areas.
0	MKC6vioPvMvyakFx3IjiUQ	At these price points I expected a Ruth's Chris or similar steak house. I had great service, but my steak just didn't seem to be at the quality it should be to justify the price. If you truly want a high end steak house then keep looking.
0	5v7IZxpguA5Yih9z8FXyNA	Paid for Lunch is a perk that we have at work and we all decide on a place to eat for that day and we order. Well we have placed an order a few times with Sofias Pizza, The first time we ordered it was okay, but we decided to try it again...They take your order and get it to relatively fast but the quality of the food is not there. The pizza was border line the first time and we tried it again and it was a Grease Bucket... You know that your pizza is a little too Greasy when you eat it and all you can taste after is Grease.
0	RGlWtB0DD0NEMwn5y74T3w	Well I have been waiting for Dillon's to open at the Top of Central. There have been several starts and stops there. I got there a few minutes past "happy hour" ...gosh darn it, but oh well I definitley had a hankering for BBQ. I asked them to bring me a Blue Moon, waitress apologized for not having a Blue Moon. How about a Stella? Absolutely, only to come back minutes later, "oh, we are out of Stella". I'll take water and the 2 meat platter with French Fries (don't let my wife know) and mac and cheese even though I wanted some cole slaw as well.   Meal arrived and my first impression, what a skimpy portion of mac and cheese but there were a lot of hand cut fries. Fries were served with a hummingbird serving of catsup, asked the waiter, bring me more and he complied. Had the Beef Brisket and St Luis style ribs with Cajun sauce.   Beef, dried out and very little sauce and none on the table. I was afraid to ask for more. Ribs were dried out as well with a bit of tangy sauce that I thought was pretty good. All told, I walked spending just under $20 dollars, no beer, not much sauce and pretty disappointed. Sorry, not going to be my Cue place even though it's in the neighborhood.   I want a cue place with great smoked meats, great sauces and value friendly. Not Dillons on Central.
0	vM9nUcrkE6EiQhXzotWLJw	I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again.    On a Friday night, a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up.  If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival.  Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say "No, we're just here for a beer or two."  Soon after, we were seated and placed an order for 3 pints.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers.  During that time, we noticed lots of servers standing around one POS (point of sale).  It looked as if servers were waiting in line to put in their individual orders.  Our suspicion was confirmed later that evening, only one working POS.  I wonder why they didn't have a backup plan-paper tickets?  I would think people would be more inclined to walk out on their tab because of the excruciating wait than management have to worry about losing money with paper tickets.  Our waters were refilled twice before our first round of beers arrived at our table.  Two of my buddies call this place the "Water House" because that's all they got when they visited Angel's Trumpet Ale House.    Once we received our beers, we asked her to place another order for another round of beers because we figured that we would receive our 2nd set of beers just as we finished our first ones.  It worked!  If ya plan on having another beer, be sure to place an order as soon as the first beers arrive so that you don't hafta wait long for your second beer.    I think the night was best portrayed by a sneak peek that I got of the owner- he was rubbing his temples and obviously under stress.   I am inclined to give them a star or two more once the timing has improved.    Great building, good ambiance, wonderful patio (hope it's pet friendly), excellent location and a good selection of beers.    Oh, I like the idea of three bathroom choices instead of the typical two.
0	BZRdHVn3lM4sPBKteN3ddg	The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...
0	804GkT3B5HGycGVKEUGAw	3am, and a night filled with way too many drinks, way too many bets, and great times with friends and family.  Where to get a greasy fix?  Fatburger.    This one is located within the Red Rock Casino Resort, and is open to fill your needs 24/7.  The Big Fat Deal with Cheese and Fried Egg was heavenly, especially considering the state of mind I was in.  Nice!
0	ftmWedXgx9XH6gjgyHSj2g	I'm so fond of Hubbard Avenue Diner in spite of eating there exclusively with my ex-fiance, who turned out to be a complete tool.  The point is, that's how good this place is.  I can vouch for the breakfasts (spinach omelet as well as whole grain blueberry pancakes) as well as the lunch/dinner menu and pie.  I had their tuna steak sandwich once, and it was good but not great.  My standby is the veggie burger, which is just right.  There always seems to be a wait, but it's been worth it for this FIB.
0	7awVnK3E4h9vU6woeaz4g	Decided to give this place a try after finding it on Restaurant.com.  I'd have to say that I should have ordered something else, but I didn't.  I had the rad Na with seafood, and I wasn't overly impressed.  The Rad Na came with a lot of seafood: shrimp, squid, fish balls, mussels, and imitation crab.  The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce that was spicy.  It wasn't all that bad if you don't know Thai food.. almost like a spicy Chinese dish.  However, Rad Na is supposed to have a dark gravy sauce on it, and this just didn't cut it.    I did have the Thai tea, which was good.  The service was absurdly good.  The cute little Thai waitress was full of smiles and helpful suggestions (although it was a little hard to understand her).  I will have to try some of their other dishes some time and update my review if I find other dishes that are better, but for now I can't recommend this spot.  Sorry, Thai Pepper waitress!
0	8kgo52iFx2BEAagNvbKfw	We ordered kids meal, jr whopper, whopper & chicken club. We had to park? K? Food was fresh but I know what they were doing, they are trying to trick the timer and speed of service. We were the ONLY car. Annoying.
0	qaLg1p3YeTK6WUW9anGSg	This is a great bar. I like to come here and unwind with girlfriends. Food is good, although not spectacular--just your usual bar fare done right. Bartenders are attentive and definitely earn their keep. I love the little modern touches to the otherwise older-Vegas feel--like the large swivel computer screen where a plethora of fun games can be played--I especially liked the puzzle games with semi-naked women--a good touch to a drunk night! I'll be back again.
0	hNsl15VvTLtnvJ2K1gRJDQ	Ate lunch here today while visiting my cousin Marc.  His wife Lori is a huge fan of this place.  She kept saying "fresh" over & over again.  She was right.  It's a big room in a huge outdoor/strip mall kind of place.  You order off a menu that is painted on the wall, then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you.  You order shrimp tacos, they throw the shrimp on the open stove right there.  Then they take your plate down the counter of "fresh" ingredients and ask you want you want.   What kind of rice do you want? What kind of beans? Which salsa? Which reminds me: they have mango salsa!  Are you kidding me?  It was yummy. Did I mention they serve mexican beers?  They have margaritas too.  But they're pre-made and come out of a tap.  Which is the reason I'm not giving Bajio 5 stars The place was seriously busy at lunch, but they have many tables.
0	DwCVWDqY8nZos3g7D8Ypw	After leaving the Iowa cafe we came over to the cozy corner cafe.  We were seated immediately and our drink orders taken.  We both ordered omelets which were served promptly.   Highly recommend this restaurant!
0	JraPPIX5CxnsyWzdBZLtkg	Had lunch here on a weekend when we didn't want to wait for a table at Morning Glory.  This is definitely "slow" food so be warned.  Luckily the outdoor seating was beautiful but a bread basket definitely would've helped calm our rumbling stomachs.  Farm burger ($14) was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley - flavorful beef patty with a moist tender interior.  Braised short rib sandwich was a bit bland by comparison.  Locally grown garden veg crudite ($14) was fresh and full of crunchy healthy goodness.
0	H8oOAFpoWxZx2ty284cJw	For years this building has been a place for burnouts and drug addicts to congregate around. Many of you may know it as the old art store that had the big xylophone in front. When I saw that someone was finally developing this space I was excited, well that is until I ate there. The Good: Well lit and clean place with very cheap eats and large portions The Bad: The chicken is... not... good. With a name like Bad Mother Cluckers I HAD to try it. When I went to eat there with co-workers I ordered the sliders that were on special. Fearing that they would be insufficient for my ravenous hunger I ordered 2. As it turns out the slider special is a huge amount of food. For 2 orders of the slider special, fries and a can of soda I was in less than $6. The problem was that the chicken sliders were just as my rating implies "meh". Sadly KFC is 100% better. I normally don't complain about this but the amount of time it took to order, prepare and finally get our meal was long to say the least. Our lunch break was over by the time we all got our food. The place was nearly empty and there are only a handful of items on the menu so there really was no excuse. On a completely unrelated note while we were eating 2 very attractive Asian women walked in and started eating on the other side of the room. My co-worker pulled the "hey I dropped my fork" move so he had a reason to say hi to them. They were so far away though that he literally had to throw his fork. This was literally the best part about eating there. "A" for effort on his part.
0	zc7ozFsMaVvuamfgtcqw	Good stuff, the Fat Tire is so divine.  These guys use mixed gas on Fat Tire which is the only way to have it.  The Ruben is great, also the chili is good.  The price is also good, $7 for the soup and 1/2 sand which deal.  I would give this place 5 stars but the staff is not cool, they could learn some lessons on customer service.  They wouldn't fix my girlfriend's order after they screwed it up so now I can't get her to go back.
0	1mmjgczSAJiwcgSapUQHZQ	I went the same night Rick H went and had the exact same experience, I think we must have had the same waitress. When we asked what imports she had on tap she listed Bud, Coors, Miller.....LOL She was super sweet and very new so Im sure she will be grerat in a couple weeks. This was our second time in,  We went opening week ( I know my bad) for our first time and waited and hour and a half for the food so tonight's dinner was comped to try to woo us back in.  Nothing stand out here just your Typical Sonora Mexican food nothing special, nothing terrible.  I think the bar will do well and since the closest competition is maccayo's I'm sure this place will do great.  Sorry to say I haven't discovered my favorite new Mexican food place in POPO"s, shame because it''s 5 mins from home.
0	Uou58QeaJdfcfdNkDlOig	It was not very good. Not terrible though. The pho and the tom yum both lacked hugely in flavour. Very very bland. The beef in the pho was awful, tasted like processed meat. The spring roll and imperial roll were average. The peanut sauce was so strange, it tasted watered down. The service was fantastic, however and the staff all really friendly. They do take debit now to whomever wrote that they didn't. The place was clean and they offer a large menu. I would maybe go back but perhaps try ordering something different.
0	GuWZhaqlCc4ZOaOUA7OnRg	Hotdog would be a 4 [once they got the order right], but since that took sometime for that we will give it a 2 Chili cheese fries, it it was melted cheese would've been a 5, but it's like shredded cheese that wasn't melted enough--3 Ordering-1  So after a morning of watching football and gambling on a Sunday we wanted drunk food.  So we decided on this place over McDonalds b/c I had seen in it on the news.  Walking in, it's way too bright, there's just stuff everywhere and it's just too much [see the pix it hurts your eyes and I love the American Flag but this is not tastefully done] After waiting about 5 mins b/c they had issues w/ the lady ordering in front of me it was finally my turn to experience the debacle [she even looked over at me rolled her eyes and wished me good luck].  Have you ever heard the expression "too many cooks in the kitchen", that's what happens here. There were 5 people behind the counter all bumping into each other, talking over each other, and not getting the job done.  They need more training. Plain and simple.  I had to order my order w/ the cash register guy 4 times before he repeated it, then the guy making the hotdogs still got it wrong. So, I had to look over the counter, coax him in the right direction, and get my dog right!!!!   My suggestion here: make a condiment bar.  That way people can put what they want on it, you don't have to do it behind the counter, nor worry about it, and the process would go much smoother.  They also don't have sauerkraut :(  that made me sad. I love a good kraut dog.  Chili was actually very good and the dog was great, crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The other issue:  they put shredded cheese on the chili cheese fries and it doesn't melt enough when you are trying to eat it. So cheese strings fall all over the place.  Also, there's not ketchup on the tables????  So I had to go back up ask for extra ketchup and they squeezed it into the top of my hotdog container, my guess is b/c they were running out of bottles of ketchup???  They didn't even have containers to put the ketchup in [again condiment bar....like Roberto's Tacos does would be awesome].  So place needs work, hopefully they make it happen.  2 hotdogs and a order of chili cheese fries just shy of $13
0	rj7CHsO6oT4Z00griVnX8A	Like the bar.  Did not experience the restaurant food or the music in the bar.  Staff is friendly and efficient.    I did try the creme brulee...coconut creme brulee.  It was very good.  I had an extensive conversation with the chef regarding sushi -- he was previously a sushi chef.  If you go to the Clarendon's website, there are some great restaurant referrals in Phoenix.
0	WBnfiM4Cc71pC5tvau4mCw	If you care about sanitation do not eat here.  You can see employees walking around while eating WHILE making your food.  I know a pizza goes through the oven but no workers wear gloves.  The floor is always a mess.  No hot-n-ready cheese pizza ever ready.  Always a wait of 15 minute for that and wayyy longer if custom order.    Dirty place.  Long wait.  Don't know how they are still open.   Not a 1 star because workers are friendly atleast.
0	ufk7Kc1oiqSOEGoIPiAew	You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!
0	472ZSJ6tPvyE9Jj7ZAB0mw	My wife is a vegetarian, and I am not. We can always agree on Carly's everything we have tried has been good. The service is always very nice, and they let us go at whatever speed we want, whether it is a quick lunch or a nice leisurely dinner.
0	kkA94f68Pjriec5sp9Q	I'm not a fan at all.  The place was clean, but that's all it had going for it.  The food was bad and overpriced.  The service was slow too.  It looks bad given it's in a mall area, but a few people around here recommended it.  Don't go here if you like good food.
0	wi248VXxK2OPxQNBhQNfA	On business in Vegas, I had a craving for sushi and Nigori sake. I walked myself over to the Forum Shops at Caesars to find this nice sushi place and plopped down at the sushi bar. Its a good place to eat alone, you never know the interesting people you may meet. I sat next to the former Prez of Sony Mexico - he was a nice gentleman and we had a pleasant conversation. I wanted ahi-poki but they didnt have the seaweed. The fish was fresh. The sushi chef was kind  and friendly but didn't put any love into his spicey salmon hand-roll (something I look for because it makes the sushi taste that much better!) The service was not up to par, maybe just that evening but I had to ask for chop sticks twice and wait quite awhile for my sake.  I would definitely recommend this place as an alternative to some of the more pricey japanese restaurants on the strip.
0	INsxNfolPhin4IkcxBlXeA	Was very disappointed with this location. Have been to several others of theirs and this one does not compare. Server was very nice but food was very below par. We ordered the wings but they were very small and bland. Sandwich was extremely small and dry. Tried to order dessert but they were out of bananas.
0	9OeUbOd6CtT61P4U5MxwQ	After shopping at Ross, we decided to stop by China One to order three items to go fpr dinner. We ordered chicken fried rice, seafood chow mein and salt and pepper chickens. They are pretty generous with their condiments but not the food. The salt and pepper chickens was crispy but tasted old. The chicken tasted like it has been marinated for more than a couple of days before it was brought out to fry.The seafood chow mein tasty but greasy. The chicken fired rice was on the crunchy side as though the rice didn't cook well.   The restaurant smells and looks good on the outside, however we will not be visiting this place again.
0	1aG3H65exxVMvzjBmA4g	This place is A-ok. If there isnt any other hawaiian place near you and you see L&L it will do. I'm not that big of a fan with their meats it seems like it isnt fresh .. i normally order the mix plate and the chicken katsu.. It's not all that great. The katsu sauce was a bit watery and I asked the girl if this was Katsu sauce?  she said yes and had to look at it twice. I told her katsu sauce isnt suppose to be watery at all she even agreed.  I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone I would only eat here if i had no choice.
0	xFe6tWtSI0ImlbYZsprjA	Me and my roommate have been to this applebees a few times but this last time was pretty bad,  We ordered the green bean chrispers, chicken tenders plate and  the oriental half salad.  Green bean chrispers were very over cooked as well as the chicken tenders to were i couldn't really eat them. the waitress was nice at first and then randomly she walks by sets the check on the table like i had made her mad and walked off with  out a word. Made me feel like a "get the hell out" from here. We WERE going to order desert but after that we decided against it. Bad service over cooked food.
0	NRz8WRrv1ghA6j4LHUytlw	A group of 4 of us visited Upper Crust last night for the 2nd time and were very disappointed compared to our first visit about 6 weeks ago.  We loved their antipasto platter the first time around - it was almost a meal in itself with good quality cheese and meats- for $11.99.  This time it was half the size and mostly roasted red peppers out of a jar.  The pizza crust was good, but we order sausage and sundried tomatoes and there was hardly any sausage on it and the tomatoes were quite dry.  Last time, they brought a pizza like this to our table by mistake and it looked so good we knew we would have to try it next.  The white pizza is still quite good.  The service in the bar area was better than last time.  We all agreed that we would not be going back.  There is better in the Valley.
0	IAEOXUpOB1R08DQMAexe4g	Lux put the bar in coffee bar. It's not a study spot (as alluded to in other reviews), it's usually packed, you order your drink at the counter, the baristas are unique, beautiful, personable, but busy. I like Lux a lot. But typically if I want to talk to someone I have to sit outside to do so. Coffee is pretty good. Although, I did have one bad round where I'm fairly certain the soy milk was a little rank...but other than that...real roasted coffee beans and delish muffins...all worth the trip.
0	h4etApRTg7ERplLy94SHw	I found a promotion on their website for a $20 prix fixe weekday lunch (normally it is $25...still a good deal), so while I was on xmas vacation, I took my parents here. It's location was a bit off putting, being in a strip mall and all, but once you go inside, you find it is very pleasant inside. The service was good, although the waiter seemed a bit young (maybe im getting old). Maybe seeing a young kid act as stodgy as he could was sort of amusing. As always, my parents took forever to choose what they wanted, and the servers were patient. We decided to order as many different things as possible. This is what I had  Appetizer: Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag Blue Cheese Coleslaw.  Entree:  Grilled Wild King Salmon on a Granny Smith Cabbage Slaw with Candied Walnuts...  Dessert: Coconut Bread Pudding with Coconut Sorbet and Dark Chocolate Sauce  The appetizer I had read about on ahem...Chowhound to overwhelming accolades, but i found it to be overrated. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and the blue cheese a bit gimmicky. Tasty but unspectacular. The entree was substantial and robust, tho I actually enjoyed my moms choice best, which was the Pan Seared Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It was very succulent. By dessert, we were already stuffed but they stood out as the highlight. The Chocolate Flourless Cake was a surprise favorite. The Rustic Apple Tart would have been better served warm. The Coconut Bread Pudding was very sweet and very good.   I had successfully won over my buffet-obsessed and skeptical parents, and they ended up crowing all last week to their friends about the place. Great value for very good food.

0	Zd5mZI0o4SBblNYYLw2q4w	I had excellent service here. I ordered the "asian slaw" slider (with boca burger... not my favorite veggie burger thing but it went well with the wasabi aioli they put on it. I also had the southwest chipotle salad which was excellent, and a Fever Tree ginger ale, which was pretty cool to find in somewhere other than a beverage store. My wife's lunch came with sweet potato fries and they were awesome! I've always liked these and have been disappointed by ones that I've found recently. These were top notch.   Overall, I was really pleased. For lunch for two, a Rogue Amber beer and the ginger ale, the bill was about $22. Very reasonable.

My local friend said the breakfast they serve is oversized if you want.  Some oversized people up in here too.  I got a kick out of the large bear carvings inside and out.  The waitresses also make fresh o.j. with the machines sitting right in the dining area.  What a trip.
0	yZGpsgESbSF8eG3s75RgA	Ever been in a relationship where it ended, but you wanted it to work out so badly that you gave it another shot.    yea.....this place definitely made me want to come back because i thought it had some serious potential but after the second visit it made me realize that it was:  1. Over-priced 2. Soup was bland and Luke-warm 3. Portions were small  o yea don't order the pork belly either if you're expecting anything close to grilled deliciousness because its everything BUT that.  Sorry 28go, I guess it just wasn't meant to be
0	2osp0HewAtm1cw77uzMegA	This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isn't done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late.
0	R1OzN0lCsbr7RCsBaDNoA	I am an out-of-towner, just in Madison for a wedding so we did State Street bar hopping to get the feel for the school and the city.    Paul's was full of college kids and was a little too packed for my old-lady likings when we first got there. With patience though, seats opened up quickly and we had an entire couch area to ourselves.  Drinks were reasonably priced (I'm from Seattle so everything in Madison was practically free in my opinion) and the decor was really cool.  The tree is awesome.    I would go here again, if we weren't so drunk the night of the wedding I'm sure we would have returned..hahaha!!
0	Z4M2TkJJ6VgieGwqjGZLqw	This place almost single handedly rescues Phoenix from dinning-mediocrity.  It is by all means a ma-pa shop tucked away in a not so developed area of east-Phoenix.  If you are going south on 16th Street, it will be on your right hand side after Thomas Rd.  It's across the street from a strip mall and honestly there's not much else around.    Their small parking lot is in back of the restaurant.  But inside, fantastic Mexican food and a cornucopia of Tequilas await you.  Guacamole is made fresh table-side.  Tell them to go easy on the dried cranberries or raisins.  The menu has a long list of authentic Mexican dishes.  The mole sauce is very good but definitely try the fish tacos.   Prices are reasonable, be prepared to spend around $20-25 for dinner.  All in all, Barrio is a great experience.
0	5afv0wMTWIv5KJAdgiP4IQ	we ordered from here again tonight ... no it is not a fluke! it seems every time we order from here, something has gone wrong with our pizza... I took pics of the pizza we ordered, if I can I will put them on here...it was really overcooked!!!
0	bku8jbQx4eufdAQmG7w	I can't speak for the lobster entrees since they were sold out, but the lobster bisque is over salted, fishy and over priced. $9 for a cup (8 oz) of mediocre soup. The fried haddock was served on a doughy 10 cent bun slathered in mayo. Not worth $12.
0	eu4ntgYN9XFo8of8lNg5A	What can you really say about top of the line restaurants in Vegas?  I mean it's so hard to go wrong when you're paying a check for $8500 (granted it was a large group ^_^).  However a restaurant really has to screw up to get below a three star rating.  We had a pre-fix menu that allowed us various options.  The Tomato & Mozzarella  appetizer was extremely tasty.  The texture was firm and was almost like eating a hearty steak.  You can never go wrong w/ the balsamic vinegar drizzled every so lightly over it w/ a crack of black pepper.  The rib eye was a fairly generous cut and was cooked to my liking.  It was nicely charred on the outside w/ a nice crisp, and despite saying that all the meat that night would be cooked 'medium', they did make mine medium rare.  It was nicely seasoned and aged well.  It was almost as good as Delmonico's . . . almost.  Overall the service was excellent and the atmosphere very quaint.  You get a great view of the golf course and depending on where you're seating you can overlook a waterfall as well.  The restaurant also has a pro-golf shop in front, however i"m sure their prices are outrageous.  A great experience, however I do think their drinks weren't worth the price.  If you're gonna pay $15 for a martini, it better give you a rush that you've never felt before.
0	X2UykU8JRn78A06arO3Cg	This place has great sushi and fun creative rolls. I personally like the Japanese Lasagna, Screaming O, and the Tempura roll. The service is above par but they get packed pretty quickly at lunch, so we do alot of takeout since I work close by. I haven't tried any of the teppan dishes, but they also have teppan tables as well.
0	arasv7wIWimrMjFJC6hSw	Burgers. Beer. I love them both. And who knew you could get them both under one roof?? Wow! What a concept! Wonder if it will catch on? Here it is right at Benjamins. A welcome addition to Western Avenue to be sure. I like this place. I do. But, alas, I wanted to LOVE it. I don't. Oh sure, the atmosphere is totally charming - brick wall, roaring fire, great bar, friendly bartenders and service staff, a really nice place to sit and think "I'm gonna have some fun here!" Yep, the burgers are good. Quite good. With a good selection of interesting options. I had the green chilies, salsa, and chipotle mayo version and my wife had the rosemary, balsamic goat cheese and green apple one. Both were very tasty. We both had the slaw as a side and it was fresh and nicely chopped and not bathing in mayonnaise. (I hate that kind!) This was red wine vinegar based - almost too much vinegar though. Tasty for a few bites but I don't think you could eat the entire side without puckering. I couldn't. We started with the "mini pretzels and truffle mustard" - I mean, how could you NOT order that? I'll warn you - these are not real pretzels - these are vending machine pretzels, the little hard kind that come in a snack bag. What a disappointment! YUCK!  Although the burgers were good, my disappointment comes from the that fact that when you charge me $10-$12 for a 6 ounce burger, I'm not happy. Small indeed. I was still hungry. I can understand if you were giving me a nice 8 oz burger, but 6? Nah, no thanks. And, oh horror of horrors, there is NO DRAFT BEER! DId I misread the sign? It does say "Bar" doesn't it? WIthout it, I'm just left feeling unsatisfied. And so it was on my visit. I had to go next door to Modern Cafe to have my draft. I know it's a new place and maybe they're still figuring it out. Here's my advice - BIGGER burgers, DRAFT beer. Then I'll be back. Regularly! There are too many other delightful burger options out there to have to settle.
0	ZsVZ8GxiCGSnSB2b3dqdg	Nothing special. McMullans is better. The food is alright. Great service and friendly bartenders. Only bar with High Sierra beer from Reno. Its English? Maybe Irish? I'm confused. Cheap beer before a Hardrock concert only real reason to go outside of friendly bartenders
0	QLg0QjOhZQtC7ZfhXDBLTA	Food was amazing and it's a good thing b/c the hostesses kind of sucked.  Our 45 minute wait took almost 2 hours and the snotty high schoolers working the hostess stand almost caught a piece of my mind.  But thankfully the food and service made up for it.  I'd say go earlier or later to avoid some of the rush, especially as the bar area gets jam packed.
0	zRbSZBsBlgQR2PAT7AyQ	they have reallyreally good umeshu.  i have no idea how much it was but it was so rich and sweet and mmmm.  good cooked plates, pretty good sushi chefs.  id definitely recommend sitting at the bar.  they also have very good teppenyaki.  they serve kobe beef teppanyaki.  awesome.  i like the atmosphere.  but not the beeest japanese ive had.
0	qAqpGRHMgCWUQxFWZWA1w	I went to this restaurant for lunch with my girlfriend. It took a good 15 minutes to make one gyro plate and one Caesar salad.The lettuce for both meals was going bad and pink on the edges. The chicken in the Caesar salad and that gyro meat itself and the hummus were good. The Gyro plate did not come with a pita. This meal cost $23 with tax. A total rip off. I will not be coming back.
0	g00xxV1Db4EscBosCX7Giw	I wish I could give this place more than 2 stars since I see some great reviews. I ordered the "Buffalo Wings" and was stoked to hear that you get 10 per order all for $6.50! Let me just say that if you are looking for great wings, this is not the place. If you are looking for "Buffalo Wings" this is definitely not the place! I am from Buffalo so I was expecting some really crispy, hot, saucy wings. What I got were some subpar, breaded wings akin to what you might find on a Chinese buffet which are definitely NOT Buffalo Wings in any capacity. Despite getting something other than Buffalo Wings, I decided to give them a try. They were really grizzly and had this nasty freezer burnt taste. Needless to say I gave them to the cat.   I also ordered a slice of pepperoni to go. It was humongous! Sadly, the size was about all it had going for it. Maybe it would've been better if I ate it at the restaurant but it was just OK. Plus I came a little bit later in the day and I'm not sure how long that pizza had been sitting out. I've had better for sure.   My main critique is the wings. Horrible. Do not get them. The pizza- jury is out on that. I would try it again however I would dine in and come back during a busier time when the pizza might be fresher.
0	0PIuaakqzdMCjgthLrSpA	So I went to this new location located off of Hayden in North Scottsdale.  They have had signs up for a while so I was pretty excited to have something new for a change.    We came in at diner time, and went only for dinner, no drinks.  I looked at the menu and saw 10 dollars for three tacos, I thought it was kind of expensive, but maybe the tacos were really good.  I also ordered chips and salsa, and they weren't free. That was a joke.    I ordered one steak, one chicken, and one Chorizo and Egg.  The steak and the Chorizo and Egg were just terrible.  I had one in a hard shell, and one in a soft shell.  They tasted pretty much the same, and the texture was rubbery.    The Chicken was decent, and had a little flavor.    My Fiancee ordered the Vegetarian Tacos, which consisted of beans and green peppers and a hell of a lot more grease than anything I ordered.  One was so grease filled she had to throw it out.  They also had a Salsa Bar that had 4 different Salsas.  One had no taste, one had no taste but was hot, one tasted of onions, and the Green Verde salsa had a lot of flavor and was really spicy.  So 1for 4 is above average, right?  It's good in baseball I guess.  The soft shell tacos were a lot better than the hard shells, I would recommend if you have to eat there,  go for the soft.  Chicken rather than steak.  But hey, I gave Rubios 1 star, so this is at least a step up, but for a lot more money.
0	snrYD8Y5hb6tPiACUP8NbA	Now first off i'd like to say that I've only eaten here once, and if/when the day comes that I go back and decide what I wrote is wrong then I will change it... But, anyways. The look and decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy, the employees there were nice. Menu was really small. I tried the fried dumplings, they were average.. And I also had the ramen, only because that was the only option as a main dish, and I was not pleased at all, it was the second worst ramen i've ever had! :-/ Benefit of the doubt.. .. Maybe it's just not for me, I see alot of good reviews for this place. But then again, this is the point of reviews! :-)  Happy eating!
0	3TG9xPgK0cbaNWj0MI4euA	A wonderful Asian restaurant with the stated goal of bringing East Asian cuisine to the East Valley. The menu is a medley of foods from the East Asian bloc - think Thai, Japanese, Malaysian, Chinese and more. There is a seperate meny for sushi and the choices are unlimited. I sampled some sushi, tried one of the soups and ordered a noodle dish with chicken and shrimp and I was extremely satisfied with my choice. I did not try any dessert but, they had this unique cheesecake which looked awfully tempting. If only I had room left in the tank !   An added bonus of Oasian is the affable staff. I look forward to coming here in the future and maybe I can try that cheesecake.
0	X4fbqfuDo5XTQfgtdrIzA	Oh boy was I excited when I first walked into Rosie McCaffrey's.  An Irish pub right down the street?  This place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot.  Apparently, it wasn't disguised at all.  It really is just a local drunken hotspot.  I've been a moderate patron of Rosies for the past few months now, and while this is my usual watering hole of choice, there are a few things that need to be said about it.  First of all, the beer selection is good.  It isn't Yardhouse by a longshot, but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets.  The food is good for bar fare.  I felt much like a Irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections, I could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite.  The service is good, but prepare to wait if the place fills up (which it does) and you'll get looked over if you don't have cleavage (which I don't) but it helps if you're on a first name basis with the staff (which I am).  The music is varied, which is nice.  On the nights where live music is playing, you'll get a spattering of Irish folk music or recent covers.  I'm a fan of a few bands that play there, but to be completely honest, there have only been a few occasions where I've found my toes tapping.  But it's lively and fun, pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself.  You'll find a wide range of characters that frequent Rosies, though.  From the bar rats, greased woman hunters, drunken floozies, haughty better-than-alls and down home boys, there is never a lack of people to talk to.  I can't guarantee a good experience, but who can?  But I wouldn't worry, if you're using the place as you should, you won't remember tomorrow morning anyway.  No matter it's flaws, Rosie McCaffery's is worth a visit at least.  Grab a bite, take a shot of Irish courage and mix it up with a stranger.  If you see a fellow standing to the side, people watching with a silent amused smirk, come and say hello.  I probably won't bite.
0	Qqc4CBqNgS1z8t2DRqM8Vw	I'm just seconding everything that Lindsey said about this place.  It definitely ain't the fanciest digs around, but it's not the type of place you go for the ambiance.  You head to Fuji to get some excellent Japanese good at really good prices.  The staff - because the chef's come out to say hi before - are all very nice and attentive.  Once we were seated near their sound system - a boom box (see, not fancy) - and it was a little too loud and we asked if we could turn it down.  They said sure, apologized (although it wasn't anything to apologize about) and brought us a free roll which was way above and beyond what anyone would have expected.  Man, now I think I know what I'm going to eat tonight.
0	1T63HoSjMYSGjeQLs9y5A	I prefer to order for delivery because of the convenience. This establishment makes it very difficult.  Last time I ordered General TSO's they omitted the broccali and also the rice.  I have never in my life heard of General Tso's without either (Even the frozen cheap entree's you get from Aldi's grocery have this included).   The latest idiocy, I wanted sweet and sour chicken without the breading.  Easy, simple... right???  NOPE,  spent 5 minutes trying to explain that I just wanted to omit the breading. How feckin' hard is that???  I'll walk over to Little Tokyo from now on.  The exercise and food there is worth the small inconvenience, plus the owner is really nice at Tokyo Bistro.  MARY (Last time i'll order from you people!)
0	7SAjOgUnIyBak5hoQ0qFIw	I like this place quite a bit.  Nice atmosphere albeit a bit dark.  And the food is pretty decent for the price.   I would say they have one of the BEST filet mignon's under $20 ($19 to be exact) that you can get anywhere 24 hours a day.  Most of the appetizers are pretty good too.
0	knIs2q3Cq76WZNI0WkpA	The people working here are nice and the inside is clean. I had howie bread and that was hard and the pizza sauce that came with it tastes terrible. I liked the thickness of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself really lacked flavor. The pepperoni and sausage on my pizza did taste okay but the pizza all together just wasn't anything special. The amount of toppings on the pizza was fair. There was supposed to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but I tasted nothing but a so-so pizza crust. I'm a big boy who can eat a lot and could only eat 1 and a half pieces. I'm not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actually has taste to it.
0	LvKHX05qLC78bwLCYLsNow	I decided to give Cherry's Berries a try because it's in close proximity to my gym. The inside is surprisingly clean and I question whether it's from lack of customers or because an employee is going around frequently sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables.   I ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie.  When I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened.   The lack of fresh fruits and low quality ingredients make the smoothies taste icy  and artificial.
0	0Ce04Xsl81QKEhCBnLuew	Old Chicago is a chain restaurant I never knew existed, even though I'm from the Chicago area.  Oh wait, that's because Old Chicago has NOTHING to do with the city of Chicago itself.  It's based in Boulder, Colorado.  This would explain why the "Chicago-Style Pizza" was...not Chicago-style.  Yes, it's pizza baked in a pan, with a thickish crust, but when the sauce is not on top, it's not Chicago-style.  GET IT RIGHT OR PAY THE PRICE (to quote a favorite childhood TV show).  Moving on.  I perused the website before we went, and was excited to see that on Thursday nights, they have $2.50 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris.  I mean, $2.50??  Hell yeah!  See below:  http://oldchicago.com/champaign/specials  When I mentioned these specials to the waitress, she looked dumbstruck.  After checking with her manager, she came back and said all they had were margaritas.  I sighed and said, sure, I'd have a margarita.  When she brought it, she informed me that she'd only charge me $2.50 for that one, but nothing else, because they didn't do specials anymore.  I responded that that was fine, but maybe they should TAKE THE SPECIALS OFF THEIR WEBSITE?  I mean, just a thought.  Oh wellz, the margarita was gross anyway.  The one redeeming thing about Old Chicago is that it has a ridiculous beer selection.  Like, in the triple digits.  I have to respect that.  Otherwise, this place is pretty mediocre.
0	WmDPWBT07Zi2WMgwF10Zg	Went there at 1230pm to grab lunch to go with a friend, I have had a terrible wait time. The restaurant has had a bad way of dealing with orders when they experience a large queue, as such I had to wait over 20 mins for a pork souvlaki pita, when one usually should wait no longer than 10 mins for a pita. My friend who ordered a souvlaki platter was waiting for even longer, and what was more ridiculous that someone who ordered the same pork souvlaki platter after my friend got his order before my friend did.  The pita was poorly wrapped and I had some tzatziki spill on me whilst I was opening up my lunch. This was really poorly done by the restaurant.   The food is alright and is the best Greek restaurant within the university region, but I really hope that their staff have better procedures on how to operate during rush hours.
0	GBIT2U0fVLCOXZVTeEXjag	Hubby and I spent the weekend in Vegas. Tried this place one morning, and The Egg and I the next. Blueberry Hill wins, no contest. Moist, flavorful veggie omelet and the shoestring potatoes were by far the best I've ever had. Freshly made, not frozen, browned crispy. My blue berry muffin was outstanding, not overly sweet.  Hubby had a Scramble but I can't remember which one. He loved it, and he's hard to please. Service was good, even tho the waitress seemed to be having a tiff with a customer. Prices were beyond reasonable. We'd go back for all our breakfasts in Vegas.
0	untJY5sCA7nOgRLkiUQ	Hands down the best bagels in Madison. Their bagel breakfast sandwiches are made with real, fresh ingredients, putting Einsteins to shame. You'll really taste the difference.  We liked the food, service, atmosphere, value, bagels, super tasty food, real italian sausage patties, fresh eggs, food served in charming wicker baskets, smooth espresso, quality wood furnishing, seeing bagels being made, the nice clean space and filling food.  We disliked that there were no chairs - only stools, no posted menu, no specific food pickup location, and that the staff was not prepared for unusual requests and obviously were not native English speakers.
0	3sWK6MBgDh3L3VA55OKWg	Love the ambiance of this cafe in Lawrenceville, located very close to Piccolo Forno and the 40th street bridge.  I had heard great things about the restaurant and was excited to try it out.    The place is packed and with a lengthy waitlist on Sunday mornings.  We got there and had our name on the list by 10:45 am and still had to wait about an hour to get seated.  And then, getting our meals took a long time also.  I actually went with the server's suggestion and got a special (smoked salmon frittata) - not the best, it turns out.  The frittata was especially dense and nothing to write home about and it came with 2 small pieces of smoked salmon on top.  Hmmm.  The french toast and sage ham meals that I saw looked good, and probably would be my choice the next time.  Later, I heard that avoiding the specials and sticking to the basics of the menu is usually your best bet.    Price-wise, it's about on par with other brunch locations in the city.  While a bit more inconvenient with respect to the wait and location, I am sure I will be back here for the different menu options and the charm of the cafe.
0	v5NLIWXoKcGrYMrTUtOP2Q	This place seems to have a split personality. When I have ordered through the drive-through (which I don't recommend if you have a large SUV or aren't so good with the steering) the sandwiches came exactly as ordered and the window person was very friendly (there was one guy who was *really* friendly, which was amusing and flattering to a middle-aged mom in a minivan). But the last two or three times I have gotten delivery the order was wrong.   The last time I got delivery two of the three sandwiches were COMPLETELY wrong. (Once time I used the website and ordered my sandwich without avocado because my GI tract just can't tolerate the stuff and it came with all kinds of avocado. Grrrr.) I called back as soon as I discovered it and was told that the driver had packed the bag wrong. Honestly, I didn't care who screwed up - I just wanted my #13 on french! The person on the phone didn't seem too bothered by it, either.   Once I got the correct sandwiches they were very good, but the experience left a bitter taste.
0	lGgWwkUPwoQCANYugw1Huw	the rating is more like 2.5. oh this isn't a hate review. Read for details   I guess this is family owned, and we went on a thursday afternoon and it was half full according to me for thursday lunch. She got a deal for this place (10 for 20 groupon) and that' why I went there, I generally tend to stay away from Asian Buffets, because  1. they dont have many vegetarian options. 2. They don't really differentiate much between vegetarian and meat, even when it comes to preparation, so don't be surprised if you see an occasional meat piece in your "vegetarian food".  Like i said that is my general observation after being to several of these places. But let's see what's the story at this Thai Buffet   Reason for the 2 stars ( or shud we say Pros)  - Really Friendly people.  Both the old lady (cook?) and the teenage girl (server) were really friendly and tried their best to be personal.  - Amazing desert (coconut sticky Rice?) check the pic - Trying to set up something of a different buffet for a change, I like the concept of a Thai buffet (which for people who don't know is way different from a regular Asian Buffet)  Reason for the LACK of 3 stars ( cons, really)  - No vegetarian options, absolutely NO Options. Oh the rice paper Vietnamese role counts, but does it entail the entire buffet? Thai food has so many lovely vegetarian options, but it was sad to see the place not even try to make a single entree.  - I just feel there was one lady back there preparing everything on her own, so basically when she goes in, she comes back after 20-30 mins with a dish, all along people just wait for it, because the 1-2 dishes out here are empty, what kind of buffet does one havta wait? Eventually people just give up and leave, is this a strategy? Just saying!    - When I asked the old lady about it, she said she will make something but never came out or to me with it until I was done eating, guess she just wanted me to leave lol.  - Finally when I asked again, the old lady came out with egg rolls and she told me the reason they were late was because she had put the 'frozen' egg rolls in the oven too long and a few parts were burnt so she cut them off and brought me the rest. I was like :| (Frozen, really? I could go to costco and buy them myself, whatever happened to making somethin? and really cut the burnt parts and bring me the rest?)  - Oh they didnt even have a drink in the buffet, so basically I had nothing to eat & drink at all.   Anyhow, I would love to come back and check it again in future, if they do make some changes about the cons above, & ofc if they have something veggie other than costco frozen rolls.   But if not anything I just would love to come back and say hi to the wonderful people at Thai Buffet. Like I said, this was never a hate review, I just feel like there is tremendous potential for improvement to a lovely idea.
0	APoI4ZqJo3pcEHLcqRJNxw	First time going into the restaurant. My wife told me to give it a try, so, what the heck! Needs to work on the decor. The server was good. Needs to check the table a little more.   Food, Tiradito de Pescado and Lomo saltado to start. The fish was tasty, the sauce need a little more cream. The saltado, over cooked beef, salty, three pieces of tomato but still eat it. Entree was a Jalea. The amount perfect for two people. The flavor was really good. I give them props on that, the only thing was the onions. Wow, thank god that there was mint on the cashier because I literally cried. Those where the strongest non-washed red onions that I've ever try in my life. I ask for extra lemon to kill the gas that came out of them every time I ate them.   The menu, small to start.  Prices are fare for the area that is located but should have more publicity. Peruvians go by word of mouth when it comes to food.  But one thing that they have in advantage over other places is the space. They should try a buffet like the one in Huntington Beach, CA. That place is always packed. Sure, compared to the amount of Peruvians there to here in Las Vegas huge difference.
0	xHATH7scwNaaK5QDujK90A	There's just something funny about a white guy and his latin boyfriend noshing on soul food in the desert. But what's not funny is how dee lish the food is here at Lil Mama's. And how fun just to say lil. Perhaps the two t's and the e at the end put them over on their sign budget. But I like it. Lil Thomas likes it. The enormous serving of fried chicken was crisp and succulent. Yes, I said succulent. How many of you have used that word today? Side of red beans and rice were faboo. Five stars to the mac and cheese and collard greens. The smothered chops were not my fave and I would try another main dish. Perhaps the catfish? Huge tumblers of sweet tea to chase down this caloric feast hit the spot. The space is sparce with vintage looking  African American art. I noticed a performace space near the front window. The ham in me wanted to jump up there and do the Steve Martin front porch dance from The Jerk.
0	WoiIRK70QBr4vXwgPEhISg	Order the $55 dollar omakase. If you're especially hunger add the black cod with foie gras.  The cooked food I thought was generally better than the sushi.  Priced better than most of the sushi places on the strip, but it's a little bit far if you're considering taking a cab.
0	y7ar8jybY3Eck8UXf5YGg	I have yet to have an unpleasant experience here. Besides the fantastic beer options, everything I have ordered from here I enjoy from salads to sandwiches and pasta. I mean a nice tasty cheeseburger with fries(or salad if you choose to avoid fried objects) and a pint of beer for $9. How can you say no? I just wish it was open a little bit later.
0	kpgijqa5fOmjEYFO3YSpiA	Do you love food?  We flew into Charlotte for a short weekend.  I yelped for a restaurant for Friday night dinner, early, and was fortunate to pick TFT.  Set in an remodeled older home the tree is welcoming and a comfortable environment.  The menu hits of a creative chef who keeps a southern menu balanced with a creative approach.  We tried a few appetizers (the purse and the tart) and a few salads (the caesar and the beet).  All were perfect.  The entrees were very yummy.  I had a seared tuna which made my day.   The waiter, Ty, was perfect as well.  Just friendly enough to make us feel welcome while knowing when to back away and give us space.   I promise if you love food and you want to enjoy a great little restaurant try this place.  Next trip to Charlotte we will go back.
0	BW1Xoxoc9WmWbQwbuLQuCg	This restaraunt is in a fairly rundown strip mall in Glendale. The interior of the restaraunt was plenty spacious and clean but extremely dark, even at mid day. The food was reasonably tasty and wonderfully spiced but the luncheon menu was pretty limited. I had the goat stew and my lunch guests had the Yam Porridge, all of which was heartily consumed and enjoyed. The portion sizes were good and the overall eating experience was as well. The server was friendly and well mannered but extremely inattentive even though there were very few people in the restaraunt.  When we were ready to order we actually had to get up and summon him to the table.  Several items that were on the menu were actually not available to order.  The food though good was in my opinion overpriced ($55 for three at lunch, including meals, sodas and tax). Though I am happy I had an opportunity to experience and enjoy the meal, it is unlikely that I will return to this restaraunt and would only recommend it to friends for the purpose of enjoying a meal as a distinctive change of pace.
0	yda0cGxuEn6sSJmOlDgA	Very underwhelmed.  The black beans tasted as if they had been sitting around for a very long time (days)- almost sour and the shredded beef tasted old.  While we loved the fried cheese sticks, it just isnt enough for me to want to go back.    I am very glad this was discovered via Groupon or I would've been even more disappointed.
0	Sc35WosPiAcO2vL6TaRgw	Got me some pho, and it came with a standard metal spoon and didn't come with any cilanto or mint leaves. Service was less than exceptional. However, the Japanese Dancing with the Stars knockoff on TV was pretty entertaining.
0	A9s7QniYi5Mx2o9QZC9d1w	. I guess for $7.99 you get what you pay for although I was hoping for a surprise. Anyway, it's fine. Salsas mild to bland, pork in salsa verde: okay, tamales: okay...I could go on, but you at the point. Decor and a look at the buffet left me very nervous too...
0	IS1o3VAeBAITqrU1Mo6Q	A solid choice for breakfast. Unless you are in a large group there is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the place appears to be packed.  Friendly service, and the pumpkin bread is to die for. There have been times I was tempted to stop in just to buy a piece of the pumpkin bread to go. The omelets are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater.   Never had anything other then breakfast so not sure how the lunch food is.
0	RqJ5UvV5CqHcb8ISUqQw	While the chimichanga tasted great, i had diarrhea for atleast a week. Place did not look clean. I lived in guatemala for a while, and i like street food, but this just looked dirty.  Their sanitation standards looked sketchy
0	Yk5EAlVnSsepjPhjEkppVg	So I was rather surprised on the fish sandwich. It was actually really good and it appeared that they do their batter for the fish! However the onion rings sucked hardcore! They tasted like straight up vegetable oil!  So in the end I love this place but I do not recommend the onion rings.  Also the servers are hit or miss when it comes to their looks.
0	YzHfRVb8woLyhsF5KP7A	We were so looking forward to this place opening.   Ehhh, a bit of a disappointment.  Very clean, very friendly (counter) service.  But the food just...well let me explain.  I ordered a gyros.  Combo of beef and lamb and that's fine.  But the meat had way too much pepper in it.  60 minutes later I still tasted pepper.  The tzatziki was ok,,,something was missing - maybe a bit more cucumber?   My partner ordered chicken schwarma.  Her complaint was that the chicken was chopped up - heavily chopped up.  Hard to eat because the sandwich kept falling apart. She expected and would have preferred thinly sliced meat and more garlic in the garlic sauce.  We split a small greek salad.  Again, just ok.  The dressing was mostly oil and vinegar - not enough spices except oregano and probably no dijon in it at all.  Menu?  Basically a bunch of sandwiches in the $5-$7 range or add $2.50 and you get fries or rice or a small salad and a drink.  So would we go back?  Probably not.  If I start seeing better reviews, we might try once more.  Sure would like them to add a bit to the menu...like taramosalata, pastitsio, moussaka, or maybe souvlaki?  And for goodness sake, one of the fun parts of a greek restaurant is watching them shave the meat off the revolving spool.  Maybe Gyros Town doesn't do that, but if they do, they ought to bring the spool out from the backroom, so people can watch their sandwich being made.
0	lp84W3q3NdEFwzJJ0yBVQ	I am not a huge fan of Zaxbys.  If it is nearby I will go, but it is never a destination for me.  This restaurant is slower than most and I agree partially with other reviews regarding the unruly staff.  This is a regional chain and if you want something unique this isn't the place.  I usually keep it simple and get chicken fingers.
0	LwxgCsdrs2GxNxnq1KtTlQ	This place is recommended fairly highly mostly for how the meal starts out.  They bring out oil and warm bread but they sprinkle spices on a small plate before pouring the oil.  It is a simple but the best olive oil and bread combination I have had at any Italain restaurant.  They have 2 outstanding appetizers:  the Scotty Thompson and calamari with red sauce.  They have another sauce but it's not good.  The Scotty Thompson is off-menu and not always available.  It is a simple bruschetta with cheese and red sauce that is surprisingly good.  Their soups are good to outstanding.  My favorite is the spicy sausage and lentil but it's not always available.  Their soups are better than their salads.  The house is bland and the Ceasar's not much better.  When it comes to entrees they drop off a bit.  B&B and Circo are better but their steak and double pork chop marsalas are pretty good.    For 2 people who share an appetizer and don't get wine, you can keep it under $60 including the tip.  We have never gotten to dessert because we are stuffed by then.  As a value, it is definitely recommended.
0	tLtGUvgSqyN4YzYIqjgfEQ	Great atomsphere.    Friendly staff.      Great food.     Love their bean dip.    One of the best small mexican restaurants in the valley.    Great spanish corn.   Their cheese sauces [spinach-tops] are wonderful.
0	FhtMQce7VclEhliEsQkQ	We used to visit this Barros when they first opened, it seems it has gone down hill. We ordered a couple slices for lunch and the crust was drenched in oil and rubber like it was microwaved. It may have been the workers that were here this particular day. I believe in second chances ill try this location again if not better next trip, peace out.
0	1MvmzZjFP79w4sUV42kOA	I like to think of this place as a secret lunch weapon.  It's small, grubby, and not very visible from the street.   The food is really great, and they are unbelievably quick about preparing it. Bonus points for using liberal amounts of hot pepper in spicy dishes when requested. I can take it!  Extremely inexpensive, too.
0	BvSU2mDahHy0jfwF2g	If you know the saying, "What goes up must come down," then you might be familiar with the saying, "Mexican food goes in solid and comes out liquid."  I've never been a taco bell fan either, so maybe "quick" Mexican fare just isn't my thing. To each their own, I guess. Perk is that it's 24 hours in a residential area, but it's just not my speed.
0	HREe4g3oYuQQLLPKhCPh3A	All that it was said to be and then some. The food was excellent, the service was good. The only thing I didn't like was the wait for a table. We waited about 15 min., however, we didn't have a reservation and still it was worth the wait.
0	gNUd1eDZuofa8OsX6xfg5A	Service was good and friendly staff , But the pizza was underdone and not crispy at all even if it had burnt marks all over, considering the price and the size of pizza is  not what i was expecting , lived in italy for 15 years and never had a pizza like this so to call this authentic is a joke, not to mention the fact that it sat in my stomach all night , will not go again
0	v5CrByGCVPnGuwS1nuauQ	I found a stellar jalapeno burger here! The burger was meaty and juicy.  It comes with salsa but I chose to have that left off. My husband got the same burger with salsa and it was super messy! I can't stand messy burgers. You can always get the salsa on the side but I thought the burger was spicy enough without it.
0	vi3m24NSNWaSWJWVqCQU1Q	I love the charm of the businesses on or near Water St.   I had a mad craving for some deli food and I scoured Yelp until I found this gem. I was thrilled when I saw that they delivered! Straight to my house came a friendly delivery girl, who I happily and hungrily greeted. I had an amazing sandwich full of avocado, turkey, and sprouts. I had an amazing iced coffee drink that mixed bananas and chocolate. I want to say it's called the Funky Monkey? My son also had a taste-packed sandwich but I can't recall what I ordered him as I was busy with my own luscious meal. (sorry kid, Mommy DOES love you..almost as much as she loves food)  Since that first delivery experience, I've taken friends for smoothies and ice cream, and they appreciated the fact that there were many smoothie options not including dairy or soy, and with an array of fruit combos.   Definitely my choice when I want a deli feel, with added perks of ice cream, smoothies, and coffee drinks to lust over.   Even better? They dont mind showing up at my doorstep ready to hand over my food, even when I look like a crazed, caffeine deprived maniac.
0	AgKX6WNPG9OhvWvqz1as7Q	This restaurant should have really good food. The quality looks good. I couldn't figure out why it doesn't have more flavor. The person who took my to go order says it is all cooked to order. The steak and chicken seem like they should taste good. I take it to the plane and something has the flavor of a funky steam table. I think it may be the tortillas which seem hand made. So really they should be good. Maybe it all sits on a steam table. This airport desperately needs a good place and people are willing to remember it... Such as Oaxaca which used to be awesome but is also outside of security. This is near gate C 11 I think. The manager should taste the food. It could be really good. No flavor at all. Oh and this entry says American food. It is definitely Mexican.
0	QUjFRoSJEbkqIUekkrU9A	Trendy Japanese sushi place! 4/5  We went to Yasu for the Valentine's Day. We were very impressed by the food but a bit dissapointed at the service and table set-up there. We were seated at the corner with both of our chairs facing the crowd (very tiny space to move around). We couldn't adjust it to our comfort level and were in very awkward position the entire night. Other than that, we would go back again for the food!
0	tUr3zvzIDxsYPH0BTqWtQ	Americanized Pho doesn't quit work out. Watered down Pho and Thai tea. Good enough for a hangover though.  I guess they were missing the MSG or something.  But if your drink and can't get off the strip, this is your spot.  And yes, chicken pho was 13 dollars and 4 spring rolls were 10.  Thai tea was 5 bucks.  Minus well went to buffet.
0	qTcZ3jmlC1IWMTyT8p9kYA	Overpriced.  Carne Asada fries is $9.16!  Carne asada chips is $8 (about $.50-1.00 more than most places)  The chips are already expensive.  Why does it cost an extra $1.16 to substitute fries?  I had a california burrito.  It didn't have guacamole.  The first rule of carne asada is that it should always have guacamole.
0	g8WqyjMJaAC3X7Ib6BXrnw	I absolutely hate this McDonalds.  But I frequent it because we frequent this Walmart, so I have to give it two and not one stars because of how often we are here.  This place is always too busy and too crowded. Always seems a little dirty (because it is so busy) and for the first time ever, I went to a McDonald's and they were out of water in the soda machine. I was just dumbfounded.  The workers here are either great or need a lot of improvement. Most of them lean towards the latter.
0	QoG903K8L7t9qKo3IDipGQ	how disappointing!  the Qdobas in NYC are pretty good - they have to compete with Chipotle after all, who i think puts crack in their food because it's so addictive.  here though, after multiple tries, i just got mediocre bland food in many forms.  too bad because i know it can be good.
0	dkvb7If4UJlSdfeyJLr53g	I went here on a Thursday evening to find this place busy, but disappointing. I found the interior decor very confusing. I felt like I was in a warehouse, very tall ceilings, no wall decorations and concrete floors. We sat at a table and couldn't help but slide around constantly because of the slippery floor and chairs. Also in the middle on the restaurant there is a weird ice cream bar. Not sure who thought putting a 50's diner bar in a contemporary restaurant was a good idea. As for food; it tasted good, but the portions were terribly small. The burger was the size of something you would see in a kids meal and cost $10 without fries. Drinks were also very expensive, $15 for a whiskey and coke. Service was slow, however the bus boy was very helpful. In summary there are many better burger choices in town for a lot less money. The only reason I gave two stars was because it was tasty. I will not be going back.
0	sqzBbmJ1EDJAeGXOuD3DyQ	Good food for delivery food. I order here pretty often now that I know about this hidden gem. The lady who answer is super nice. They have a variety and everything that I had was pretty good. Delivery might take a hour but well worth it
0	W3iLXGChW96TkDAdUggxw	The best Benihana ever! This place is visually stunning! It has that indoor/outdoor design that Vegas is soo fond of. You know when you're indoors but looks like your outside(kinda). What is that called? Anyways imagine your in a Japanese tea garden...at night. There is a pink, orange and purple sunset and the occasional fireworks display. A stream, bridge and lots of cherry blossom trees. The actual dining area  is inside of a house which is inside of the inside/outside tea garden, overlooking the stream. A hostess dressed in full kimono attire escorts you to your table. Other than all that, it's just a regular old Benihana...
0	HWw96rZDRLuLGPVglQFYA	I love Chinese food.  I love Mexican food (or at least, Ameri-mex).   What better idea than to put these two together?  These guys are freakin geniuses.  I got jade chicken in a burrito, how cool is that?    It would be 5 stars, but I, honestly, didn't think the food blew me away.  It was good, and it was inventive, but not mindblowing.    One thing I did think was really cool was the little cinnamon flavored hockey puck you get for dessert.  It's not like the southern Snickerdoodles I've had before, but it's odd, which means it perfectly fits.
0	K6xihoo6DiipSeGY1Mbn0w	The food is usually fine. However, we use the drive through at least once a week and I would say that 1/3 to 1/2 the time something is wrong or missing from the order. Make sure to check your bags before driving away.
0	NFs0thPAXOeLVdcUI9rw	Went there for breakfast. Coffee was served luke warm. My wife's pancakes tasted sour. Server didn't really seem to care when we complained. My chicken fried steak was pretty good, but nothing special. We generally like Timbers for drinks and dinner items, but they failed on this morning. Probably won't be going back to this one, especially for breakfast.
0	cbqAx73UPh9Uqn1km1UzxQ	When I got there the place was empty and looked like just a bar. Their dining room was not set up (it was 5:30), and it looked sort of seedy. Then a charming young woman showed up and apologized, and set me up. Her service was great. I just wished the food was better. The salad was a little too chopped, and the main dish (Carmen asada) was tough and sort if bland. The rice and beans were also bland and we're served with dry flaky tortillas. Sorry but probably won't be back.
0	zlQHbnPAAIBuCQbr1uVDTw	Can't go wrong with Panera!  Their menu is big enough (and tasty enough) to pretty much eat every meal here.  I usually just go for lunch.  Lately I have been doing their "Pick Two" option for lunch so 1/2 salad and 1/2 a sandwich or 1/2 a sandwich and a cup of soup... mix and match.  It was a little crowded today, I thought the rain would force everyone to stay indoors, so there was some jockeying going on for tables (since it was also cold outside).  Had a bowl of warm broccoli cheddar soup with half a tuna sandwich on honey wheat.  Hit the spot.
0	wk0cI46PPlAasFNGladJYw	Been here a few times.  I'm not a big Denny's fan but choices are limited in San Tan area.  Always expect a wait on weekends.  But staff seems to try their best to get you seated quickly.  Food is average.  Service though I think is sub-par.  I get the sense the place is not managed well.  However I see from another reviewer maybe they have new management and things have improved?  Not sure.  I'm willing to try again but not enthused about going back.    My most recent visit was about 2 months ago.  It took forever to get our food.  Our waitress claimed to have checked on our order and said it would be right out.  This was after about 20-30 min.  Then a manager came over and checked on our order.  He apologized and said it was being worked on now.  So implication is our waitress did not check our order and it was lost or not put in.  Not good.  I think that explains why I have not been back since.
0	YVpDTgGZShdJVUt7nYZ3iw	Went here with some friends at their recommendation.  Menu was nothing special, but the food was tasty.  No alcohol offered, but BYO is OK.  Service was fair to OK, but not very attentive once orders were taken.  Overall, I won't go back here, as there are too many other more appealing places.
0	j09oZ8vk9AxS6sQM5vuRQQ	I love how this restaurant is encased by huge windows and offers beautiful views of the area.  I had dinner here last month and was very impressed.  Everything on the menu sounded so simple but was presented very artistically.  The Chips and Fish was a surprise.  I'd never had sea scallops prepared like flat potato chips.  It was delicious.  The Winter Squash Bisque was warm, velvety and awesome.  I liked how they used the almond brittle to add a different texture but I didn't prefer it that much.  The American Berkshire Pork was a little too salty from the salt and pepper crust for me, but it was very tasty and cooked perfectly along with the brussel sprouts.  The Organic Norwegian Salmon was perfect.  I loved the balsamic reduction and the crispy leeks - wow!  We didn't have room for dessert but we were given a complementary small box of two pieces of chocolate made by Madison chocolatier Gail Ambrosius.  The chocolate was incredible and  it was the perfect end to our Valentine's Day dinner!
0	dmzIS8uD1Ov1TXcnYUUIZg	Like many other reviewers here, I was confused by the attire of the female servers. However, they all seemed very nice and helpful.  The decor is really nice and when you match that to the menu prices, they seem to want an affluent customer.    However, the food was just ok especially for the price.  I had the green chile burger and it was average at best.  I thought the bun was too dry for my tastes so I finished my burger sans bun.  The fries or "frites" were nothing special either.  Today, with so many gourmet / upscale burger offerings in the market, this doesn't really measure up.    As someone who works in the Esplanade, I really want Del Frisco's to succeed so I'll try them out again sometime soon. I've been told the steak salad is excellent, so I'll order that next time.
0	LQFEanrJmTOPK5aQIxF60A	It's the Piggy Mac that warranted two stars, they cheesy Lovers was just a mess. The Piggy Mac consisted of bbq pork with jalapenos and mac n cheese ($6). The potential was there, but the wheat bread choice was really poor. The Cheesy Lovers Delight with Bacon ($5) was not good on any level. Dry flimsy bread, congealed cheese and bland bacon. Yes, bland bacon. Seems like an oxymoron doesn't it?
0	vquLymirEjLenatEMTlw	I used to work here and I have to tell you that I wish i still did.  The food here is awesome!!  They have a cafe and a fine dining area for lunch.  The food is phenomenal.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is really hard to find.
0	WUM4KzDSIIjgQkxBu8aJA	Coming from Southern California, one would think that I would be tired of south-of-the-border cuisine as I visited Las Vegas. Perhaps Mexican food is in my comfort zone, but as I strolled through New York-New York around dinner time, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez sounded very appetizing.  It's a small restaurant, with many tables outnumber the few booths. Our waitress was below average to everyone she was serving, though my party and I noted that the other waiters seemed more attentive. The bar served 48 oz frozen margaritas, which could be seen on many of the dining tables. It's also good to note that there is a wide selection of tequila and margaritas offered.  Like many Mexican restaurants (at least in California), chips and salsa were presented as starters. The salsa was amazing, with the chips not lacking either. I ordered a chicken enchilada and chicken burrito two item combo, along with a mojito. The mojito was delicious; the drink was almost green from the mint. Both the enchilada and burrito did not disappoint, either. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauces covering each item were delicious. The beans were tasty, but the rice was not good. It tasted like the microwavable kind.   Overall, the food was very good, and well-priced. I was surprised to find it comparable to the great Mexican-American food chains found in California.
0	oZmk2tKPnr0pt3DYpTD3fg	Since this place is an affordable & casual eatery close to the neighborhood, I really wanted to like it.  I really, really did. But, alas, it was a major disappointment to me!  Really, two words sum it up: BLAND FOOD.  The portion size was fine -  but the taste and overall quality of the food was really bland and not the highest quality.   They also did not have what I consider to be a good selection of breakfast offerings.    Sometimes I don't mind sacrifing a little quality for price - if there are some other major redeeming values - but this is not the case at the Charlotte Cafe.    I had eggs, "homefries", a couple of slices of  tomato (to substitute for the meat since they don't offer any alternatives to pork products --- no turkey bacon or chicken sausage here), and a blueberry pancake.  Sadly, everything on my plate was bland and basically lacked any  seasoning.  The blueberry pancake was definitely the "best" thing on my plate, but  at times it had a bit of an odd after-taste that I can't really put my finger on. (Maybe it was the cheap syrup, but I can't be sure.) The "homefries" looked good, but actually just tasted like diced potatoes  with a light sprinkling of paprika on them and were almost undercooked. The eggs were scrambled ok - but again nothing to them taste-wise. The tomato -is a typical hot-house tomato that is flavorless.  The coffee didn't taste great either. I usually drink mine black, but this coffee needed something to cover the taste, so I ended up using a little creamer (yucky).     My friend had egg whites, sausage, hashbrowns and a belgan waffle. His food was "ok" except for the waffle which tasted exactly like those waffles you make at "free breakfast " when you stay at a Homewood or Comfort Suites hotel (You know, the ones where you pour the pre-made waffle mix into the waffle iron and lt cooks for a few minutes on each side.)  He was totally disappointed with the waffle and did not eat it. He had coffee and an orange juice.   Now, to be fair, there were a few things that we did like about the place... it's a cute little place that you can get in and out of quickly.  And on our visit (Sunday AM) the employees were friendly and helpful - especially our server.   However, we do not plan to go back.  Our total check came to $26 for 2 people for breakfast before the tip.  (At that price,  we can eat at Le Peep and have a HUGE selection.... I always end up getting an awesome omelette w/flavorful home-fries there).   As a side note, later that same day, I heard from someone else who had eaten there on a number of occasions who consistently got cold food served and on his final visit, had a really bad experience with the manager.
0	cq3ElnzR1rBi1BkbVZHQ	As a daily diner in downtown Phoenix, I'll be surprised if the doors to this place stay open for more than 6 months.  I was so excited to have The Breakfast Club open in downtown and now I hazard to say even First Watch (which is hospital cuisine at best) far exceeds what I had at the Breakfast Club in CityScape.  I've now been to this restaurant three times since it opened hoping for an exceptional experience and I'm totally underwhelmed.  Today, I brought 2 family members to the restaurant and even though the service was exceptional, the quality of the food was horrible and it was all cold.  We had pre-cooked cardboard bacon, flavorless sausage patties, petite pancakes, and ice cold eggs.  Plating was haphazard and uninviting and worse of all, every hot dish was ice cold.  Since I was already at this location 2 times and each time I had to send food back because it was cold, I knew to order my syrup hot.  That was the only way we could eat the pancakes without sending them back.  Considering this is a breakfast restaurant, I can't believe they find it so difficult to serve hot, flavorful food.  I really hope they immediately step up their effort because Matt's Big Breakfast, Cartel Coffee, and sadly First Watch have nothing to worry about.  I've waited too long to see downtown Phoenix succeed and unfortunately without remedial action, the Breakfast Club will not be a part of it.
0	UjjFxjJQ9e0VWfmUBpYCA	what a bummer of an experience.the pizza is pretty good but every time we go there the customer service is lacking. Twice I have called to order a pizza for pick up and have been put on hold for 5 minutes plus, only to hang up and call right back and get help right away which makes me think that they forgot about me. Today I went to pick up my pizza and was ignored for quite some time and when I asked to have a coupon since they had a stack of hundreds if not thousands on the counter behind them was told no even though the gentleman before me had received plenty of free ranch dressings.
0	X4Np9VMAXvm8g4mQOHUSug	When my Italian chef friend brings me here I know that I'm at real Italian spot.  The restaurant has a great family restaurant feel and does it right.  Challenge this restaurant by finding your favorite  authentic Italian dish.   My advice, get the special.    This place is great for amazing food for a fair price.
0	rrmgVXivO49AMylM2WhH9Q	Recently opened in Bruntsfield, Project Coffee is a hip new coffee shop and wears the label on its sleeve. The staff are all really unfriendly, which doesn't bode well for a new coffee shop.   Good things: for a reasonable price, you can get a full breakfast at any time of the day.   One day I ordered eggs benedict and was really disappointed. The hollandaise sauce was just appalling.   The interior has no character, but they have shiny bronze tables that look like the inside of a vintage train carriage.   It's trendy and exactly what you'd expect from a new coffee shop in Bruntsfield.
0	OylliX5aq9ryWn1fIBSyA	This place is about 2 miles from my house.  Lunch was horrible here. I have tried take out for dinner and after couple of times, it felt like the oil used was stale and food made me sick.   Eh...not going there again.
0	m8ilkV00Zu2y1p9PmSM8ug	Good intentions but a little iffy on food and delivery. Went in later (11:15)  and food took 40 minutes to come out with four of us ordering. Fish tacos had good mix and wonderful presentation but fish was not fresh and had that almost bad do I trust smell. Fries were enjoyed by all very heavy on garlic wonderful for the garlic aficionado. Margarita pizza good and garlic with a good balance of spice beyond the garlic unfortunately covered up by a little to much cheese taste. (to much cheese for a flatbread with good intention). Tomato soup and cheese sandwich were pusillanimous sandwich did not live up to the small but well balanced tomato. Atmosphere very nice and staff overworked but accommodating with great toons. This seemed like a non Vegas like place and considering this is a Marriott the day may be better as this has a little Mormon flair inherent in the fabric.
0	IEr17RSs5N1PgDaQlvCw5Q	A shrug-worthy meal, at best.   Went with a daily deal-type coupon and started off well with a tasty miso soup and gyoza, but when the sushi arrived, it was chock full of blah. Nothing special at all, and a really uninspired "chef's choice" selection.   You would think that a smart owner/manager would use the daily deal as advertising, entice people into his business at a small loss and serve up food that would leave the customer feeling like they must come back, quickly and often. That was certainly not the case. I left feeling like I was served the cheapest rolls I could be served. They were rolls that you could get in any sushi place, equal or better tasting and for less money.   Left very hungry and definitely UNsatisfied.  Our server ignored simple requests that would have made our dining experience better. Seemed like he could care less. The asian "manager" seemed to barely understand, so I decided to not bother leaving comments. (I had the same phone reservation experience as a previous Yelp'er.)  A while ago, I visited Aikawa and reviewed it, saying that the sushi was amazingly fresh but way overpriced. I have since told people about Aikawa in the context of "if you have money to burn and want really interesting sushi..."   As for Zento, I have absolutely no reason to recommend that anyone eat here, and I will definitely NOT be back.  1 1/2 stars for blah sushi, plus 1/2 star for very nice decor. Sadly, I didn't go to please my eyes, I went to please my mouth and stomach - and they both left unhappy.

We went w/ the green curry (the only thing my wife seems to order any Thai restaurant we go to) and I got the beef pad kee maw.  Throw in a big thai iced tea and the whole thing came to just a a few cents over $20.    This definitely would've been more at Krung Thai and Thai Spice so you simply can't beat the bangness for the buckness.
0	SAifG3fvZa2jtSAcDnUnTg	What's with all the hype??  2 hot dogs, an order of onion rings, a beer, and an alcoholic pink lemonade for $42. Damn you Vegas.  Everything was just really blehhhhh.. And the service sucked. What made it more unappealing was the fact that their freezer they put the onion rings in was right behind the cash register, so when I saw him take the giant, possibly 20 pound bag of onion rings and drop some into the fryer, they were unappetizing from the start.  Hot dogs can easily be made at home.. it's just a bunch of toppings on a regular-nothing special- tasting hot dog in a nothing special tasting bun.  Do yourselves a favor and go inside 10 steps and have yourself some Earl's! Now that's worth talkin' about!
0	feFvXclxWmpNFLe0Nk5vMw	Salsa enfuego!  I love this place.  After years of living on the East Coast, Dona Maria's got my fiance' to eat Mexican food.  I started him on the chips and worked him up to the tamales.    This is also a great place to bring out of town guests who don't want Strip crap.  Good stuff.
0	FjkNmZVuCOBv4jQWKp6w	We have gone several times in the past and enjoyed it, but if I had only gone once I would never go back after my last visit. The sesame chicken tasted burned. My husband and I were sharing it and sushi. She offered to take mine back and let me order another sushi roll saying it should come out fast. My hub was starving so he just ate his half burned. We were the only people in the restaurant and the guy you can watch making sushi still spent 10 mins watching tv before making my new order. She only offered us 1/2 off of the chicken she had taken away explaining that lots of people think it is burned on the days they fresh marinade and complain about it but that it was just the smoke in the soy sauce and charged us full price for the replacement food I had ordered. I was really annoyed and disappointed and honestly don't know why she didn't offer an explanation or solution before taking my food.
0	1xpKzz8XUpbaSD6GtEByA	I love El Polo Loco.  But this location is the worst!  It's like that ex-girlfriend you keep going back to, only to quickly remember she is crazy and might kill you in the night.   The service is so slow.  Like expect to wait 20 minutes.  Is this a gourmet restaurant - or fast food?  Maybe if the foot was edible it would be worth it.   But alas, the food is terrible.  Not once, not twice, but the five or six times I have eaten here in the past 3 years.  The chicken is ok, and that's why they got two stars.  Anything else, beans, avocados, even the chips are gross.  My favorite item (at other el polo locations) is the avocado burrito.  Here no good.  Cold chicken and beans and grainy avocado is not what I wanted.    Ugh.  I wish someday a new owner would take over this location and make it like the chain was designed to be.
0	a6DV3XKny5pqPx3jfhy7Fw	I was so excited to try this place. In fact, I showed up two days early hoping to try their burgers. Worth the wait? Ummm, No!  I ordered their bacon/avocado cheeseburger with their thousand island dressing on the side. I wasn't sure if I would like avocado with thousand island. Turns out-I didn't.   The burger showed up pretty quickly with no bacon or avocado on it. Since I paid for the extra items, I let them know what the problem was. The manager then comes to our table to make sure we were not hiding the bacon or avocado anywhere. Awkward!  He takes my burger back, and 30 seconds later bacon and avocado show up on my burger. I did like the bun they used-it was soft and had no sesame seeds. On the other hand, my wife ordered the standard cheeseburger with pickles and mustard only. Sesame seeds showed up on that burger? I am not sure why the difference. ..  The fries were ok-- although s little under seasoned for my liking. The onion rings tasted like leather with coating thicker than my ex-wifes makeup. No bueno!  Prices were OK , and the place was clean. One bonus was that they offer Pepsi instead of Coke!  Yay!   Still not coming back though.......
0	2G5QT21mRbarerfNDgg1g	For once I wanted to have lunch at the same time as everyone else and Thai Taste was just packed. This placed just opened up around the corner and I decided to give it a try. I ordered a miso soup and the sauteed veggies with rice.   Service was very good and quick and the miso soup was ok  but beyond that it just ... sucked. Tasteless rice and boiled carrots accompanied greens sauteed in miso. I was hungry but I couldn't eat it most of the plate, it was like hospital food.   Since the miso soup ($1.80) is not included and most dishes are $8 to $11 it's not only tasteless food but an expensive lunch as well. Just what the neighborhood needed, another boring American-Japanese cafeteria.
0	biPVyEZvoOTG78Q8cmoQQw	Best hot dogs in the 'burgh. Extremely creative menu! Loved all the crazy toppings for them! Location is weird, but makes sense with the religious theme. Definitely worth the adventure to find! One of the best lunch spots downtown.
0	CPWOKxzVsXCEEjtms6JzA	Used to be Curve II (yes, there, at one point in time, were 3 "Curve" diners in Madison.  All equally greasy).  Now the new Willaby's.  I was nervous at first.  My experiences at the Willaby's on Willy St. have been defined by sour cream for my coffee.  Would the new location bring new dairy products?  Thankfully, all was in order.  Great food.  Cheap.  Cheerful and pleasant staff.  No wait.  No pretense.  Great food.
0	vypWE7cVO7Nv1sPPX2A	Gave this a place go because of their big grand opening sign out front.  As you walk in, the decor is modern with quite a few more upgrades than the typical Pho restaurant.  The food was okay, nothing special.  Here is a breakdown of what I thought about their Large Pho Ga.      Broth - 2 stars, White pepper overload, and was salty than most places that I have tried.   Chicken - 2 stars,  Not much in there, but the texture was ok.    Noodles - 4 stars, Nice cooked to my desired texture.    Portion - 1 star, portion size was not that big for  large, therefore I was still really hungry after my meal.   My buddy ordered a Pork Chop Rice that looked more filling.  I probably should have ordered that instead.  If I do come back to this restaurant, I will not order Pho, but probably one of their rice dishes.   If you like salty, peppery broth, this place is for you.
0	3ppi4usQGhOH7k02WKEYQ	Tried Metro pizza for the very first time.  The restaurant was busy, so I was sure we were going to get a great pizza for pick up.  We ordered a large pizza with extra cheese and thank goodness we did!   The sauce on the pizza was so overwhelming, in that it was so SWEET.   The extra cheese helped to overcome the sweetness of that sauce.   We weren't used to tasting something so sweet on a pizza.  I don't think we'll try it again.   TOO BAD -- we were really looking forward to a good pizza.
0	PPzj3GykrcKtFYnlqW4qyA	I had lunch here twice and dinner once.   We were looking for something inexpensive and this place fit the bill.   I would have liked some pho but it would involve taking cab rides off the strip.  For lunch, I ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl special which came with a salad and miso soup for $8.99.  Dinner was good.... they had very decent maki rolls (try the playboy roll).  I would return.
0	NI8GjpiXcenHsu67cW6zQ	1st: They tweeted a special 2-for-1 sandwich special. Two from our group ordered, and were then told the special was only during a specific time. Fine, except that the tweet came AFTER that time, and it said COME ON IN.  2nd: The AC uniti or something came one EVERY TIME one of the servers, busboy, manager, etc came out through the door...and it stays on if the door is not closed completely...they on many of the occasion left it just slightly open so the LOUD UNIT stayed on. WE had to close the door.  #3: I was charged EXTRA for the EXTRA SMALL DISH of marinara sauce. No mention that there was a cost.   #4: NO SPECIALS, in fact even though there were 2 kids and 6 adults, three of which were separate, there was an automatic gratuity. 17%+.  AND they leave a spot for another gratuity in case you don't catch it. Good thing someone in the group pointed that out.  #5. The garlic knots were ok.  #6. My server seemed to not care about much, sorry I didn't order a BIG meal, but there was seemed little reason to do so.  #7. We meet once a week on Fridays and are looking for 4 specific place to hang on a regular basis..usually there are 8-12 people that come out...I am not sure I am voting for this place...  #8. Why a I doing this??? You ASKED ME TO.. Yelp it you said.. oh wait. this isn't YELP.. ok then.. guess I will now copy and paste....
0	LECwakkHaPp82WWmDkJKHQ	Good place for families & children who won't eat anything that's not American yet. We laugh at the soap operas on tv that we can't understand. Decent South American food for very reasonable prices. Our last visit wasn't so great, as there were NO margaritas!  Also, the waitresses spent much more time gossiping than waiting on tables. One of our orders was wrong and our food took a very long time as it was sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen for much too long.
0	9hItbdU8Zo8umZ3RlRmnA	Not impressed. Perhaps because I have been able to enjoy Mexican food in the States, where it's closer to the source and probably more authentic. I found Chiquito to be a bit like a Mexican Friday's, with the glossy menu and the focus on expensive alcohol drinks.  I did still want a margarita, which I found to be only reasonably decent. Too much triple sec and ice, not nearly enough tequila. I didn't send it back, but I didn't have another. Still, it was a treat with the chips and salsa. It's the salsa I like - big pieces of tomato with plenty of spicy pepper mixed in. Easy for scooping.  My main - enchiladas with chicken - was served in a crock bowl on a ceramic plate. The bowl was extremely hot of course as was most of the meal. I was therefore unhappy as I ate from the outside towards the center, only to find the center was only warm. I didn't send this back either. The flavor was good, including the small amount of guacamole on top, but that temperature put me off.  I chose not to risk a dessert. In the end, my craving for Mexican was not satisfied. I would not return.
0	DjiQExymmuumtZ7QQLbag	Coming here a few times I quickly learned that this is one of the smaller JImmy John and you should most likely pick up your food and eat somewhere else. The employees were mediocre and so was the sandwich. Not being able to eat pork made ordering a sub pretty hard. Their is a very small selection of only turkey subs, which I hate about the place. I feel that if they included more turkey subs, they would be able to have more business. The place also was pretty packed when I arrived so my friends and I could sit and eat their unless we wanted to wait their for another 20 minutes. Anyways I enojoy the subs their I just wish they had a larger selection of turkey subs and more seating for the customers.
0	8ievg1Vsw1OdnRLiuxqEeg	Well as I noted they changed the menu along with the prices. Some of the items remained intact but other things were swapped out.  For instance you can no longer get pizza until after 4:00. That had been a good take home meal for family. Most items are ala carte but if you order a sandwich you can pair it with chips, fries, or cole slaw. They do have a portabello mushroom sandwich which I will try next time the occasion merits it.  They do offer now a nice spinach salad with toppings and you can add chicken for a slight up charge. Again, this is not a place I normally visit except when I am meeting someone for lunch.  Service can be slow at times.Yesterday we had to wait 15 minutes for our lunch and my girlfriend had to be back at work!  I think their Wi Fi has gotten worse so I normally turn it off to get reception.
0	nvr3d6FxKsJyPiVrSdlSg	A short review:  Want to know what their burgers taste like?  Go to Jack in the Box, and order an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  That's what it tastes like.  The fries are similar to those at Teddy's Bigger Burger.    Disappointing.  In n Out is most certainly better.
0	k1Vcrb8f8Q0Pwj9NzL4aQ	1.5 stars.  I was excited as I rolled off my flight in the D concourse but the service only seemed to be for the carryout option at 9:30 (disappointing) and the take out was pretty crappy.  I've had average sushi before and this joint, while nestled in a hip and fashionable looking section of the concourse, had pretty below-average sushi.  Avoid, especially considering the price.
0	VR94zs69mLLGKAiMMsMfg	3 strikes, sorry Wy-Knot. You're out.  On our first visit, we waited for 30 minutes after placing our order for the food to come out. The place wasn't even crowded that morning. We decided to try again. On our second try, I ordered the Stuffed French toast, a signature dish. After 5 minutes, the owner came out and apologized but they were out of the cinnamon bread to make it. No ingredients to make your famous dish? Amateur. I ordered something else. It was good. After some time, we recently decided to try again. We arrived at 10 minutes till 9, and were seated and our order taken right away. Then the wait. And wait. Then an apology and some complimentary melon. Then finally our food arrived....at 9:45....55 minutes to get served....for breakfast...the quickest cooked meal there is. No owner visit. No explanation. Just slow... For the second time. Too many other choices in town. Sorry WyKnot.  Good food....too slow.
0	FZTPqN5Aq0ULeGFd2shBDg	THIS IS FOR THE LOCATION AT NY NY.  I thought it quite appropriate that my 100th review be about hot dogs.  I can't get enough of them and will eat "dirty water" hot dogs any day of the week.  If you put anything other than spicy mustard and onions, then you're taking away from the true hotdog experience.  I've had my fair share at ballparks and street vendors across the nation.  I have to admit that the vendors on the City's streets are probably the best I've had, specifically the ones around Union Sq since they also serve Pepsi (not all of them do).    But back to Nathan's in Vegas.  I was walking to the Bellagio to meet some friends and realized I was hungry.  I had the coupon for B1G1F and since NY NY was connected to Excalibur, I could walk there with minimal sun exposure.  So I made my way over to have a dog.  When I got there, I was a bit disappointed.  They had spicy mustard, but no onions.  How does a hotdog stand not have onions??  Lack of onions aside, the dog itself was yummy and the bun nice and soft.  Unlike the other locations, the dogs here are fresh since I'm sure they have a higher turnover than the Venetian.    So when you're in the mood for a good hotdog under $2, hit up NY NY.  Rule #1:  Always be sure to go to the location with the highest turnover to ensure a fresh dog.
0	9EbOoT8bmZ169qZav7Q6Gw	Sorry to buck the trend of good reviews as I do agree that the food is yummy and I really want to like this place BUT......  I've been here twice now and the service has been poor-grim. The first time was a sunny spring day when some friends and I popped in for brunch. Yes, I was a little late arriving but we waited an age for the coffees they had ordered and then even longer to for the waiter to take our order. 30mins later (over an hour since we had sat down) we were informed they were no longer doing brunch (even though the same ingredients are on the lunch menu). The manager came and apologised, we had yummy lunch in the sun. Ok, so they're just having a busy shift and training new staff. I'd still come back.  Nope - months later a friend and I decide to try again for a quick brunch. We ordered at the counter before we sat down as we were pressed for time, and turned to feel a few angry eyes from tables who had obviously been waiting a while. Uh oh! Coffees again took an age, despite the staff having no urgency about them at all. They had run out of rolls for my friend's sausage roll so would she take toast? She asked if they had brown bread, answer was 'We have all kinds.     Do you want toast?'. It was all just a bit less pleasant than a weekend brunch should be. I won't be hurrying back to give them a 3rd chance!
0	wu9zfcprUQz3AF77ii02SA	I have been to Culver's before. The food is standard Culver's food. I was there late and was really impressed that the employees were so friendly. The place was clean and I did not feel like I was there with a late night crowd.  This is a stand out location.
0	CfKtln53S9jLZDcBtsVQ2g	Agreed with Susan W.  Disappointing.  It took 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff.  It was the first Thursday of Jazz Festival, however the restaurant was not even close to full capacity, in fact, it only had a few tables when I arrived.  I ordered a Sapporo beer and a Crevettes Cary Rouge (Shrimp - Red Curry).  The sauce was okay, but the dish was average at best.
0	L6YWMdMD9tk6xEBqsuerw	Arrived right at opening so I was anticipating some fresh, piping hot dishes waiting for us (my family) right off the bat. However ...   Some of the dishes looked like it was from the day before, just heated up. Other dishes were pretty tasteless even after adding seasoning.   My dad's only comment was the following: At least the lemon wedges they offer were big slices. He squeezed lemon over a few of the selections to add taste.   The service was awesome. I would hope so as there were less than ten parties in the whole place. Plates were cleared right away and drinks were refilled right quick too.   If I could give a half star, I would have rated this place 2.5 stars because of the excellent service.
0	MyWVH4QH4skrLes3Wciw	What can you say about place that encourages throwing food waste on the floor and allows dogs.  The furnishings are a little awkward.  I felt like I was in some warped combination of Petsmart and a children's play center.  Service was good.  I had the prime rib sliders, they were ok but not good enough to risk having a wind come through and put dog hair in my food.  I had their wheat ale-it was pretty decent.  I doubt I would return, but if someone I knew really really wanted to go there I would go.
0	5Wg1OklKDopgktepibAcw	I went to 1900 Mexican last night.  I have been there several times and keep going back.  The staff are very nice.  There are lots of items on the menu and the food comes out piping hot in a very short amount of time.  I noticed last night that they had kicked up the lighting a bit which helps with the darkly printed menus.  :)  Great neighborhood place!
0	r7iEXHnkvLL1MEBKKjZng	There is no reason to come here. Well, the cafe is good. If you are looking for affordable and good off-hour eats then come here and get your grub on! Other than that, the tables (gambling kind) are kind of a joke and the rooms here... well, stay somewhere else.
0	ON0pEAZrbBMbLPY1TBk0w	A consistently good (albeit a bit pricey for the quality) Italian spot with pretty standard fare.  Though the crowd can sometimes be a bit more dressed up than the food would suggest, we have found it to be relatively kid-friendly ... in our experience the wait staff (which overall comes across more as one you'd find in a franchised setting -- not really 'professional waiters') has responded surprisingly well to the usual needs of a young family (quickly getting kids' food out to the table, checking in frequently, etc).  Lots of seating indoors and out, so pretty easy to get a table when we've gone.
0	Y48bGDrnay4Wnw668G2lvw	I was very excited about visiting Silvi's after reading some good reviews.  I love Mexican food and am always trying to experience new places that have positive buzz.    I have to say I was disappointed by Silvi's. I admit that they are known for the tacos, and maybe I should have ordered them, but I found the food a bit bland and not special. The chips and salsa were good, although not complimentary, and the chips are nice and fluffy. I tried the pork with salsa verde and the beef with red sauce.  Both meats were well-cooked and tender, but the sauces were lacking spice or tang. The pinto beans (not refried) had a nice smoky taste, but when you expect the meats to stand out, it's not that exciting.   We did, however, try the flan, which was nicely presented and very delicious.  I'm not sure if they made it in store as the waitress made a comment about "I saw it the other day", but I could be mistaken.   The service was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  I doubt they'll get a liquor license anytime soon, so you have to bring your own bottle.
0	IKowYzJhf1N0aEn77tQ	I would give the owner and the employees 4 stars for great attitudes and good customer service. However, the pizza is what the review is all about and I can only give 2 stars for the pizza's performance. One of the two pizza's wasn't correct but the owner took care of it immediately. Got us the right pizza pretty quickly & asked us to keep the incorrect pizza. Initially, he had also discounted the pizzas for us which was very exceptional as well. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza, all of them, was that the bottom was so burnt. Just not my bag. Maybe I will try them again another time but for now I will still be keeping my eyes out for a better pie
0	WLaTExk6pTbHvrAUYVcj4Q	If you think China Express is good then this is the place for u. I ordered here based on the 4-star review, and I ended up throwing everything away. You get what you pay for I guess. I ordered soup, Lomein, and chicken and broccoli with brown rice for $17. Everything was terrible and I guess brown rice now means the worst fried rice in history. To the previous reviewers....try Jimmy Wans you will be blown away.
0	GubrCBIy2G7yE87TihVL7g	This was the slowest Steak n' Shake I have ever been to! I waited in the drive-thru line for about twenty five minutes when there were only two cars in front of me. I would have just went inside but I had felt I had already committed and would probably have waited just as long inside.  Once I got to the window the girl did not apologize for the wait or even say hi. Just told me the total and then handed me the bag not even a good bye. I'm not expecting insane service at Steak 'n Shake but an hello and good bye would be nice.  I will say the fries were gold and soggy but that burger with the egg and bacon on top was so good for a fast food burger!
0	yt5YBtgdslBEGY3lC7wbTw	Went for lunch last week...maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cup Another person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$. Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.  On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food
0	ld5kd5WkMBJd8UWcIzgSQ	Ordered pasta with mushrooms, asparagus and a cream sauce for takeaway last night. That's exactly what I got-no salt, pepper, or any herbs/spices/cheese. The worst part was that the asparagus and mushrooms were canned.
0	obrRqmoTMiW1jve5aGwBQA	4 stars because it is near the elevators and you can easily grab a slice as you try to stumble back to your room late at night. I think i had at least one slice a day, as it is pretty good pie for being so cheap. I always got the pepperoni and jalapeno. And as everyone knows, it can be super hard finding ANYTHING cheap in Vegas, so i was happy that i didn't have to end my night with a $30 late night snack.
0	Vz28QJdyP3o5Y8g2sKUEUQ	The LBS Patty Wagon "Perfect Burger" ($7): beef patty topped with gruyere cheese, bacon, oven roasted tomato, frisee, red onion marmalade, LBS sauce and herb mayo. Sounds good, doesn't it? I thought so. In reality, the patty was dry, devoid of any juiciness, thin, hard, and overcooked. It was like one of those nasty burgers from McDonald's (except twice as expensive). The bacon was fatty and undercooked, although I did enjoy the flavor from the red onion marmalade and sauce. With the proliferation of food trucks in the valley, I doubt I'll ever be back.
0	XmxRHvpj0d1NqSI3ooSlsQ	Went for the country sausage potato pancakes. Seemed to have forgotten to put eggs on it. Something just didn't taste right.  My other ordered VIB.  Took awhile.  They only had one cook in the kitchen.  VIB was done and then the pancakes came out. At least they where hot. :).
0	OhWvwGTbiuT4tnLpKiCw	Usually in a sub shop you get to choose your toppings! Not necessarily so here. Went in with a friend. Ordered Club Sub in a tub. Pretty good salad. Also ordered a Cheesesteak. Place was packed with a line heading to the door. Thought that meant good things. Actually meant they move at a snails pace. Got to the register to pay and never saw them start to make the cheesesteak. That's because it was premade, wrapped in foil. 3 times the cashier tried to ring me up for my tub and the sub ordered by the guy behind me in line. That's because she couldn't find my cheesesteak either!  Finally the sub appeared from a shelf or drawer below the counter. When I tried to order fountain drinks I was told "no ice today".  Hmmmm....105 degrees outside.  Ice would have been nice in my drink.  Maybe this was a bad day at JM's.  Might try it again..........might not.
0	nPbZpOE7xa0TWRedZyhng	We still keep going here for our carne asada but the prices have really cut down on the amount we purchase. We've been buying a lot more chicken, it's excellent as well, but when the carne is $1.50 more per pound than it is in CA it's definitely priced too high.
0	qCa2r874RoX1BCStF6SINg	Had dinner there with Wifey last night, never been here before. Very nice dining room, lovely decor, spacious & roomy. Bar looked fun as well. Had some low mein and a spicy chicken dish, asked for brown rice and the waiter brought both brown and white. Nice. Lettuce wraps were OK, not as good as Pei Wei or Flo's. Service was impeccable, just perfect. No 4 star rating because everything was great, just fine, just not that out of the ordinary or spectacular. Kind of on the expensive side as well.
0	BW1hPPYsuzWWS5sBrjxjw	We had a great meal here. I am not sure if it is new owners or what but the place was clean, the food was perfectly prepared and alot of it too.   I had the sampler platter, the pollo fundito was one of the best i have had, filled with white meat, perfect spice to the sauce, the beans were good, the chips and salsa was really good.   We will go back, and judging by the 100's of others there, so will they.   Please try it and let us know.
0	1aWhmlhESfFZI5zkItaEsA	Bungalow doesn't serve up just simply bar food (wings, burgers, etc.). The quaint downtown Scottsdale restaurant and bar, which is more of a bar scene after 8 p.m., features a large menu with offerings like the cajun seared ahi, filet steak salad and turkey, bacon and guacamole wrap (which I highly recommend).  The bar makes a mean martini and boasts a sweet patio that overlooks Scottsdale Road. It's a good place to kick off a night on the town.
0	ZxqA8fpfzX9kTFIX31yrDA	This restaurant was very difficult to find.  I drove all around the Smith's shopping center on W Tropicana Ave/S Hualapai Ave in Las Vegas. It was located between the Subway and a Chinese restaurant.  They have a Facebook page which updates their specials and their closures due to equipment malfunction or family death.  I was planning on going and they just happened to be closed those days.  They are also closed on Mondays.  They had a limited menu.  I ordered the Kalbi Short Rib Plate($10.95) and the Won Ton Min ($8.95) to go.  They offer a Military discount like many of the other Hawaiian restaurants in the area which saved me a few dollars.  The 3 strips of Kalbi was served on a bed of raw shredded cabbage.  There was one large scoop of rice and a partial regular scoop of macaroni salad.  The texture of the macaroni salad was a little grainy, like it was whole wheat.  It was pretty tastless compared to other Hawaiian restaurants.  The Kalbi was grilled medium and was tough and fatty.  The Won Ton Min had about 5-6 won tons.  They were very bland including the broth.  The saimin texture was also a little grainy.  It was garnished with sliced fish cake, char sui, spam, carrots, cooked scrambled egg, and green onions.   I was very disappointed with the food.
0	JScUqr8riftHXYRYzEmadg	I'm worried for this little place that is filled with so many heavenly things.  It is located in the very back of a strip mall littered with furniture stores going out of business.  Go eat @ Don Rafa's.  Everything that we have had is amazing.  The red salsa and guacamole are a little weird but they have a green salsa that is so spicy and accompanies any main entree perfectly.  The staff is totally endearing.  Nothing cookie cutter about this restaurant.  Fresh corn tortillas made on site.  It's delish.  Don Rafa burrito is filled with tender carne and spicy chile's.  Super Sope Pancho is large and in charge.  My husbands favorite.  The taco's are great, the flautas are great, the chips are great, the rice tastes like your great aunts rice (the one you totally love to go home for) Go to Don Rafa.  It won't disappoint.

0	n7OJjWVLeRB4aAbv4xAew	I'm back! is what I proclaimed as I walked through the door. However the longer line just gave me an odd look.  This trip I decided to take my entire team, which ranged from Chinese food pros, to a recent grad from Montana who had to ask me what half of the veggies were.  Overall we had a good trip, our food was good, the service was pleasant and overall it was a good value. Because it was a busy Friday it did take longer for our food to cook than expected. Also we got the last parking spot in the lot, if we were a few minutes later I don't know what we would have done.  I opted for the make you own stir fry with kungpow sauce. I recommend when filling your bowl you skip the broccoli until later as it just takes up excess space at the bottom. I went heavy on the tofu and pea pods this time. The food came nuclear hot so it did take some time for it to cool down enough to eat.  My coworkers were surprised by the volume of food and they seemed to enjoy their shezuan beef and chicken dishes.   I am not the food authority at the office, if some one is going out they now ask me where to go thanks to my recommendation of this place for lunch.
0	3nZ20rCiVrRs5KnUDcgg7A	One of the most disappointing pizzas I have ever had. They tried to over Foo Foo pizza and the flavors just didn't work for me. I should have known to keep walking when they have a GIANT Blue Moon sign in the window and the server tells us they don't serve Blue Moon... Huh?
0	uroe4KH5G7nJCaARGh4BA	Whenever I visit Canada, East Side Mario's tops my list of places to eat, as we don't have them in The States. Unfortunately, this location isn't one of the best.   Italian Wedding Soup and bread are my must-have appetizers. We dined here around 7:30pm and the soup arrived tasting thicker and saltier than normal. The waitress informed us they only had bottom-of-the-pot soup left and would not be making more. We sent the soup back and had salads instead. The bread was piping hot, but took forever to arrive. When we needed a refill, the waitress disappeared for fifteen minutes before bringing more.   Since the soup was a bust, we ordered the spinach dip appetizer with pita bread. This was delicious and devoured quickly. For my main, I had Spaghetti Primavera with shrimp. A beautiful array of vegetables mixed in with the pasta provided me with both dinner plus leftovers for lunch the next day.  While my main was delicious, the slow service (we were one of four tables) combined with the soup incident gave me no choice but to bump this down to two stars.
0	nWWWmhgypIYKGUpIRFvZQ	I like this place. There usually aren't any screaming kids bothering me. Also, they have old computers that people can use to do useful things, like search the internet and write yelp reviews expressing their valid and not-so-valid opinions.
0	XZDHUYMtQCnCpYAiNZchw	I have been to many different Panda Express locations.  Some in malls, some drive thru, some walk up.  I have found the food to be pretty consistant and decent.  It was about 5:30 on a Saturday evening and I had just finished running some errands.  I saw the Panda Express and thought that would be a good option since I have been experiencing a medical issue and I am not supposed to be on my feet for too long.  I pulled in and took a quick glace at my options.  When the server came up to take my order she acted as if she could care less.  I asked for string bean chicken but upon close look it appeared as if it had been sitting there for most of the afternoon.  I said to her "those beans do not look good"  Her response was "do you still want it?"  Really??  No, no and no!  I got the broccoli beef instead but it was not much better upon tasting it when I got home.  I also got the honey walnut shrimp. The coating was rubbery, not crisp, which would indicate to me that most of the food had been sitting around for some time.  The server should have asked if I would like to wait while they made a fresh batch.  That would have been good customer service.  Instead she got my order together, rang it up, and that was that. No thank you or anything.  And there was one other person being waited on while I was there.  It was not as if they were swamped with people.  Sorry but I'm not sure I will be going back to this particular location.  There are others near me that have done a far better job.  Management needs to do a check on their employees and refresh their memories as to what good customer service really is and how to achieve that.  I also gave them my opinion since they offer a free entree for filling out their survey online.  Hopefully someone will get the point.
0	y1Wk3w7kc9fWbiDxbyDtw	We used to come here late at night after work and we'd order pizza and have a couple of beers. It was amazingly good 2-3 months back but today we ordered the same topping since and it just tasted bland! It wasn't the topping. The sauce may to have seem bland. It used to be great. We just hope it'll be better next time.
0	QW7AJJ2otQx2iTMu2J0MA	Just got back from having lunch at Pio Pio.  I was excited to have some Lomo Saltado for lunch and I headed to Pio Pio for the first time since it got good reviews on Yelp.  I try to be fair with my reviews and I'll do the same here......  I was very disappointed with my experience at Pio Pio today.  Upon arriving a little before Noon, I noticed there was only one big party of at least 10 people seated.  A waiter showed me to my seat and quickly got my drink and took my order.  The place is clean and pretty nice.  The waiter brought out two dipping sauces.  One was pretty spicy and the other was a little milder.  I liked them both, so it was cool.  Shortly thereafter, my favorite Peruvian dish was brought out, Lomo Saltado!!  Man, I love this dish!!  At least the one I used to get at Misti's in Port Chester, NY.    Simply put..... The dish is made up of fries, rice (usually white, but they served it yellow) topped with beef strips sauteed in onions and tomato.  The problem with the dish is that it was literally tasteless!!  I mean, I poured some salt and pepper on it and it simply tasted like.................. nothing.  I poured some of the dipping sauces and this at least added some heat to the dish.  I was very dissapointed to say the least.  I don't compare it to what I used to get in NY because I know every restaurant uses different seasoning, but c'mon man!!  :).  I will give this place another try though..... I know Peruvian Pollo a la Brasa is very good, so I will eventually go back and try their chicken, but I don't plan on ever getting the Lomo Saltado again.
0	udbujPkWH9KvmFOE7t8cQ	They have the worst spring rolls for 100 miles in any direction!  Dry - taste like frozen baked.  Just awful.  The dishes were very disappointing all around.  Just sorry we went for the all you can eat - so not worth it.  If you are looking for d\u00e9cor - nice, fancy, clean.  The food? Ugh.  Oh and did I mention that most of our food arrived barely lukewarm?  Seriously.  I complained to the waiter who did nothing about it.  They were not busy in fact they were almost empty and no surprise! The pumpkin coconut soup at $5.00 - don't bother.  I've had delicious pumpkin soup - Their soup isn't worth trying.
0	kop35OGnVAknGiNBXLorOg	This is a 2.5 star review. Bistro tex-mex. Ain't it grand?  The booths are comfy, the interior is chill and low-light, service varies from great to distracted, and the menu is huge (including a large-ish Veg selection, plus their open-mindedness about subs and alterations). But being as huge a fan of the mexican flavor set as I am, it hurts my soul to see it bandied about, willy-nilly. At least they aren't claiming to be "authentic", as some other high-end places in this town declare - Mexican inspired is pretty accurate.  So I get my order of veggie enchiladas with tomatillo salsa and, although its interesting, there's so much happening in my mouth that with every bite, I'm scratching my head a little harder. To start, they use the same veg mix in all their vegetarian dishes - a finely shredded mix of shrooms, zuch, sweet plantains, pepper. Corn, even. Things are cooked down to an unrecognizable pile of whatever. Too sweet. Pair that with a very carefully opposite of hot green sauce and super mild queso fresco, and you've got the idea - there's no bright, interesting ooomph to tie the dish together, and it needs it, badly.  Other stuff I've had makes me think I'm eating a Big Mac (yeah, its been a while, but still)- the plantain side "salad" is too much, too sweet, 15 flavors all at once that collide and become gastronomic mush. There's sugar, or sweetening agents, in so many things here. Rice, even. Sheesh.  They did make me a torta con huevos y queso, no arguments, although it wasn't on the menu. It was tasty and messy - reminded me of Chicago style rather than NY.   The salsa is bland, but the chips are perfect. They have a jalapeno margarita (6$) that is probably the spiciest thing on the menu (but isn't, really).
0	yTSFBWBi0IJ2E202Hrag	Great portion size for a reasonable price, and the food was good too. The service was as good as I could expect considering there were only two waitresses and the manager available during a rush. They also put up with a very disrespectful couple a lot better than I would have, so kudos to this Tres Pesos.
0	x7OmVluriGa9DozywQWXLw	Stuck us old fat people in a corner and tried to forget about us! No biscuits with the salad bar, but the menu states that it comes with! Waitress waited on the four young guys that came in behind us. Only ever saw our waitress twice. Never asked if we wanted a refill either! Hubby thought things were fine, not me. Don't think you should gave to wait 10 just to see a waitress and get your order in!
0	aIFsk6saJocAFnXnWJmRg	This is definitely worth trying out. My first time for breakfast. Adela was friendly.  The omlette was good and the food cooked with competence.  The prices are amazingly affordable.  And they have TV for the sports fans.
0	SV3MW18yojnBv56cwbZxg	I had a Groupon voucher for this restaurant, and I went with my husband. I thought the burger was okay, but my husband was not happy. The bun is almost three times the size of the patty. The toppings? Most of them are actually sauces, not toppings.   If we had to choose between Cheeburger Cheeburger or Harvey's, we'd pick Harvey's. Cheeburger was also pretty expensive. We got nothing extra at all, not even a beverage and it was still about $25.00.   We were placed right by the door and it was freezing each time someone opened the door to come in or leave (although it wasn't all that busy).   Not a great experience and we won't go back again. Sorry Cheeburger Cheeburger!
0	rdddS9pFFHO7vRo5OtZGCA	4 star - 5 star!  Pretty good place! I like this one more than the one cross street (base on how they cook).... BUT how come they only have ONE ppl working on Sat night, which is a busiest time?! Curious.. I feel sorry to bother him since he has to welcome customers, clean table, order, runing back and front.... sigh.... sorry man! But I'm hungry too ...... :(  very hard to make decision!   I have 'hot' seafood tohu ----- yummy yummy!
0	k3QhZL5UbkoghZ3dKdzLTw	I ordered the breakfast bowl with Applewood bacon and queso. I asked for no salsa, which they accommodated me on that. However, their chilaquilas (an ingredient in my bowl) is really enchilada sauce. In what world are those two the same thing? Chilaquilas is eggs, nacho chip strips, ranchero sauce and cheese. Since they soaked all of the chips in this enchilada sauce, the whole thin tasted horrible. The bacon was in whole slices rather than broken up - doesn't make sense for eating a bowl. They used green olives which I've NEVER had on Mexican food. I hate green olives and would have asked which kind they were had I thought they might something other than the traditional black olives. My husband did not like his breakfast tacos either. The only reason they are getting two stars is we've had good quesadillas here before.
0	kemPK6WnpptLUqDbm3eikA	I had dinner here this evening (Tuesday July 9, 2013).  I had cold wings and warm beer.  I mentioned my issues to the manager on the way out and he acted like I was asking him the square root of a made up number.  To add insult to injury, my boneless wings were less like wings, or even nuggets, more like crumbs and they cost $8!!!
0	AT5Vy7jTYoBd4hkXLL7rtw	Love this place , eat here when I'm trying to low carb it, sometimes twice a week. Usually we order 50 wings , celery sticks 3 blue cheese dressings 2 reg drinks around $40 , which I think is a great deal. We like the Cajun , teriyaki, lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. Minimum wait is 15 min if there not busy little longer if busy because they cook to order. Wing come out nice and hot. Pretty consistant . Only complaint they need   more sauce selections a Thai peanut sauce would b good.
0	raktN0p7NA9dbHgdrvAItA	VIVA LAS VEGAS!!  after hearing so much about this steakhouse, my gf's and i had to give it a try last year during a bachelorette party.  it's the place to see and be seen.  due to the sheer size our party, we took advantage of the special the restaurant offers for bachelorette parties - we sat around the circular bar (smack dab in the middle of the restaurant).  $75-$100 a head gets you a great meal w/ champagne toast and VIP entrance into RAIN.  the steaks were great and just melts in your mouth.    ***the stars LOVE this place...just as we were entering the restaurant, we ran into the husbands to the "desperate housewives".  also dining there that night was dule hill & wife (of west wing fame).  mind you, this was only around 7:30PM...you can only imagine the madhouse it would have been later on in the night.***  eye candy for both the guys and gals...be careful, your food may get cold if you're too busy checking out who's at the bar (hehe)!
0	66RoiC4F3tDqdLSi6C1zg	I love this place.  My boyfriend & I went in on a whim and really enjoyed it.  I think we go at off times, because it's usually pretty empty (Sunday early afternoon).  I don't know what it is about their sauces, but they absolutely rock!  Try ordering the Penaso Burito (not sure if that's really the name).  It has machaca and this great spicy, creamy sauce... LOVE it.  Last weekend we tried another new one also from their specialties.  WOW!  I love this place & look forward to trying their Wednesday taco bars.
0	IvNdOX4kASYE0b1lethTg	I have been meaning to try this place. The menu seems pretty interesting. I walked in, at a time, when I thought it wasn't too busy. I was wrong. I guess they had some big catering going on, and they seemed to be racing against time. Working in the F&B industry, I understand. I ordered a Calzone with applewood smoked bacon and spinach. Also, the one thing that caught my attention, Rosemary and garlic Knot bread. with their ranch, that had a hint of rosemary spice to it, best part of the meal. Great flavor, they say that they use a natural leavening dough, meaning everything is natural even the yeast, takes longer to cook, longer to proof, had a sourdough taste to it. Great appetizer. Next, to the Calzone, it was average. I don't know what it was but nothing stood out. I've had different types of ricotta. This one was not appetizing at all. Dough was a little undercooked. I am not sure if it's just my personal preference but I wasn't a big fan of their dough, as other yelper's are stating that they have really good pizza dough. Maybe I am just so used to instant yeast and high-gluten flour, that I maybe missing something. anyways,  What saved it was the mozzarella and the other toppings. Great portion with the sauce, and bonus points for using Cristofer Columbo tomatoes. Great product, as I have used those in the past. I might try some other things here in the near future, maybe a slice next time. Service was kind of slow, but like I said It seemed like they were busy in the back.
0	IeiVa8f1sqsAGqBRRuVVw	Okay, we went to the Jazz & Wine series and they promoted this place as new. My wife ordered the Margherita Pizza and complained it was not good. she didn't think they used the right sauce on the pizza and couldn't find any basil on it. My pepperoni pizza was average. The crust had the texture of and tasted like it was a store bought frozen crust.  I should have known as they serve Pepsi, and I am a Coke drinker.  One good thing is their selection of beer was excellent.  Had the Purple Haze from Abita Springs Louisiana. And, it was a nice view for the sunset.  But for Pizza, I'll go across the street to Ciba e Vino.
0	EF2DLsJVIQ8KrBff8mZtIw	OK, this is--THE NEW SPOT!!!-- Really 4.75 stars!!!   They have lunch a specials-1/2 off menu for sushi... Mon-Sat. before 3pm.  The Mexican Roll is a new favorite of myself and the husband!!!! It comes on wantons, no rice... its spicy tuna, onion, mango, jalape\u00f1os and im sure a few other things! Its absolutely AMAZING!!! I didnt think i would like it, that was until i saw someone else order it asked what it was and then tried it... OMG, thats all i can say! The Superman Roll is just amazing also!!! (our favorite by far and we save it for last)   They have great Nigiri as well!!!! The Salmon literally melts in your mouth, the garlic tuna is wonderful, the super white tuna, great!!! They have very high quality fresh fish! I just cant say enough good about this place!!!  And and and... If you go there enough you get your very own set of special chopsticks with your name on them that you get to store there, pick up when you come in, use and they wash and keep them there for you for next time your in!! We got ours today!!!!!!! :) I cant wait to go back and use them! Next time i am going to try the Salmon-Bomb!! Which i noticed once i was too full this time!

We ate a LOT, and i mean a LOT of stuff... like 6 orders of Nigiri and 2 orders of Mexican Roll, a Superman Roll (not on special, so it was $15) and like 3 other rolls as well........ $65 total/tax incl. Not bad at all!  SushiWa, I thank you for coming into my life just when i needed you..... I was just saying to the husband today when we were leaving that we would have to bring Brian (from the Ka) with us to SushiWa so we could see him and hang out and not have to go to the "awful Ka" ...... just a thought?!??
0	aGivyyIF0VNIC4XyIkgpQg	My native Las Vegas (Las Vegan?) friends said that Origin India was one of the best indian places in Vegas.  And as a whole they were correct.  The food was quite good.  I'm not up on my Indian food names, but I can tell you that we got a lamb dish, a chicken dish, a potato and spinach dish and lots of lentils and naan.  They were all quite tasty though the lamb dish was no where near being as spicy as we requested.    For the price, I thought the food was just so-so, but I'll give it an extra star for being the "Best in Las Vegas."  The wines were reasonably priced.  The waiter could NOT grasp the concept that we wanted to share everything, which made ordering overly complicated.    A DJ started playing right when we got there and though the music was pretty cool (techno Indian music and live bongo drums...seriously, it was pretty cool), it was pretty loud and we had to scream and repeat ourselves to uphold our conversation.  Overall a good place, but I can't wait to get some SF dive Indian food.
0	6EAs4tbaPRlYTjRnKfbeQ	Food is average, not the best, not the worst.  Promptly seated, chips, salsa, drink order taken right away.  Two different visits, two different servers, months agpart - both forgot to place 1 of the 2 orders that my party of 2 placed.  Not overly busy either time during lunch, so really no excuse for it.
0	uapM2IHfgk46fHhb5wOHQ	My wife and I went here for our 10 year anniversary at the recommendation of my pops.  Said it's a "reasonable" Italian place with great food.  I don't know what planet he's on, but reasonable is not the first thing that comes to mind... it is a high ticket place... min. plate is $40... wine list starts at $50 a bottle... plus $50 corkage fee.  My Makers Mark on the rocks was a $19 drink.  With that said, that was some good Italian food.  The service was amazing, the ambiance was bang up good... and to boot there was a guy railing on Harry Reid at the table next.  Excellent!  My advice, "getter dun", but come packing some cash.
0	aqhgnKBRRvVFoD0BmTP4w	Pros - inexpensive, large portions, the cheese puffs or crab ragoon as we call them at home were awesome!! If I go back, that's the only thing I'll order.  These rice was not edible....  Cons - food was so/so; just average.  It was quick and easy.
0	eOeCa4PpMHYovCTtkJL9g	I know it's weird reviewing Burger King but I just had to let people know about my experience. The staff at this place are pretty amazing for a fast food joint. I usually eat at in n out or smash burger but I was at a loose end. The burger was fine as were the fries which would normally be a 3 star but I had an emergency, needed a charger for my phone. Of course nobody has one but they all scrambled and came back with a charger from a neighboring business- so kudos to the team.
0	oUibUCmscGT4THnLivvOw	Pros: JAMAICAN FOOD! Pretty good meat pies/patties. Has advertisements and fliers for other Jamaican/Caribbean related businesses and events in Vegas.  Cons: Kind of steep(but understandable). Jerk chicken is a bit dry sometimes.  Yay for Jamaican food. I really wish Vegas had more offerings of Jamaican/Caribbean culture.
0	o4DF5CyrvyemjgIuFXmjAQ	I like the ambiance of this place...it's pretty and trendy but not too loud. The food and service are really good. THE BEST DESSERT is the Bars of Sin. It is worth going to the restaurant, if just to eat that! PROMISE.
0	WOzAI7q84LfhlhSCacILVA	I really question the quality of their caviar. It's black salty fish eggs alright, just not sure what kind of fish did they come out from.  But having lobsters for breakfast is a cholesterol high all in itself!
0	ZbNq69abeTptSEBLiCS0A	We came in tonight because my boyfriend was craving some Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and because another Hawaiian restaurant (that's closer to us) was closed today.  Though their prices are reasonable and the portions are plenty, the food was just so-so. We both got BBQ Chicken plates which came with macaroni salad and free fountain drinks (which was cool). The chicken was tender, but lacking some flavor. So, it was better dipped into the teriyaki sauce they provided. The mac salad was bland and you could only taste (and see) how much mayo was in it.  We've been here once before and always believe in trying a place a second time (just in case their kitchen was having an off day). However, their food hasn't changed much and I don't foresee us coming back anytime soon.
0	p5tYUfjgUIKlNqC4x4aJg	my mother and i were very disapointed with just about every thing.The salad bar had very little choices and the soup was luke warm.I am not that picky when it comes to a buffet, but when it comes to cold shrimp,and cold chicken wings, and sticky floors at ten bucks for dinner, and drinks are extra i wont be back.
0	qsfMAg0UY0cAY9s8YCE9w	I will be honest   The food was just ok been to plenty of Italian restaurants and this lace serves small portions and the service was pretty bad we never got a water refilled and for a so called home made pasta place it just doesn't cut it ,,,for around 18'.00 a plate which isn't high it should either fill you upor at least tantalize your taste buds ,,,it did neither,,,my stepson had lasagne which tasted an looked like some version of a Mac and cheese dish...won't be back went on jan 3 2013
0	3BDEOgErxYaZAVEfsqCouQ	This place is Pho Ao Sen with a new name, a menu redesign and less taste. I used to consider Pho Ao Sen my number 2 go to for Pho due to it's quality and proximity to me. Now I probably won't be back. The Pho Tai Chin I had seemed to lack any substantial flavor in the broth, my key to some good pho, and the meat just seemed sub par. It used to be the broth was solid but not great, now it is below the curve.   I wanted them to still be at least decent for those times when for some reason I need some pho when UnPhoGettable (best pho I have had so far) is closed. Now I probably won't be back, with the number of places to get pho expanding this place is getting bumped from my list.
0	hZkhVIy0zP8pnO536KQpTA	I'd walked by Lucca for YEARS before finally deciding to pull the trigger and dine here (as part of my eternal quest for delicious Italian food).  I had an Enjoy book coupon so I figured, why not?  I love this restaurant and if you haven't dined here, you've got to try it out!  I've been to Lucca for relaxed dinner with friends, business meetings, and romantic dates and somehow Lucca has the right atmosphere for all three occasions.  If you come here in the summer, they have a really nice patio.  If you're eating inside, its still got a really nice ambiance.    The food is excellent and I do not even care if I look foolish when I flip out over the meatballs the way I do.  Oh my god they are so good.  I recommend the ravioli, and the pizza!  I've never had a bad meal here.  Holy crap the scallops... they are soo very good!    Lucca is not the cheapest place you can dine, but it's not dreadfully expensive and I've actually paid a lot more for food that was nowhere near as good.
0	Ug0nGIveNnbSGwlhoErijw	OFF DAY? They were profusely apologetic for the comedy of errors with our order and bill. They were just as apologetic to the other couple - and the people on the phone who were not happy with their delivery. Once the new staff gets trained, hopefully things will be smoother. The food was a tad salty when it finally arrived.
0	ulLIK0fWZZ6FvvyoQ1v50Q	Friendly help, fast service, many choices--too many actually--jack of all asian trades, master of none, so to speak.    I get nervous ordering raw fish  from any restaurant with a dirty floor and filthy windows.  Prices match other places with table service and non plastic utensils--so why not have a better experience? Oil may not have been hot enough, got quite the tummyache afterward from the grease of the tempura.  The takeout options seem to appeal to the young crowd.
0	bW5Tm3OMBc86YyaoyjgMQ	I agree with everyone's reviews.  Even the drive through is slow.  It isn't the greatest location but I do have hopes that they plan to upgrade the location.  There isn't many choices in buckeye for food add it is
0	9e40a0bfU5iVli9bMsLDCg	Wow great place to eat just came home from dinner.  I've been meaning to try this place for a couple of months now, and finally decided to check it with a friend.  Good atmosphere not noisy at all and a great place for good sushi and a good talk.  Fish quality was good and service was excellent.  Will definitely be back to try the different rolls.  Had the New York, Volcano, and Red Spider alll very tasty
0	SM9h5dBAABlfCHzfEQR6Q	If you like Filipino food you should try this place.  I ate here several times while I was in Chandler. There are so many dishes that are good here and I don't even know the names of most of them.  What I did, once I saw how it was, was to go in after 6pm when they put almost everything on half price to move it out before they close and I just pointed to about 4 or 5 dishes like I was going thru a buffet line and get the smallest container of each item (except the pancit which I really love and get a bigger size of) and took it all home and eat it for the next 3 or 4 meals.  The chicken and pork were both good.  This is not low-calorie stuff so be forewarned it will fill you up!
0	osqJzTV1dftjSgpZliWCFg	I had dinner here last night with my Bulgarian friend. The food was very good and reasonably priced. We started with a shopska salad - diced cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and olives covered with Bulgarian feta cheese. Our next dish was fried zucchinis smothered with yogurt and dill. Our last dish was the shopsky style cheese - cheese, egg, and sundried tomatoes baked in a gyuvech (sp?), a small earthenware style pot. Of course we couldn't leave without trying grappa, and honestly I took about three sips of mine before realizing that it might not be a good idea to drive home should I continue to drink more of it. All of the food was delicious, and I remember seeing a bunch of other things on the menu that I would love to go back and try.  The bill came to a total of about $29, which surprised me as I was expecting to pay much more. I would definitely return, but I'm not sure if I would go without my Bulgarian friend. While the service was good and the staff was friendly, I was the only non-Bulgarian dining there that evening and I feel like I would stick out if I went without my friend.
0	nkZj1MeZA5nVMqMc0JVD7Q	Maybe I just had bad service or caught a bum deal, I don't know but either way I probably won't be going back.   Stopped in there to grab some appetizers and have a meeting with a friend. Ordered the cheese wedges and the crab cakes.   We took two bites of the crab cakes, one for me and one for him. They were soggy and really terrible. I love crab cakes and these were only shaped like them. The waitress came by to the bring the check and asked if we wanted her to mention it to the manager, I said "yeah that'd be great, they're just really soggy and not good" She came back a minute or so later with "The manager says that's just how they are. Here's your change"  Not impressed.
0	u32dWdJ7JOnBnzQRnqF9Tg	The restaurant looks nice enough.  The food, unfortunately is not good. The ahi tuna had been frozen and was very bland. The risotto was the AWFUL. I couldnt eat it.  We had a coupon for 50 bucks worth of food and it took them until after we ate to know if they were going to honor it or not.
0	MTOq040mNcIsGdBcOgVTfQ	Walked in 10 minutes to close and was told by the manager that they were closing soon and that they needed to kick everyone out then. He said "you can order food if you want, but you won't be able to eat it here." Thanks, we won't eat there. Congrats on getting out of there on time.
0	5JuH9ctcZk7V4ESdsOz3Q	UIUC has several "in-campus" dining options ranging from the Illini Ballroom to the fast food restaurants in the basement of the Union. Bevier is run by food science students, which may sound shady, but we do happen to have one of the best food science departments in the country and there is an actual chef who helps out. The menus vary from day to day and can be found on the website. Nearly everything I've tried at Bevier has been good, except a "test kitchen" dessert I evaluated.  Ingredient quality is superior and I know they purchase some local/organic ingredients. I've found their flavorings to be unique and delicious as well. Prices are reasonable and can be found on the website. For such an tucked away location, it usually is crowded by professors and students during lunch time, but the clientele is typically older. The cafe itself was recently renovated and now it's quite nice inside. It's a great place to get lunch if you are on that side of campus.
0	1Yunqs6UiZbYTFvFvqdOw	Some of the unhealthiest food you'll eat, but man is it good!  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The prices are pretty fair considering how filling the food is.  The best part about the place it that it defies what you think a burrito stand will be.  It is, without a doubt, the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  It has an open kitchen so you can see how everything sparkles.  The floors are spotless and,after a long night of drinking, I'd be totally cool with eating off of them.
0	gcPcnx2Yi6cPy0iNkvJJAw	I love Culvers because it reminds me of home.  The food is usually very good and who can say anything bad about Custard.    My problem is with Culvers all over the Valley and not just this one. Employees, when you are at work, please be at work.  The last three times I have been at Culvers, I know the employees would rather be anywhere else than where they were. They have not listened to me, they constantly ask again and again what I want, they get interrupted by other employees which takes them back to square 1 cause they forget what they were doing.  Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.  One of the employees had never run the register before, and he was interrupted several times.  Of course my order was not correct, even after starting over 3 times to get it right.  The kid was trying, he just didnt have the training to be where he was.   Just a poor way to run a register.  I can get a burger anywhere, and probably will from now on.  Custard is making its appearance in Phoenix finally and I will have other places to go for that also.  Culvers Management, your employees need training.  They need to know that when they are working, they need to be with the Customer, treat us with respect, LISTEN TO US, and get our orders right.  Get this message out, your employees, this is not a part time job after school and you do not have to work hard.  Culvers has a good reputation all over the US.  People in Phoenix/Scottsdale can shop anywhere for food like this.  Make the experience pleasant and memorable for the right reasons and people will come back.  When they come back, you will continue to have a job.  I have no reason to come back now until it gets hot and custard is on my mind.   Give me a reason to come back for other things....
0	nwXXHvIsMWaWHiRYmW8TA	OK, let me break it down for you, dawg:  - Great gourmet dinner.  Lots of little touches and unique offerings.  We went with the prix fixe offering, and weren't disappointed.  It included a swordfish involtini, a great eggplant dish, and a wonderful lamb dish with a crust of several nuts.  The lamb was outstanding.  - Service was very good, though perhaps a bit snooty.  - Wine list.  Probably the best we've ever seen...it is a Grand Award winner from Wine Spectator.  We're talking a tome for the wine list, and this includes a choice of several vintages of the same wine.  That's really quite impressive.  - Way pricey.  Ok, it is Vegas.  However, there are other fantastic places on the strip where you may be able to get a comparable meal for $100 less.  - Ambience.  I would say it was nice and intimate, but not super memorable.  For a Vegas restaurant, it probably actually falls short.  - Overall.  Yeah, a definitely positive experience.  Overprices for the overall experience, but still great nonetheless.  If you are a wine hound and have the time for a lengthy dining experience, you may enjoy this restaurant a lot.
0	5AkHPu5KHvSZ51HdKtZklQ	After reading a glowing report in the RJ, we gave it a try. Went to the Serene location inside Doc Holidays Saloon.  Food was great, but service was lousy. The server was nice but she didnt refill our drinks or check on us ( at one point we were the only customers...)   Place was a bit dirty and smokey.  While the food was good,  everything else was not.  Whover is managing the place needs to work harder.  Too many better places to go, especially in that area.
0	duEQCbVCishQRX901oQwQ	Great food. And though I'm not usually a fan of chocolate, the chocolate souffle was to die for! The view is wonderful, the service was great. Not the very best Las Vegas has to offer, but still mighty fine!
0	6cGA2TMWwoTbLzsMhnGMg	I used to visit U of I a lot in my previous life. For a college town, this place has the best Korean food, probably within the proximity of 200 miles. The rice and soup can be refilled. The price is reasonable. What more can you ask for when you're a cheap college bastard? SRSLY!
0	lVdmJGrvqQeioCREdEMOyw	The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!   Edamame was perfectly steamed  Sushi was tasty  Salmon Teriyaki was delicious  sake and kirin washed it all down  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.
0	vOBcGlqILMJSTRDwXzy0g	My fiance and I have been here a couple of times. White tablecloths and a quiet, comfortable atmosphere--with jazz music playing in the background. They have an interesting menu, including Chinese and Thai food, and tasty appetizers. This is a nice place to sit down, relax, and enjoy.  We were well served and our food was delicious--both times. The house salad is simple but has a nice ginger dressing.
0	VulfnIWNNc1WAXWtagWs3Q	I'd say this was an upscale version of Arbys if the sandwiches were actually better than Arbys.  Somehow, they fail to cross even that low barrier.  The French Dip isn't bad, though it is bland, but the FOB is a horrible, horrible sandwich.  Lukewarm bad roast beef served in a noxious sauce that turns the whole thing cold and soggy.  Somehow they manage to serve this monstrosity (with fries and a drink) for over $10.  To top it off, the service is inexplicably slow and everyone who works there looks like they're about to fall asleep.     Perhaps Full of Bull wouldn't be so offensive if it wasn't right across the street from Roast Public House, which is certainly the best sandwich place on State Street and probably the best restaurant.    I'll give them a one-star bump for not allowing the place to become homeless headquarters like KFC/taco bell used to do.
0	co1YzcZH1KY8GmFPPJLiw	The food is good, that's for sure, but I look for a full experience - food, atmosphere and service, and the other two were lacking.   We liked that there was fun 80s music playing, but we were awkwardly squeezed into a middle table where we were constantly in the waiter's way and a bit too close to tables next to us. The service is almost too fast to enjoy the experience of eating out - the food came only 5-10 minutes after ordering. (When I called to make a reservation, they told me we would have 2 hours - I think we were there about 45-minutes).  Lastly, the waiter looked like me like I was an alien whenever I asked a question/request, such as: "Can I please have a knife?" Apparently, that's an odd request, even when you have a huge chicken breast to eat. It was just odd service.   In the end, there are places I can go that have good food, atmosphere and service, so I wouldn't choose Le Boucan again.
0	i2KDWDdnexMAl5tw3yXxSA	This place is what it is (an expression I loathe, yet it's so fitting in this case). Other Yelpers comment that Mardis Gras isn't sure what it wants to be. Maybe that's why I like it. It's not trying to be anything other than a place for people to come together and have a few drinks. The bartenders are nice and astute so they won't let you go thirsty. The owners are always there and they are real friendly and nice.  The food here is surprisingly good! You wouldn't think it but it's awesome. I'd even go out on a limb and say that the fries are better than McDonalds!  The place has a stage for live acts. My brother's band has played here with no problems and the sound system was awesome. Comedians come through here, too. There is a pool table, beer pong table, darts, Golden Tee, etc. There are TV's to catch the game.  Karaoke nights are great here as well. There's always a good mixture of people and nobody cares what kind of song you do. The KJ Shawn has a great selection of songs.  If you're in the area stop on by. Come witness the un-snooty side of Scottsdale.
0	e4LeYCyQBQS7UlA8z1qg	Need a Vegas institution? This is it! The pepper mill is one of those places that's on the hipster places one must visit in Vegas that's off the beaten path etc etc. I guess to some extent it still is, but it is by no means unknown or under the radar. The prices at the Pepper mill reflect the coolness of the old school here.  Why four stars? Because silly, when have I ever reviewed something that wasn't worth the price. I don't think that one should go down here for a full meal, it is really expensive and for not AMAZING food. But go with your other, and fully make out by the fire as you watch Good Charlotte on the little LCD TVs that the CRAZILY added. So go, order a ten dollar drink and enjoy the old schoolness that is the Pepper mill.
0	fn12mPlofDJxQi82fqTijg	This is a great place to get pretty good seafood in a Mid-Western town.  I'd say it's similar to Red Lobster, but better in nearly every way.  They recently changed their menu, but I know the previous menu provided lots of food for a reasonable price.  Really great clam chowder.
0	B41U2eLXtHzxEoDqWaaZ2A	When I worked down in Tempe we often used to come here for lunch. Between the group of us we have sampled numerous selections from the menu and it has all been good to excellent.  The atmosphere is also good and the staff are friendly, making it one of my favorite Tempe lunch spots.
0	PliBgDlUKWxQKLsDcIDKg	Came here on a Saturday night at 1am. Music wasn't that loud, and the seats were 90% empty.   Waaaay back in my early Yelp days, I had reviewed this establishment under previous ownership. In a past life, this bar would have been PACKED, and had a really cool clientele. Sure, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is still cool, but the crowd had been reduced to a row of lonely looking women just pecking away at their phones waiting for something to happen that never does.  The net cafe around the corner seemed to house more excitement. Daddy O's was THAT boring.
0	1R366T6QfUeqhOrNaUBkXg	This is a great place to eat at before you go to a play at the Benedum. It's ideal for a small group as the place is small and very busy before plays. If you can, I reccomend making reservations beforehand.
0	Q19ajd5NSGykhAZSRGj6A	This place is a sleeper. It's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale but has a very unique vibe. Lotsa tequila, which can be a very good or very bad thing, as we all know, but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix. People seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables, never so much in what looks to be the dining area.   The bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley, but with that much booze and Corona floating around that's bound to happen. Food is so/so, but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out.
0	aX6IrPiKDHcO1UWkkwBg	Fastest place to grab some hot food near the C gates at CLT airport but it's pretty subpar pizza. Also watch out there's two different prices for pizza - one for normal and one for specialty. Either way it's going to be $4.50-$5.50 for a slice which is pricey for the taste and quality.
0	DqYVwuKFJUyacX5IrToQ	Yep, be prepare to wait.  Our dinner reservation was at 9:30pm but didn't get in till like 40 min. after.  Once we get in, it's worth it in my opinion, the food was delievered shortly after we place the order.  The track playing inside were so cool that one of my friend decide to buy the CD off them.  There were 5 guy of us that we each order a dish & there was plenty to share, all reasonable priced.  My favorite got to be their cooked Samon on the menu, just a bit suprise me, really good dish!  Lastly, the decor was really amazing they got this giant budda statue at first floor, there was some birthday party next to us that there were a guy working there hitting the traditional Japanese drum to celebrate for them, really cool.   Oh & if you're lucky like us to get in to the club afterward, the waitress stops by your table to take u upstair personally, which consider the crazy, busy amount of people they have, I have to say they did a really good job.  Just try it yourself, you won't be disappoint doing both the dinner & the clubbing there, in my opinion.
0	nXmUcpkg7bNAwrdqbhYAg	Great place for happy hour 5-7pm daily. Ordered a friggin huge man cup of beer (domestic - 32 ounces) for 4 bucks! All the appetizers were $5 bucks including the stuffed mushroom. The flavor on the mushroom which is a bit strong but presentation and flavor was awesome for 5 dolla meal. 4 stars for feelin buzzed and full under $10 bucks. Def. worth it.
0	cZD1qmGwHz1MtWgd3Mbg	I had dinner at Leroy Fox tonight.  This site used to house the old Hotel Charlotte.  The rennovation was very impressive.  The restaurant was very nice and it was good to see that they had incorporated parts of the old restaurant into the decor of the new restaurant.  The restaurant was packed solid.  The noise level was probably the most negative aspect of the experience.  In addition to the already deafening noise level, live music started up and it soon became impossible to hear the conversation at our table.  I had the "north" chicken which consisted of a breast and a wing.  It was fried and was quite good.  The chicken comes with a choice of a side item.  The menu looked quite good.  The service was also good, but I believe the kitchen got backed up with orders since the restaurant was full.  I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant, if you have hopes of having normal conversation with the people at your table.
0	pBgaTZGgiAoeD30LjiQfQ	I went to lunch here today and ordered a barn burger with crispy zucchini.  The burger was luke warm and seemed like it was sitting there for a while.  The cheese was not melted.  Towards the end, I could not eat the burger.  The zucchini was hot and fresh but there was no seasoning on it and it tasted very bland.  The onion rings were freshly fried but had the same bland batter.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  The food came out fast and the restaurant was very clean.
0	IF99eeA3Y5etSXShstjRw	Sorry Jimmy but you lost three stars. Your sandwiches are alright but since you raised your prices ($1.50 per sandwich and now $1 PER item to deliver) we no longer care to order from you. Yes you are super fast, but I would rather wait the extra time from someone else then pay $10 plus delivery AND plus tip for a sub par sammy.
0	JGkVzlRMy7TSvQyOgtkBDg	Sorry, Jimmie John's, but I had to give it a 2.  Not because the food doesn't taste good, but because you have screwed up my orders twice in a row now.  Considering this establishment has only been opened a month or two at this location, not really doing too well, thanks.  Namely, I have ordered sandwiches and asked for specific items to be added to those sandwiches and no, those items were not on the sandwich when I got back to the shop and we opened them up. I thought it was awesome that they have the subs made so fast - like in less than a minute.  However, if speed compromises accuracy, then it isn't worth a hill of dog dung.  SLOW DOWN a bit and get the orders right!!  I did contact a manager at that store yesterday who apologized. I'll go there a few more times and see what happens, this particular location is about a block away from where I work, so easy enough to go back. Edited: Forgot to add that I am not going to take the manager up on his offer of a free sub.  I would rather pay and see if they are going to get this stuff right and not get any special treatment, just another face in a crowd and please get the order right.  I don't want to have to resort to opening up the wrappers on the subs I order, looking at it right there at the counter and seeing if they got it right - but if they are going to be Jack-In-The-Box style about accuracy, then that may be what I am going to have to do.  Editing: 5/16/2012 Went back again today.  I had forgotten on my main review of this place that there isn't a napkin to be found anywhere in the facility.  I have been in there a total of 4 times before today.  I was never offered napkins and couldn't find any, anywhere.  I was not asked whether it was to go and would I like my sandwiches in a bag on ANY of those 4 occasions.  I also forgot that I had also ordered oregano - it's a freebie you can ask for - on the last 2 visits and guess what I didn't get? Oregano, of course.  Today, I ordered two sandwiches.  I don't know if they got my manager's sandwich right or not as I had to leave when I took it back to the shop.  But mine?  I asked for Dijon mustard.  Maybe they ran out?  There was so little of it on the sandwich I could hardly taste it and the same with the oregano.  Perhaps you have to go squeeze back in there with all those people working the line back there to tell them how much of anything you want?  If you ask for mustard, does it not therefore stand to reasonably expect that you can actually TASTE it in the sandwich?  I don't eat mayonnaise so I make up for that by having mustard put on.  They did get the peppers on this time, though the amount of onions on the sandwich?  Couldn't taste them, either.  This isn't a Subway sandwich shop where you can tell them how much of whatever you want on it, but since it isn't, if a person asks for something to be added, there should be enough on the sandwich to actually be able to TASTE that it's on there.  Because of today's experience, the rating stands at a 2.  It's not a 1 but it's definitely not a 3, either.  If/when their customer service level rises up a notch - meaning they actually listen to the customer and perhaps do what the customer asks, then it might go up to a 3...........and it would be helpful if they actually had napkins out where anyone can grab them! Oh, I know, cost cutting measure.  Great, but on 4 visits I didn't receive a SINGLE napkin?  Look, in my book, simply because the people working behind the counter are nice and friendly does not make up for a complete lack of doing what you, the paying customer, are asking them to do.
0	DyGPaSD8Wh9uHhrWspfA	I think my girl hyped this place up too much.  She had gone to Montreal the year before and SWORE BY IT.  It was our last morning in Montreal before getting back on the road to head back home, so I made a point of eating there before I left.  Honestly?  It was just Denny's with crepes.  Nothing fancy. Ok - maybe Baker's Square with crepes.  Would I go again? Sure.  But I definitely wouldn't expect anything more than a solid effort at breakfast food.  It's really just "ok"
0	LMjxK25BLpOIwC3x8L3A	I've been here once, but I thought it was great.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese and it was so light and flavorful, like gnocchi should be.  I honestly don't think I've had gnocchi that good.... ever.  Also, the prices were more reasonable than some of the other options, because if they weren't, trust me, we wouldn't have ended up eating there :)
0	FFzzFinsK1hQwKYGNVSWJQ	i'm mostly judging brocach on its ambience since i've only eaten there once and hardly touched my meal (just wasn't too hungry that night). but this is definitely a place i love to come and meet up with friends. the booths are upstairs are big enough to sit 8, and when the rest of the group joins, there's plenty of room to grab a bigger table or just stand up and mingle.   i love the dark wood, the noise level (loud from voices, but the music is at the right volume), the beers. definitely my idea of a good bar.
0	NtAuM6qveGKdFk84qnFZKw	Panera is always an easy choice when I want a quick sandwich, salad, or soup, but I especially love coming here in Summer because the strawberry poppyseed salad is my favorite!  The only drawback...Pepsi products!  Good thing their iced tea is fresh.
0	4gbP3ZcgMz5KIHQtoHVHKQ	I have been to the Lancaster Smokehouse on 3 separate occasions, was there on Friday last week and then a year before. Unfortunately on all 3 visits my guests and I have been disappointed.  Pros: The restaurant has a relaxed rustic feel and offers a wide variety of craft beers. The wait staff are kind and do a good job.  Cons: The food is very poor quality. Ribs are not tender at all and have way too much gristle / cartlidge remaining on the bones which gives the appearance of a lot of meat. Pulled pork is OK, cornbread is sadly served cold, fries and sweet potato fries are pretty bad as well.    I have been to several southern BBQ style restaurants and although this one has the right idea with decor, atmosphere and beer selection ... the bad food is holding it back drastically. My friends and I have given this place several tries and we would not return.
0	n07LjUAlB2MQpXs0gc8CQg	I visited Jordandal after it was highly recommended by a friend of mine... stopped by on my way home for takeout.  There weren't that many selections but I opted for the Cubano sandwich.  After about a 10 minute wait (one other couple had placed an order ahead of me) I got my brown paper bag and headed home.  My first disappointment came when I took my sandwich out and saw how puny it was.  For $9.50 I expected a little more (even though it does come with a large side, which I didn't really want to begin with).  My second disappointment came when I saw that the "roast pork" specified on the menu (and expected by me) wasn't roasted & sliced pork at all, but a skimpy smear of pulled pork.  The final disappointment came after my first bite, when I realized there wasn't much flavor to be had in the sandwich at all, and I was much too far away from Jordandal to complain.  It's highly unlikely I'll be back.
0	c2Zr01KcmiBCLLoyrzyqIw	not bad, but not all good either.  ordered the carne asada burrito with black beans and rice. meat was a bit dry and chewy. The burrito was wrapped like a giant ball......kind of strange. a bit pricey as well. burrito and a small drink almost 10 bucks. YIKES! After my lunch I thought I would use the mens room to clean up before returning to work. OMG the bathroom was dirty and had a stinch like it was backing up. It had a very bad fowl smell and almost made me vomit....no lie! May return but not to this location. Would suggest to take your own beverage to save a couple of bucks. Oh, one more thing was not to crowed but the ambiance was cold and noisy inside. Music was very loud and the crowd noise even though it was not to crowed was fairly loud as well. The accoustics are not good at  all.
0	Tx9n7YKd8aGnQJhpFiGksg	Who would have thunk it.  Top notch Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas?  Um.  Vegas known for buffets and newly sprouted trendy bourgeois restaurants not pizza.  Try the stuffed Stockyard pizza pie it's grande. Take your friends.
0	j4zmZbBO8pqU52t5GFGAHA	I never thought I'd do two buffets in one night.  To be honest, I wasn't even that hungry.  I know it's sacrilege to walk into a buffet when you're not that hungry, but we couldn't decide where else to eat.  So why four stars??  Because I didn't feel overwhelmed or disgusted.  I wasn't too hungry, but I managed to eat well and not feel disgusted.  They had a good raw bar with fresh shrimp and crab legs.  The ceviche was damn spicy!!    Probably my fav was the Japanese noodle soup which they prepare on the spot so it's nice and warm, and the noodles don't get soggy!!  The broth was so excellent on a chilly winter night!!
0	0CWE4dtWZPZz5HQHX4MQ	I was here last week with a large group of girls (bachelorette of course) and the wait staff was very helpful.  They repeated the nightly specials and even made 2 special requests for some finicky eaters.  We paid about $60 each but it was well worth it.  I loved the Parmesan cheese chunks served with warm bread. Just to warn you though, portions are huge!  I'll know next time to share the main course, or order family style.  I swear the pasta dishes had about 1lb of pasta in each bowl! The captain was very nice, he even took pictures of our group on the outdoor patio!
0	pEd454ecTNcrwODJzrJw	In a city full of bars and clubs, this one holds its own by being a dive bar.. only las vegas style... people don't come here in jeans unless their american rag but at least you can get in somewhere with jeans, right? In any case, this is a nice placeto set up shop when you feel like going out, but not going all out.
0	xiUoOjAPO0x6YptoHjKmkw	The employee that decided to make fun of another employee took away from what is a usually very good experience at this location.  The young man making the sandwich was being very friendly, asked all the right things to make sure everything would be made correctly and was a pleasure. Then another employee started saying and asking things that made it clear that he was making fun of him or taunting him. The first employee looked shaken up by this but continued his excellent customer service.   Other employees got quiet and busy to stay out of it.  Food is always great, but manager should be checking out this kind of treatment by one employee to another.
0	CQQZd44SqIBVsrdWjzE5Q	So I'm on my way back from the DMV (that's another story for another day) and am hungry.  For anyone who doesn't know, they actually have a food counter at the DMV.  It reminds me of the food counter that used to be in the ice skating rink when I was a kid.  Well, the DMV food counter sends the smell of popcorn out into the crowd - perhaps to cover the stench of those who haven't showered for the day, week - whatever.  So this made me hungry enough to pull out my Blackberry and start searching for Chinese takeout on Yelp.  Thanks to location and the few reviews, I found the Pearl Wok.   I ordered the $5.50 daily lunch which included egg roll, soup and steamed/fried rice.  Chose the Beef & Broccoli.  Also ordered an appetizer/side of (6) Chicken dumplings and had them steamed ($4.95).  The beef/broccoli was yummy - broccoli was cooked well and not fatty beef.  The fried rice was fried rice - not extraordinary but good nonetheless.  The dumplings (or potstickers, as I call them) were great but the best part was the dipping sauce.  That awesome homemade brown potsticker sauce that has fresh ginger and green onions ... oh so good.  And now here's my favorite part - when I asked for the hot oil - they had it!!  Some chinese places look at me like I'm speaking ... well, English .. when I ask for the hot oil.  I'm sure it has a name but I'm going with hot oil - the one with the chili pepper seeds.  Oh my, put a little of this on your potsticker and dip into the sauce ... oh my.  Obviously this is written by a girl who likes a little "heat" ....  Of note:  They offer free delivery with purchase of $15 within 3-mile radius.  I'd definitely order again.
0	wQhEOUhkAqZOMu5tcxVg	So I went to the Roberto's across from UNLV because I had a random urge to eat carne asada fries. Now, I only get this urge once every few months because after I eat them I always feel like dying, but it's still always worth it. So the carne asada fries were priced at around $8 which isn't a bad price for the amount of food you get.  The carne asada fries come topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and probably more. I would tell you everything, but once you mix it together it looks like one big mash up of amazingness. The fries were pretty delicious, but filling. One order can most definitely be shared by two.  I've seen some other reviews talk about the service, but I had pretty decent service when I went. The cashier greeted me and my friend as soon as we walked in, and had our order out in a much shorter time than I had predicted.   Would I come here again? yeah, probably just for the fries. While the other food looked decent, I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food.
0	Foo6EcKPy4LDopwKCi4CQ	I was kinda scared to try this place because of all the scathing reviews, but I was optimistic and thought maybe the brilliant reviews had some merit. Doh! The food was ok and in ginagorous portion sizes. The appetiser portions are big enough for a decent dinner. The corned beef in the corned beef hash was really tasty, but what was with the watermelon and pineapple slices with corned beef, potatoes and eggs? The fried angel hair pasta that comes with every entree was just silly too...I don't know if it was just poorly executed...has anyone else ever seen sticks of fried angel hair pasta with dinner? The whole branch of rosemary as a garnish was weird too.  The service was pretty good. That and the corned beef are saving the place from one star.  Don't know if I'll go back...most likely not with so many better places for less money.

In fact, as my sandwich was being finished, they hustled me thru the cashier and I didn't get to see that they screwed up my order. My toppings were not done as requested, which was a problem due to allergies. I had to toss the meal out when I got to work.   Mike: you might want to think that one through. Fast service isn't better than good service.

There's still a little hope left that maybe they changed their hours and that's why they were closed... Anyhow, we decided to try the new Lindo Michoacan because it is near my house and I have eaten at the Green Valley location and thought it was o.k. so it's time for a second visit. It's nice in the inside-very spacious and of course the view is awsome!!! The whole strip is always in your view. Their chips , salsa and bean dip all needed seasoning. So right away I'm not happy. Not to mention the prices are too high-my chicken dish was $16.95. The kids meals were sad...3 mini quesadilla triangles are all they get on this huge plate coverded in beans and rice that the kids did not want to eat-what a waste!!! My chicken dish consisted of a pounded chicken breast covered in a chili and mayonaise mixture. That was very tasty but when everything else lacks taste it doesn't matter to me that one piece of a dish did have taste. We decided as a family that we didn't care to go back - there are so many other good Mexican restraunts in Las Vegas that I would save money on and not have to put salt in the salsa.

They offer a nice variety of BBQ meats, in taco form or plate form.  Cheap too.  I got the brisket, chicken, and fish.  Yep, SMOKED fish taco.  The brisket and chicken were both a bit dry and underseasoned, but the fish was moist, and tender, though a bit fishy.  Try it out, see if you like it.  Wasn't too impressed.  Seems pretty new, maybe they'll work out some of the kinks in the meat.
0	eJuP8Rl3uV9pnZ4qGhNA	We walk in for dinner and the place is packed. I'm thinking this might be a good pick. Then I realize it's First Friday. I curbed my enthusiasm. The three of us are quickly seated. (We made reservations) and then we waited....and waited. Then the busboy comes over and asks if we'd like water. A minute later someone else asks if we'd like water. Then our waitress finally comes to us and asks if we'd like water. (I'm  sorry I didn't  say yes to all three, but I thought I'd be nice.)  This is starting not to look good. We order our drinks and my beer tasted and felt like it had been sitting on a back counter patiently waiting to be served. It's less then cold. We ordered our Tapas and waited.  20 mins. later My dish is served and only mine. The second one served 5-10 mins. later. I had ordered the Cordero Chops. Australian Grilled Lamb Chops. The honey Aioli, served in a small PLASTIC container! Along with a bit of Cole Slaw that had no flavor, was slightly bitter with Pickled Shallots laid out as an after thought.   I understand Tapas size serving portions but, come on! For 12.00 I'd like to see my Lamb Chop. One chop was a nice normal size but the other was half the size of my little finger. The Aioli sauce tasted like it should have been used for the cole slaw. Which did bring out the taste. And the Shallots, well....My Daughter order the Garlic Camarones. (12.00) She said they were, ok.  Which brings us to the Paella Velazquez, (28.00) which my Daughter and Boyfriend Ordered. A disaster. It was sent back.  It didn't look anything like the picture on their web site. One of the main ingredients, LOBSTER, was no where to be found. Some of the other parts to the meal appeared to be missing or undetectable. I feel that if it's on the menu description, you should be able to see and taste the ingredients.    Because my daughter is more diplomatic and appropriate then I am, she spoke to the manager.  The upside to this very disappointing meal was that the manager wrote off the Paella, PLUS gave us a 25% discount on the meal and if that wasn't  enough she took it over the top with four free drink cards!  Because of the manager going over and beyond we will try this small Bistro again.   One last thing I'd like to add: I don't understand why so much confusion and unfriendliness of SOME of the wait staff.  No " how are doing tonight, our waitress didn't give her name. The girl who brought out our food just plopped it on the table and left. ( I expect this at Cantors.) Our waitress was ok.  I just think the service needs some looking into as well as the Chef keeping a closer eye on what is being sent out, under his name,  by the  cooking staff. There shouldn't be such a long wait time for food to be served and  the entire order should come out at the same time instead of piece mealing it out.
0	bzN6UrDPJ8tybNP6Y2FAg	Co-workers and I got stuck in I guess what is called Steele Creek, NC (right outside Charlotte) on our way a trade show in Atlanta and stumbled upon this place while trying to find a place that was open and still serving. Hard to miss this place at night as they usually have *live music *and is the only place to go late night without going to a strip club. Didn't eat but their beer list was very extensive and more than satisfied our needs.   Wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on their wide selection.  Jeff the manager knows how to treat his guests and wont hesitate to talk to you. First place where I've seen a Patron machine.  If I ever end up in this area (hopefully not anytime soon) I will definitely make this the place to nd my night.
0	7hg4EanDp8Ls1ANK7u3tLw	Meh...The person I went with liked the food and he's Asian, so maybe that says something about the place. I personally didn't like it and I dont think Im that picky. I say if you have other options take them and leave this for a last resort.
0	iYRvLmVRlA4RkXsu9pcyQA	This place is just OK. The bartender walked by to-be-orderers several times before noticing them. Drinks were sufficiently stiff. The food was hit and miss.   Nachos - cheese sauce (come on, we're in WI!) and very little cheese. The meat on top was dry, almost like jerkey. It must have gone on before it was broiled, or it sat under the heat lamp for too long. It should have not been served; it clearly looked dry.   Chicken Tenders - overall quite good. Good but probably not home made BBQ sauce. Fries were just OK.   Cheese Curds - very good, but not the best in town. Although unusual, the dipping sauce was an interesting change of pace. I think it was ranch dressing mixed with Franks Red Hot.    We got a goodie bag of free baked goods just before we left, which was a nice touch and a creative way of marketing.   I am tempted to take off another star because stakeholders in the business clearly wrote their own 5-star reviews (that were filtered out by yelp)
0	5RYx5OTkCheFe4ONaufA	If you cannot get on the base, don't worry about it, you are not missing much with this place at all.  The employees at not friendly, they don't look happy to be there and they act like short order cooks.    I'll explain this last part.. Obviously the meat used for the Philly is some sort of beef that is ordered in attached to wax paper.  The meat is so thin and not fresh it sticks to the paper.  The girl literally reaches in the place where the meat is and throws it to the grill. If she cannot get all the meat off the paper, the extra meat is thrown in the trash and your sandwich gains bread.  There is very little pride in this place, you don't really get what you pay for here, the fries and not that great, and the word loaded, which the advertise is nothing like the picture.  I will not be back to this place and both the people who work here and eat here are really missing out on what a Philly cheese steak really is....it is SO MUCH MORE the what you will get here.
0	0SJO36i1WddSjhUmWaBg	What can I say...it is what you can expect from Lawry's.  Good service and Great Steaks.  As always...we ordered tooooo much food, our eyes are always bigger than our tummy.  The Prime Rib was cooked to perfection and always great on taste.  9/29 - Backed for another business dinner.  Very consistence prime ribs, great service, and no complaints...starved all day because I knew I was coming here.
0	KQamqfEh3DpVWpyJvDikEQ	I will admit that I am picky about my sushi, and I was not a fan of what I had here.  I tried a cucumber roll, a vegetable roll, and an avocado roll.  All 3 rolls were extremely dried out from the rice to the veggies.  I have my doubts about whether or not it was prepared freshly.  I've had better sushi from grocery stores where I know it sat in a cooler all day!
0	RO1MH8mtcuuc2i6Zr4oj0g	I have lived in this area forever and can recall when this little place opened.  It was exciting to have a restaurant in the area.  After all these years I can say I still feel that same enthusiasm.  Pros:  The food overall is tasty and the menu is much better from what it had been in the past in my opinion.  Prices are rather reasonable even off happy hour.  Service has always been good.  This is an area that can be tricky since it seems the bartender is also in charge of waiting on the tables in the restaurant.  Cons:  The only real con is that this is clearly a bar that has tables for customers who may want to eat,  Originally there was a separation between the bar and the restaurant.  I do not necessarily mind this, but I could see some turned off by it.    I definitely plan on hitting up this spot more often. especially when the NFL comes back.
0	nCW7MCjpwyhI62Qvr0tEw	We stopped by Little Italy on our way home from Laughlin, NV and I have to say this place was amazing.  We had the gourmet pizza, and aside from it being huge, the topping were fresh, the crust was awesome and the service was great.  If your travels ever take you to Gila Bend definitely stop by Little Italy.
0	pgyxIuF5nSv9ZCimasnmzQ	Tasty cheap Chinese food. It's nothing fancy, just an order at the county place with cheap tables and chairs in case you want to eat in. Mostly a takeout place.  Lunch specials are just under $5 bucks, and they're pretty good. You get an eggroll, that actually tastes fresh, instead of that premade stuff everyone serves, a big pile of fried rice, and your entree. Portions are huge, like at some places, but it's certainly filling, and for the price, you just can't beat it.  It's not the BEST chinese food in the world, but if you're on a budget this place is awesome.  Any place that has boba tea gets an extra star from me. :)
0	SQ05IxTPnyVdWVBEtgW3kw	Eek.  Went in expecting a whole lot.  Yes, there is a whole lot of beer.  Lots that you may never see on tap unless you are quite traveled.  Lots that you see in the grocery every day.  Carded at the door.  This is Tempe, and it's a bar.  10 minutes until the waitress asks if we'd like a menu.  Yes.  Of course we want a menu.  You have 550 beers.  6 minutes later she brings two waters, for the four of us.  "I forgot your menus!".  The gents next to us hand us theirs.  4 minutes later we place an order for two beers.  I have to repeat myself 4 times.  My girlfriend repeats herself 3 times, only to have the waitress come back and confirm the beer she ordered (note: she guessed wrong!).  She then comes back to card us (remember, we were carded by two gentlemen at the door).  She leaves.  She then drops off our two beers, and a check, with no offer for a tab.  Strange.  I hand her cash, to which she brings no change back.  My two friends order two beers, and are, again, carded before being served their beers.  Their check is dropped, with once again, no offer at a tab.   We went across the street to Robbie Fox's instead of having another.  I doubt I'll be back.    + for a ton of beers, though I wonder how rotating those will go.  I have many doubts they will sell through 500 differing beers (x however many cases of each they have) before they start to get questionable.  + for some great beers on tap  - Running cards after every beer.  Not only is this annoying, but it costs your business every time you do so.  Color me confused.  - Poor service overall, from double or triple carding, to menu dropping / table touching / attentiveness
0	u2kDFwxAkYDKa3xiEUlL7Q	Growing up in California, my family has spoiled me with only the best of Chinese food. I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona, but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave.  Since it was opening week, the place was packed full and service was in disarray.  The decor was interesting....it was an attempt to turn an open food court into a fancy Chinese restaurant - chandeliers and all. Tacky, but honestly, I think it's amusing and gives it character. However, the location is very loud because it is after all an open food court. The table arrangements are also a little bit too crowded and I found myself almost back to back with the table next to me.  Food was decent and good price with the 30% off. I had the cold salt and garlic chicken, squid with black bean sauce, and the seafood tofu hot pot.  The hot pot was a little bland. It was nice to see them use fresh chicken, rather than packaged. Overall, it tasted decent. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. It was nice to have a little taste of what I miss back in California, but I probably won't be returning here.
0	aRcLjgVFVrnYcPIJZWL9Wg	What a great place to go in Vegas.  Not one of those buffet places.  Not one of those hoity-toity restaurants.  True, it's away from the Strip, but you get excellent food at reasonable prices (and you don't have to maneuver around slots and tables  to find it).  My favorite item as the albacore tataki.  My friend finished off the sauce by pouring it into her rice.  I was surprised to hear that it was a chain.  Unfortunately, they don't have any close by.  Los Angeles is missing out for sure.
0	fcsdLtSNTS0WOdj0TdpA	You pretty much know what you're going to get here even before you walk in the door.  Under-dressed wait staff, below average food, and overpriced beer.  This place didn't disappoint on those expectations either.  I'd have given them a higher rating if the talent level was better, but it just wasn't there, on a Friday happy hour - which should be the creme de la creme.  My wings were not crispy like I ordered and did not have much flavor.  The beer was cold - yay.    I'm not sure why you would come here to be honest, there are better sports bars all over Matthews/South Charlotte - you can do better.
0	SbVOUCQKT1bk01wJKh2Rg	I've come to the realization that some of the best restaurants are squished into shopping centers.  White Eagle is a little polish deli that has a lot in a small area.  In the back corner is a little market where you can get Scandinavian, Polish, German...etc. sweets and goodies.  In the front corner is the restaurant part, and opposite is the deli counter that holds all sorts of yummy desserts, deli meats, and fresh baked breads.  I've taken the breads home plenty of times.  Crusty on the outside, soft and squishy in the middle.  Best of both worlds.  The desserts are the best, and my favorite is a little heavenly number which is yet un-named...  It's a sandwich of light soft pastry that has layers like filo, but is much lighter...with a middle of the fluffiest custard cream.  Just sweet enough.  Then you get to the menu, littered with various hunter's stews, schnitzels, and probably the best pierogies I've tasted.  They have three kinds:  meat and rice, potato and cheese, and of course sauerkraut and mushrooms.  The latter two are my favorite.  One order comes with 9 pieces, and you can mix and match.  The restaurant is family owned, and every one of them are friendly and will answer any of your questions.  They close at 3:30pm and are closed on Sundays.  I haven't tried breakfast there yet...but it sounds appetizing.
0	rVHS3lh99jWEvxy5qKwIfA	I was told this was a good a place for tacos in the area, but I was very disappointed  since a stepped in the front door. The entire place was dirty, service was poor and food was tasteless. the only good thing they have is their hot salsas. overall Gross!
0	MhS6U6tM9HhzcvVjrtLBQ	Excited at first to try some Humble pies, however, my experience was a bit different than expected.  I went during lunch time, not as busy as it could be but a good crowd of lunch goers.  They have an "express" lunch menu for about $10..pizza and either soup or salad.  Well, service was really slow in getting the food out, especially a ceasar salad.  The salad came probably 15 -20 minutes later (seemed LONG), and then right after (like a minute!) the pizza.  The salad had HUGE chunks of celery which was weird to me since it's a Ceasar salad.  Tasty salad though minus celery.  The pizza, oven baked and thin.  Good not great.  Cheese was odd.  They had cleared my table and I was waiting for awhile, server had gone around my table yet too busy to come over and had to ask for the check.  Umm...if someone ordered on the express lunch menu probably means eat and go.  I was there for an hour or so, so not really express in my humble opinion.
0	tBgRvOzyr81k1Gtx56Ixg	Everyone (including me) is reviewing the food, but you also have to take into account that the other half of the building is a small nightclub. With live music. I was confused when I rolled up, like "what's up with all these ladies in heels? It's just a restaurant?" Anyway, the paisa in your life will be happy with the tunes here. I just personally don't like the gigantic police presence. No, seriously...they're everywhere. In front of every entrance and chilling out in an SUV at the edge of the parking lot, actively looking for someone to arrest.   Not a good feeling when you're just trying to grab a late-night bite. Not that the food was good anyway...as other reviews have pointed out, the carne asada can definitely taste old. We all know what something is like when it's sat in your fridge for a couple of days before reheating. I think it's gross to put up with that at a restaurant. Yuck.
0	pG1UCWpN4BIzOelEvbyw	We had a reservation for 8pm. It was a Saturday night so we knew a reservation was a must and made it days in advance. Some of our party arrived at 7:45pm and the rest at 7:50 and 8:00pm. We did not get seated until after 10pm!!!! I'm sorry but that's a bit ridiculous. Someone there either doesn't know how to count tables or take reservations. What's the point of having a reservation if you don't get seated until 2 hours later?   The drinks were pretty good but expensive. I had a Mojito and Caipirinha. Both were about $10-$11 per drink but I think they were tasty, so whatever. So we FINALLY get our table and it's almost another hour when we finally get our food. I believe in enjoying dinner and making the most of it but arriving at 7:45pm and not leaving until after 11pm is a bit much!!! The food was not worth the price. I had chicken enchiladas that were $18. They were 2 of the smallest and blandest enchiladas that I've ever had. The very small side of beans and rice were also bland. I was not happy about the food at all especially with the long wait and high price.   I don't think I'll be back to visit. It may be new and it may be hip and trendy but it's not worth it to me. I think Mad Mex is way better than Verde. Let me also mention that the chips and salsa are not free!! The chips and salsa verde are around $5.00 (no free refill on chips). The guacamole that was also bland is $10.00 with no free refill on chips. Save your time and your money. Eat somewhere else!!!
0	SFYP3ZLiI6rsCgcEQIhQtw	The ambiance is nice, but the food was just meh.  Calamari: I usually try to get my date to tell me a good long story once the calamari arrives so that I can eat it ALL while he's talking.  Not so here.  We each ate a few bites and left the rest.  I NEVER leave calamari on the table!  It was just not good.  Main dishes: Nice portions!  But nothing spectacular when it comes to taste.  I had the chicken cannelloni and it was a bit dry.  Wine: Decent selection.  The prices are great if you're on a budget, and the ambiance is nice if you're trying to make it a date night.  But if you're looking for basic American-friendly Italian, Olive Garden will give you the same menu with a better taste.
0	XHjLuWK5BOW0K1olr7m3Q	Food was not very good.  Used to be better.  Chicken burrito had good pcs. of chicken in it and nothing else. The red sauce on top tasted like ketchup!  I had to get it off, NG!  The Beef in the taco, yuk.   Chips and salsa were good.  Fresh cilantro was good at helping out the food and rice a little.     Won't go back.
0	4B3iL5tw8XDTahYuwTHZA	My brother found this restaurant, asking local folks where they went for Indian food.  Certainly the outside of it would never have attracted us!  But ooooh, the food!  The lamb curry was good, the chicken vindaloo was delish, and the goat curry (yes, goat curry) was to die for.  Service was swift and friendly.  The decor was odd -- a cross between New Delhi and someone's living room -- but that went weirdly well with the sense that this was, in fact, some fabulous home cooking.
0	PeUXZ1VXetNqkNdXxw4Kew	We had tried to eat here before and couldn't - after sitting at a table for 15 minutes without seeing a server, except the ones trying to avoid eye contact with us, we just left. They were busy that night, and all the staff had that shocked look of people totally fried because someone hadn't showed up for their shift that night.. However, one Saturday evening with terrible weather we went back for a second try.   Despite being a Saturday evening about 7:30, it was almost empty. One woman was finishing, and after we sat down a couple of guys came in and were seated. The waiter came promptly and took our order. The food arrived pretty quickly, and that's when the trouble started. I had no silverware when we sat, and when the waiter brought my food I pointed it out. He said he would be right back, then proceeded to walk to the back, and begin to take the order of a woman who had just walked in for takeout. After about three minutes of him helping her, then ringing her up, then wandering back to the kitchen, I just went and got my own from the bin.  I had ordered the Chicken Inka with beans and rice as my side. I received the chicken and rice, which was overcooked and had obviously been sitting around for a while. I'm sure this rice wasn't supposed to be crunchy. It took a second to register that my beans were missing, and the guy had left to "go get my silverware" by the time I noticed. Anyway, he showed up with the bowl of beans when I was done with my chicken, which was also the first time he came back to the table after he left the food.  People have raved about the chicken, and I don't get it. Yes, it was flavorful, but it was actually dry. Like the rice, I had the impression that it had been cooked a while ago, then sitting around the kitchen. On a Saturday night, that just shouldn't happen. I think the people that rave about this chicken haven't ever been to a Pollo Loco - the chain on the West Coast that sells marinated and roasted chicken. I can tell you that Pollo Loco chicken beats this place hands down - and it's a chain.  My guy got the Aji de Gallina - a creamy sauce over chicken and potatoes. It was well cooked and smooth, but honestly we have had the same dish at another Madison restaurant (Inka Heritage) and Inka's version is a lot more flavorful. Given the really spotty service (and I'm being generous by calling it spotty), dried out food, and a better option available in Madison (Inka Heritage), we won't be coming back.
0	EbjfeRb59HJ4FSUSNfAtQA	I love Faustos for the great mexican food and the price.  This place is always busy with lines sometimes out the door.  What I like best is the chicken tacos and California burrito.  I love the free salad bar that has peppers, carrots and green onions.  The staff are very nice.
0	l7pgaYOOxuIrlr3QQ3ciQ	This place is close to our house and we love the food...BUT the service, the 6 out of 7 times we have eaten here, is beyond frusterating! I only give it 2 stars because of the POOR service. Maybe they just need to work out the kinks...but, when? Great food but go when you have all the time in the world! The service will KILL YOU!  If you go to this location, ask for Colleen. She was wonderful.
0	3Aw5525xzzbJ53DJqtCg	This place makes me feel like I'm back in the Bay Area, among the hundreds of yuppie coffee joints that advertise Fair Trade coffee and free wireless connections.  It's not Peet's, but at least it ain't another Starbucks (not that I hate Starbucks; I just prefer local, neighborhood coffee shops).    I can't comment on the food, although it does look pretty good, and apparently it's all organic, if that's what you're into these days, like everyone else.  I had a cappuccino, it was all right.  I also had some coffee straight-up, and it was good; dark roast.  Not too busy, but then again, not much is downtown on the weekend.  The place has a bunch of tables, which makes it perfect for setting up to work; and there's some lounge chairs and a couch to get cozy on and read a book.  Friendly service; varied crowd -- guy playing Diablo on his macbook; older couple doing whatever old people do on their laptops; a few ladies reading books; a few people studying.  Ack, my right leg just fell asleep.  Oh, and free parking as well.  All in all, great place; maybe not quite as indie as Copper Star, but way more space ....
0	0uChzjX7bm6tlMw7k2Jmw	I try not to judge a place by one underwhelming meal, but...  I had the baby-back ribs, and come on, y'all, I'm originally from Tennessee and didn't even know you could mess those up. The ribs I had were dry, under-barbecued, and generally hard to get down, even for a hungry lady. The sliced zucchini on the side was so salty they were totally inedible. The corn-on-the-cob was, well, corn-on-the-cob.   Prices weren't cheap either. It's unlikely I'll be coming back.
0	PMQnise4NMITA7dvcfu1A	We finally made it for breakfast after seeing such positive reviews, we go to Litchfield often for evening outings, thought we would check out breakfast. First thing we noticed is you walk in and no one acknowledged us, not sure to seat yourself or wait.  A couple of waitress's hustled by but never said anything.  After about 5 mins of standing around we asked a waitress about it, yah grab a seat- thats it.  ok, chalk it up to busy? not really maybe 5 tables with people eating.  We find a table, again sat for 10 mins before approached for drinks.  We ordered the traditional breakfast - once we got them, they were good.  But sitting for 40 mins for eggs, bacon and potatoes is a little much.  Not sure if this is normal or they were understaffed, our waitress never acknowledged how long we had been waiting for our food.  Since we arrived later in the morning we did see alot of lunch plates going out of the kitchen, may give them another try for lunch.   We always support local small business but the service today was very disappointing to an otherwise very cute restaurant.   We will try them again but not a fan today.
0	OKCq8qz9XSnco34W7OpSQ	So Ive never actually been to News to dine but I have been to two events catered by them.  The first was advertised as a brunch (my complex put it on) but was sad to see it wasn't breakfast foods at all. The food was at least good though. When you expect breakfast and get lunch you cant help to be  a bit disappointed. This may have not been their fault though to be fair.  Last night I went to a second and while the food was alright they had no labels on anything -  one salad dressing choice( blue-cheese?).  They didnt have vegetarian options on their sandwich tray-which was over-packed and hard to decipher or pull apart. It would have been nice to have tongs for the sandwiches seeing that it was a public event and the idea of everyone touching my food is not particularly appealing. They also didnt even provide a spoon for the salad dressing- it had a plastic knife in it!  The chicken salad was good as was the pasta salad. I loved the HUGE delicious rice-crispy treats.   I may try this again at the location but I wouldn't recommend them for catering that's for sure!
0	R3maMwF4Mnf04z8O1GQpWA	Ordered chicken wings along with our pizza, I guess that gal up front didn't know that there fryer wasn't working... needless to say didn't get the wings... oh well.  The kids had fun, except for that one game that took our coins and didn't deliver the opportunity to play... did get a refund... will not be visiting this location anytime soon...
0	uzyWKETGTdSynlpvtYhUFg	My husband and my family always loved this place when it was located on Trop. Ever since it moved it has went downhill.  Tried to go eat lunch there last Saturday ( with our 16 month old son) and was told they only serve lunch in the bar. Ewww, no thanks ! Obviously with my son we couldn't , but why would I want to eat in a smokey bar?! They advertise lunch , but apparently not the case anymore . Very disappointed in the 2 times we tried it since the move. We would eat there all the time before , even recommended it to locals and out of town friends and family .     I really hope they get the same quality of food and management back like they use to. We will not be back anytime soon.
0	cDQRvjnMMPYoA9CaRkOhvg	We were there for the first time tonight, and were looking forward to it since my friends live 5 minutes away.   The atmosphere was good, though the band was due to start 1 1/2 hours later than advertised due to a wedding. We LOVED the bartenders who made sure my friend got as much of the last bottle of chard that was available (but one bottle available on a Friday night???)   Was not too fond of all of the little kids running around the place post-dinnertime.   But the killer for us was the wafting sewer stench that came and went the entire time we were there. we originally planned on eating dinner there, but after a couple of drinks, we just could not take it anymore.   SCF is a diamond in the rough, and we hope that they can work out their issues because we'd love to be able to spend more time there.

Being in my late 20's, I thought it'd be too young for me and our group (parents were attending). After spending more time in Madison, I heard so many people recommend it, if not just to say you did it, so I decided to enjoy a birthday meal here.   All in all, I really can't say I was disappointed. They were easily able to accommodate a table of seven on a Saturday night (we waited for about five-10 minutes). The staff seemed exhausted (Badger game earlier that day) but still polite (even if our waiter got multiple things wrong). The free beer was a selection of any of their (roughly 20?) taps, which made me happy. The crowd wasn't obnoxious -- a bit loud at times, but that was to be expected. And the food wasn't horrible -- I was able to upgrade the beef in my burger to a higher quality (listed on the menu) and the pretzel roll it was served on was fabulous. The fries and cheese curds, though I'm sure they're from a food distributor, were still really good. Yes, predominately bar food, but they had options and kicked it up a few notches quality wise. Of course there are better/more unique places in Madison, but that isn't always the reason you go out.   We left after dinner, so I don't know anything about the bar/late crowd.
0	DErURkaQCtpQhq5MvQAJSg	Stuck alone in a new city driving around looking for a place to enjoy my lunch hour, a sign caught my eye in a strip mall.  New Zealand?  My mind flashed back to my college trip to the Kiwi Isle.  Back then I was determined to eat something New Zealand other than the fruit.  Everytime I asked where a good "New Zealand style" restaurant would be I ended up directed to a mediocre Chinese buffet.  Sorry, New Zealanders that is from China; the Maoris did not invent General Tso's chicken.  Perhaps my culinary quest was at an end.  I pulled in to the boring suburban strip mall and 'Sushi bar' was stenciled on the windows underneath.  Slightly disappointed I decided to give it a whirl anyway, though a bit skeptical that sushi in a southern suburb might resemble that in a King of the Hill episode that was derived from canned tuna.  Opening the door however I delighted to see a very tastefully decorated and quaint interior with what looked to be actual Asians and not disguised Mexicans.  I, of course, tried the local Charlotte roll which was an Avocado on top style, my favorite.  It was delicious.  I'm quite pleased with my strip mall gem.  Update: Since eaten here around a dozen times.  I've tried tons of their specialty rolls.  My favorites were the: HOT Roll - jalapeno, spicy tuna, cream cheese! Ichiban Spicy Roll - Spicy Tuna, Crab, Avocado, red sauce Bombing Roll - Fried in mint leaf Wasabi Salmon Roll (w/ out mayo, eeg) - it's beautiful Rainbow Roll - Even more beautiful and delicious  Also, good is the fried banana 'sushi' (which is more than enough for one person), the red bean ice cream and the really good service.  It was a sad goodbye my last week there eating 5 times.  Thanks everyone there!
0	IV9Wi1wObyrKKcOwuQVTzw	Came here last night with a restaraunt.com coupon.  Sat outside and the patio was nice and our waitress was great, now lets talk about the food,  the menu has changed alot since we were here and not  for the better,  we ordered the guacamole $6.99 for a very small portion of flavorless guac we had to add so much salt just to get any flavor out of it, we ordered the chicken fajitas and it had about six  strips of very dry chicken on a bed of greasy onions and that's it, veggie fajitas were onions and peppers a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of zucchini, everything was so overcooked and caramelized it was just a greasy mess. The rice tasted exactly like rice a roni and the beans tasted soured.  Never again so glad we had the big coupon and didn't pay full price for that crap.
0	0TZ6RfBHJqfAoAseJOKIKg	Recently had lunch here. Service was top notch, the food was disappointing and not fresh. My chicken salad had spoiled (rotted ends)  lettuce greens and a spoiled cherry tomatoes. I discovered these items half way thro my very large salad , nonetheless it dampened my appetite and I did not trust the rest of the plate . It was pointed out to the waiter who removed the plate from the table but not from my bill . Coffe was good.
0	woTqg0JHMHVA4BoT1dxLdw	Healthy Fast Food....does that even make sense?  Is this an oxymoron or what but that's exactly what this place does.  Great selection of vegetarian and vegan dishes and great organic shakes at reasonable prices.  No they do not have a dollar menu so expect to pay about $8 - $10 for a combo meal.  Believe me, it's well worth it.
0	fY0I3e2ZPVCmXYP2Zm2g	I have eaten take out and delivery from this restaurant before.  The previous meals were good.  However, tonight I ordered a cheesesteak and tiramasu to be delivered.  The cheesesteak was cold, the fries were undercooked and cold and the tiramasu was bordering on being frozen.  The only item I ordered that should have been cold, a 2 liter bottle of soda, was warm.  The delivery person was not friendly at all.  I'm disappointed.  The first two times I ate here the food was good, it has definitely gone down hill.
0	2Uaavd6ledC39Ach2bwa0A	I love Dean and Deluca...they always have the best sandwiches and salads!  When I arrived in town for Thanksgiving, it was the first place I visited.  I love that you can visit and get a whole meal to go, eat lunch there, or go for a dessert and coffee.  It truly is all things for all people.  I only wish we had one in Houston!
0	Q13avOzCMuZNyzxXUjjfA	Appetizer and happy hour deals are extremely good.  The Sushi combos are unimaginative.......but the rolls are good.  The ambiance is typical Phoenix....kinda boring.  But, overall, this place is worth going to.
0	nxBtWNwhMFAwalEmSGRPA	So I'm a huge fan of supporting local businesses and on a lazy Sunday, I drove past the Dunkin and the Starbucks, excited to try Beanz Coffee Cafe after seeing it many times. First thoughts? All this seating doesn't really exist. There is so much negative space outside--why not capitalize with a few cafe tables? And there's just a big gaping space in the center where there should be tables for two; if there were a long line, I could see it making sense, but there wasn't so it made how empty this place was so much more obvious.   First glance at the menu, this is clearly a shop for people who like some coffee with their sugar. Lots of flavor syrups and unique lattes for a sugary concoction with a small dose of java. But that's OK--different strokes for different folks--and maybe that's the ticket to a delightful coffee beverage at Beanz.   I, on the otherhand, opted for an Americano which I thought would be a safe bet but boy was I wrong. Watery espresso with no crema--none. I can make better drip coffee at home. For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.   But maybe my breakfast sandwich would be better? Don't even bother. The bagels, I swear, are Thomas's from the bag. I've had better bagels from the grocery store. The eggs were microwaved (gross) and the cheese was just processed yellow Kraft Singles.   One word? Avoid. This place was such a disappointment. I certainly won't be returning.
0	Kgyd2zDtmZAbewskEqvA	This restaurant is located in the New York New York Hotel/Casino. The food came hot and fresh in pretty big portions. Very good stuff :] Made me so full. The bartenders were cool too. My friend had a really good Margarita and I had a yummy Cosmo. We liked this place because of the atmosphere, people and food. Nice, relaxing decorations. And our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I'd go here again to try some of their other dishes.
0	w3sGRXCBp1fP4xTTCzYg	I am a person who gives all people the benefit of the doubt. I try not to judge people based off of the first even second encounter, but the third? Now I can make my judgment.   The coffee and food is fabulous. Pastries are fresh, sandwiches are tasty  and coffee is done right.   There is one major problem with Rumbletum and for me its a deal breaker and thats is the poor customer service and morose attitude from the owners. They have been unfriendly and miserable everytime my husband and I have gone to the cafe. We have not been welcomed with a smile once. They seemed inconvenienced  by taking our order And completely unresponsive to any small conversation or even friendly small talk. We don't expect too much from people but there are  certain courtesies that I expect from people in the customer service industry. Throwing my sandwich on the table while staring at the ground and turning around and walking away is rude and inconsiderate. We tried to play a game of cards and not let two sulky people bring us down but their bad attitude and grumpy demeanor managed to make us feel unwanted and uncomfortable, just wanting to eat and leave.   If you hate your life so much you have to take down the patrons that are supporting your small business over any other place,  the why did you open a cafe at all?   I gave two stars because they care about the quality of their coffee and food, but unfortunately caring about your customers is more important to me.   We will not be returning to Rumbletum after three attempts at allowing the owners to show a shred of politeness.   It's really too bad...they have so much potential.
0	85xHXtMrjf35fIt4cqGTCg	The interior is pretty and clean and the staff is nice and helpful. As for the food this place is good but not excellent. However for a casual lunch meal it was worth it. You get a spring roll, a small soup, rice/fried rice and the entree for 6.95 USD. Be aware though that the pad thai does not come with the rice. The entree size is kind of small. I usually do not eat much and it was just about right.
0	KySheDgkvShZcMsDyuKwyA	Go to in and out. It's across the street, cheaper and tastes WAY better. They don't have combos and the burger alone is 6 bucks. It's good, but I could recreate it at home. The fries - yuck! Very plain. Save your money!
0	L4qMclNxa2piTdlmx9FGpQ	Food: Generally good to excellent.  Recommend the House Specialties in particular.  Some of the more ordinary dishes like Garlic Shrimp are good but not much better than you'd get at other Asian restaurants.  Lately (2007-2008) in my experience there can be a tendency to skimp a bit on the proteins in the dish -- there were only 6 shrimp in the Garlic Shrimp dish ($12) and only a few pieces of tofu included with the Curry Squash.  Service: Tends to be slow.  I've dined in at the Willy Street location and carried out from both Atwood and Willy Street locations, total about 10 experiences, usually in early evening on both weekends and weekdays.  Servers are friendly but tend to mosey even during busy times.  Expect to spend 1.5-2 hours for a meal with 2-3 people.   Add 10-15 minutes to their estimated times when carrying out.     Value: Decent.  Prices have jumped quite a bit in the past 6 months or so, though this is probably related to overall rise in food prices.  Entrees $12-16.  Overall: Agree that it's one of the better Asian options in the Madison area.  If you have time to wait, the food is usually worth it.
0	EtOUhOXTH1IK8dEJCssw1w	Not sure how to rate this place. I tried to order breakfast based on other people in my office. I ran into a little snag, the menu I have for them doesn't list their phone number. Only a web address! Get this the website is down under construction! How do you print menu's with no phone number and only a web address that is under construction? I could not find a number on the web either. Before coming here I called the Tempe location they didn't know the number either nor did they care to try and get it for me they hung up! Bad business. So as of right now I cannot rate the food only the sucky service. I doubt I will be trying the food after this fiasco!
0	MKkxQnIzux5FKn8NSOfTg	With all due respect to the previous Yelper who gave this establishment five stars... I disagree, sir. I strongly, strongly disagree.   I had just left Target when I saw their sign on Decatur and turned in. I was very much jonesing for some carne asada tacos, so I ordered a few of those and a burrito for my dad (I was on my way to his house). Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process. No. The tacos themselves were ok -- ok in the way that you make yourself a grilled cheese at home and are ok with it.   Flavor-wise, I would not return to this place. Re-heated carne asada wise, I advise you to stay away.
0	N9uSc7HfGtOrhzoELXobA	My husband and I were regulars at Eddie's so we really wanted to love this place, but it falls short for me.  I've been there three times...two times too many, if I may be honest.    My husband really likes the potatoes at Brigs (we're from New England and have an affinity for home fries, as oppose to hash browns...and home fries are hard to find in/around Charlotte).  For me, the potatoes aren't nearly good enough to crave going there...particularly for the breakfast fare.  As a matter of fact, the last two times that we went for breakfast, my son and I ordered Chicken Tenders and a BLT, respectively.   They make a decent BLT and my son said that the chicken tenders were "OK", but we really wanted to like Brigs enough to make it our go-to breakfast place.   Service is pretty good, the restaurant is clean, and the menu "looks" great, but it's just not my cup-of-tea.  Oh well.....the search for a good breakfast place continues....
0	wGzHp4dbAvAh0Dna9q22A	Could be a fun location, and the "scenery" was awfully nice as well.  Since we weren't allowed to eat on the deck with our small dog (and I think they'd do a LOT more business if they were pet-friendly, considering their location), we had to order our food to go.  We ordered two sandwiches (a turkey sandwich and a catfish sandwich) which took almost a half hour to make.... wondering if they had to go out and catch the fish and turkey first.  Once we finally did get it, it was pretty good.    In observing the deck area, it seemed there was a lecherous older gentlemen coming on to many of the servers, who eventually managed to talk his way on to somebody's boat for an afternoon excursion.  Provided for some fun people-watching.    Overall, decent.....but it could be so much more.
0	AVcbcxuzMzH950kBf1qXbQ	My man and I had a late breakfast here on Saturday morning. It wasn't packed, thankfully cause I was starving. We ordered a large sandwich  combo that came with fresh made chips and drink. The sandwich was huge, made for four people it seemed, loaded with premium meat and fresh product, on freshly baked bread. The chips were okay, I think they needed more salt.  However, the waitress was a doll and the other people eating there were nice and also engaged in conversation. It was a good meal at the right price, and now I know they deliver!
0	eH8qndqAEcWwqs5DxlatJw	Yes, the best bagels around.  But, you really get nickeled and dimed.  Really, a dollar extra for tomato and lettuce on you sandwich.  Oh, and now two less bagels in a dozen if you use a credit card.  A regular no more...
0	EPdj6KngLlUrBMODIPB37w	The Sherwood Cafe is located in the Excalibur Casino. Now, why am I reviewing it? Well, one thing I noticed in my brief stay in Debauchery-Land is that the restaurant selection is surprisingly poor. No, I don't want to pay $30 for an all you can eat steak buffet ok? This option out, you are in for some limited choices.   The Sherwood Cafe however is your standard breakfast place, except with a Keno board on the wall. The prices are somewhat high ($10) but what can you do eh? They serve typical breakfast and lunch attire and vegetarian options exist.   The food turned out to be decent, and the coffee floweth. This was a nice reprieve, booth and all, from the noise of the slots and the gaudy attractions.
0	P70f6U0W7sHAUnZc6k2zBg	Wow, not such friendly reviews.  Maybe I can help.  It's true, the mexican food you receive here is not what many are used to in that its not as spicy and the menu is limited.  However, if you want to try the REAL mexican food instead of the Americanized, "cookie cutter" versions that surround the rest of the town, Restaurant Mexico is the ticket!  It's a mom and pop joint with friendly service and wonderful hospitality.  True, the restaurant is lacking in decor, but it is clean and gives it a small town restaurant feel.  The food is on the lighter side and doesnt leave you feeling bloated when you leave which is great in the hot Phoenix sun!  I recommend the cheese enchilada combo with the green sauce...delicious!  The cheese is light and the texture is wonderful.  It's the first time when eating an enchilada that I actually slowed down and savored every bite!  Yummy!
0	pi3nulhj0VUjdebVihiVsQ	Funny story. The service was weak and the drink I had was horrible and was forced to pay 10$ for it.  Unhappy I tipped that waiter 10% and he had the audacity to come and complain that I didn't give him 15% WOW!  Food was ok, but I won't go back.
0	77zR8D2vURTYqLqOTNIFQg	This was the 1st time I have ordered from Grazi's   I was real pleased and enjoyed the pizza.   I ordered a Grazi specialty and uuummm good.....called back after placing my order and added 4 canoli's too my order and they didn't bat an eye...They made a real canoli not like some fake things you find in our Stores out here in Vegas....all in all I will be coming back to this spot for sure...
0	TQQdw2OcvElV55A4FGQCw	First impression, the place looked really nice.  It smelled authentically Chinese too.  But ultimately it's about the food and that's why it gets 2 stars.  Small portions, high prices and frankly, weak food with poor service are a bad combo.  The Kung Pao was unlike any I've had before.  Hard, small, dry, fried bits of chicken with some peanuts and a half pound of dried red peppers with no sauce and no veggies was somethng I'd not like to have again.    The black bean chicken, had no veggies and the sauce was thick and gelatinous; almost slimy.  In fact it was so gelatinous, after a few minutes it actually acquired the semi-solid jiggle of actual Jello.  It should be called corn starch chicken, not black bean chicken.  The service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.  Someone, a manager looking guy, was yelling from the kitchen to the bar (all the tables are located in between there) asking who had his Sharpie.   My daughter asked if she could substitute plain noodles for rice with her kids meal and the waiter just said "No."   Then later he mumbled some comment about "everything being pre-portioned"  Pre-portioned?  Is this just microwave food?  A Chinese place that doesn't have any "unpackaged" noodles??  At $55 for 2 chicken entrees,  2 dinky kids meals and 2 iced teas with nothing else, I was robbed!  Then my biggest pet peeve- the 20 minute disappearing act after they cleared our plates and we confirmed we didn't want anything else. Meanwhile the waiter walked around looking busy and doing nothing while avoiding eye contact and not giving us our check.   Honestly, It just made me crave some superior Chinese fare, along the likes of Panda Express.   Pei Wei and Changs? You can laugh this challenge off.
0	Xn3iLZGe7e5VnXBZyXbCA	I've only gone here for breakfast and brunch.  Like most breakfast buffets, this one is overpriced.  However, even the entrees are not that good of a deal.  The killer for this one is that there are many alternatives within walking distance.  The only reason for repeat visits was that they were comp'd by the hotel.  That said, the hotel is beautiful so the ambiance is solid, and the service was top notch.  2.5 stars.
0	GlRwqxQNbWrBmsYkdPw	This place is just ok, but not good enough to go back. The mac-n-cheese, as my husband described it, tasted powdery....definitely not fresh. The food was just okay in my opinion and the place had a weird vibe. New decor, but it still felt dirty in there. Like the paint, table and chairs are hiding what once was.   I hate to say it, but it's the kinda place you just know won't be there in a year. Nothing stood out and my 3 year old, who loves mac-n-cheese, couldn't swallow the food....otherwise I would've gone 3 stars.
0	hHraIQS5c2tMYBjcvoxL0Q	Lack-luster French food (bad soup, over-salted fish, however the beet carpaccio, filet mignon and desserts were ok), very slow service, predictable decor. Definitely not the best French BYOW in town.
0	CaLjVL6mkzZfVkTVOkSijA	Middle eastern/arab friendly coffee shop, the guy behind the counter was rude, not respectful and unfriendly, I'm sorry, I'll go elsewhere on the Plateau spend my money or in the Mile-End with the hispters! My americano was good though. Free wifi here!
0	mbe2EGu1vuXOsqOPyXIMMg	I feel weird reviewing a Dairy Queen because most people already know what to expect for the most part. But this location was particularly yummy. The service was good & you can tell the owners of this location take pride in what they do. The only bad part of my visit was the customer bathroom wasn't the cleanliest, but I never expect much from public restrooms anyway.
0	IueFoWTn5VMGJ27AtrUg4g	Great deal. Great service. NEVER go on a homegame day. EVER. No one ever listens to me but I swear that the cornmeal pancakes are some of the best I've ever had. As my boyfriend says, this place serves food that "sticks to your ribs."
0	4SulZVnKTL2MZdtTxElYJw	I liked it.  The restaurant is small and many of the tables were reserved, so we sat at the bar. From the moment we walked in we had nothing but good service, from being greeted, to our bartender/server, to the bussers, and even another server who had his own tables but was friendly and thanked us for coming in.  Bread is fresh and warm, mixed drinks are strong, and the caprese salad is awesome - several slices of tomato and soft mozzarella garnished with basil, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers.  There were entirely too many fantastic-sounding dishes to choose from. I went with penne pasta with a light gorgonzola cream sauce and sausage, my hot date went with lasagna. Although I could have used a little more gorgonzola kick on my pasta, it was still cooked perfectly and the sauce was clearly homemade, not heavy, and went well with the sausage. I had a few bites of the lasagna as well and the red sauce was pretty good - not too acidic, not too sweet.  This restaurant also provides a perfect amount of food - not too much that you're going to have a ton of leftovers, but you will be pleasantly full and pricing is appropriate to that - reasonable to inexpensive. While we ate, we noticed several pizza orders were picked up. More than several. Maybe one every three minutes. I am definetly going to try the pizza next time I come in!
0	3RQLfVQuMCzTCoVhzWA8kw	The food was fresh & good, unfortunately the service was lacking. Also when we returned to get refills we were rudely told there would be an additional charge. In a food court full of other options I will take my business next door to Firehouse.
0	U5Ml0Fc034OP0t3AwWlJw	Not sure if this is just normal for a place that just opened but pretty much everything was bad for us. Too bright lighting, dirty seats, hard to read menus, bad salsa, weird chips, terrible margaritas, slow to no service (had to ask for someone to come to the table) $18 for fajitas that contained 6 small shrimp? 3 tiny tortillas with that? Yikes, won't be back...
0	ggGxkwC8OKMOyS6O9nzxQ	We drove by this place next to Taj Mahal, and decided, when we saw a new Peruvian place, to stop in for lunch.  I hadn't had Peruvian food for some time, as Rincon Peruano is a bit far to make it a realistic lunch option.  The first thing I noticed is that the menu was very disappointing.  The selections were limited, and they were listed in English with Spanish translations secondary.  Sorry, but "Poor Man's Steak" just does not sound as appetizing as "Bistec a la Pobre."  Thinking that maybe this was an authentic place that just didn't have everything on the menu, I asked the server if they had Parihuela.  He looked at me like I was speaking Greek, indicating that not only did they not have it, but he was probably not actually a Peruvian.  With this minor setback behind me, I ordered my food, and what seemed like an eternity later, we had our meals.  The portions were acceptable, the presentation was good, but the actual food was pedestrian.  It wasn't terrible, but Rincon Peruano did the same dish better, and in greater quantity.  The bill?  $15.  Probably $3-$4 more than it should've been.  I guess we still don't have a reasonable Peruvian lunch option.
0	eoN8AGRMT1YAeYUC3XxNg	If you like Screaming O sauce, don't even bother coming here. I have been about half dozen times now and doubtful I'll be back.  The quality is in the decent-to-average range. The service is lacking but decent. The prices are a bit higher than should be for this establishment but not too far out of the range considering it's location and lack of any other decent sushi close by. There is a standard selection of sushi.  I have gone here because it's so close to my house, not necessarily because it's my top choice.    Las Vegas seems to be the market for Screaming O sauce. I've tried to order it every single time I have come in. The first few times they made something kind of close or I mixed it myself. Then I think I must have received  a new sushi chef one night because it was perfect! I tried coming back a few times hoping to get him again and I've haven't seen him since.   I went there tonight, made sure to order my Screaming O sauce before I even put in my order, it was ignored. Asked for it again. The new chef was stopped by the lady in charge and was told to tell me I couldn't have it without ordering a whole order. Fine, I said I would pay for a side of it. Answer was no, had to order all of it... Couldn't just get the sauce. Whatever, asked for the key ingredients and mixed it myself. Not the same or nearly as good as real Screaming O sauce.
0	twUTO4B2rSIhIdbMIGlcA	I went here with a bunch of friends. Three cheers for 2 for 1 drinks on most nights! All of our meals were large and yummy. Server was great, and had a good sense of humor. Food was delish. Check it out.
0	SWswkWpv6gUFRCVNWT3VMA	This used to be our go-to pizza delivery, but lately it's just not as good.  Last time the pizza was a bit underdone and it took FOREVER to be delivered.  So, we gave up and eventually went back to Bado's.  I'm guessing during off-peak times, it's still okay.  But be warned if you try to order during dinner time on a Friday night...
0	iF3WqmDaiwcHIyAHy3vgCw	As someone already said this is a very good college bar/restaurant -- and I suspect all the rules are for the college kids. I try to get there for dinner before there's a long wait (by 6pm), and it's usually crowded. Very friendly staff. Good drinks. Good prices for a bottle of wine. Best burgers? Don't know about that, but I rarely get a bad meal. This is inexpensive, homestyle food (meat loaf, etc). I also like the bustling atmosphere.
0	TbOjTYesUjxKLGLJeONGUQ	This place is unsettling. The decor is incredibly Asian-bistro, but the food is Italian. Also, the space is so incredibly huge, it feels like some sort of high school cafe mixed with a dance club....it's so strange! The whole "walk up to counter and order for yourself" thing wasn't too bad, but for an Italian restaurant, I tend to think comfortable, noisy, boisterous, homey, warm, inviting....Vapiano is none of those things. But anyway, onto what really matters, the food. I went with the Toscana pizza. It was perfectly meh. Hailing from Chicago, I guess I'm spoiled with pizza that makes my brain want to explode with every bite. Vapiano's pizza was pretty okay. As a pizza connoisseur, pretty okay doesn't really cut it for me....so Vapiano's really didn't cut it for me. I suppose it's worth a try though, just because it's so different.
0	e3exclrT9yo3cyUWhtCRw	I instantly regretted not going to one of the many Chinese noodle places on the same street when I got my bowl of "Sumo Ramen."  The flavor was bland, the bowl was small, and the meat was 1/2 fat.  The appetizers were mediocre and small and whereas I could get a fantastic meal elsewhere for $20, i was left still hungry and yearning for flavor.  Thankfully I stuffed myself with egg tarts later in the evening and felt better!  The atmosphere was nice though and 'trendy'.  The patrons were all young people - probably people who like myself didn't know any better and were drawn to the cutsy name, cartoon logo, and trendiness.
0	5xnHMzhvteoZX3OqMtJJw	OK, I had a taste for a burger, a double stack 2/25/15, got home and had single with cheese, i called store with issue, manager i guess, placed my name on log, went back on 2/27/15; told cashier hold onions with lettuce/tomato, checked burger, had onion no lettuce/tomato, went back and stated issue and the manager said in an not so nice voice, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME!!, OK, i know its in a diverse area, but still show common courtesy.
0	3iruvEQKa13BYNtjLDRQ	This is one of my favorite places to dine when I visit Scottsdale.   Delicious food, great wine selection and a can-do staff who always finds that line of warmth and attentiveness without trying to become a member of your dining party.  Comfortable seating and great sunset views from the outdoor seating area make it high on my to-do list each time I return to Scottsdale.  They have no fear of going off menu for you and always do it very well.  In the dozens of times I have been there (and hundreds of times I'll go back) I have on one occasion gotten a filet that was less than excellent.  But just once.  This is why they get four stars instead of five.  The prices are steep and everything is offered a la carte but in the context of such a quality experience overall, I find it well worth the price.

It was very homey.  I missed having my protein style and and animal style burgers. double doubles, 3x3, and 4x4. One thing about fries or for you Belguim homies/French Homies Pomme Frites. First of all you gotta get all the moisture out when you're cooking fresh fries from Idaho potatoes. So you gotta cook it twice so it's crispy. No one likes a limp fry. Most women like it crispy and golden and soft and gushy in the middle when you take a bite steam rushes out in ooey goodness when dipped in ketchup. Yea...that was hot.... So this is what makes this place cool. Old Fashioned drive in 50's feel. Feels homey like california. Burgers with secret styles. Simple Menus. Yummy Thick shakes!  Bad things..FRIES...Eat em animal style to simulate a fully loaded baked potato. But be prepared to clog your arteries. Mmmm Mayo...

It was the first place our group hit up on Saturday for the pub crawl and it did not disappoint in the cheap category. $2 Miller Lite bottles and $3 Zuma Juice were the drinks enjoyed by my husband and I. Chris said the Zuma Juice (vanilla vodka, cherry vodka, cherry juice, sprite and redbull) was like drinking Kool-Aid. Also on special were $4 Skyy and RedBull and $5 Jagerbombs.  So for $13 (before tip) Chris and I enjoyed five drinks. Also, service at Zuma whether you are at the bar or a table is always fast if you go early. Even though it was logical on how our group was split (three couples), our waitress still took the time to keep everything seperate and gave each couple a bill instead of having us have to figure it out. Not a bad daytime/early evening option on Mill, but I definitely wouldn't go late at night.

What a shame that a fine eating spot died and the exquisite space filled with overpriced mediocrity. After taking in the great show - Sinatra - we decided on a late night bite and thought about trying the new Lakeside Grill. Without a reservation, we waited around 10 minutes to be seated in what looked to be a half empty restaurant. The nice woman at the reception desk lead us to our table and got us seated. That was about the best treatment we had, considering the hyped up status of the place. A polite young man took our drink order and promptly came back with a bottle of Pellagrino. Our waiter showed up soon thereafter and handed us the menu. I am totally used to paying decent money for good food and service to match, but I was sort of surprised to see the prices on this menu. I think $50 for a 9oz Fillet Mignon is a little high. Everything is ala carte. We were not starving and decided that we were just going to order a quick lite bite - Strip Steak Sliders, fries, and braised greens. The steak sliders were $7 a piece, 10 bucks for the fries, and 10 bucks for the greens. The sliders consisted of a mini slice of steak stuck in the groove of a sliced mini-baguette. The fries were great - but $10? Greens were so-so. Bottom line - $60 for some mediocre snacks is a joke. I am glad we did not go for a full blown meal. Oh - one more little thing - after the waiter took our order - we never saw him again. Not once. Later in the meal, another woman came by to clear the plates and ask if we wanted any desert. She also brought the check. For that kind of money, someone should have asked if we were satisfied with our meal. nuf said -I warned u. Many better choices. Walk over to Encore - Society Grill.

The menu had many many different options, some more traditional then others.  This is the first place either of us ever tried fish tacos (we're from the East Coast, cut us some slack!) and they were amazing!  My husband did a wine flight which he liked, we found our server to be extremely helpful when we asked his advice.  Update: Ok, so now I've been living in Scottsdale for almost a year and Tapino is a staple for us.  Its really one of the closest "nice" (its not like its fine dining) restaurants to us.    I have to say that I don't find the portions to really be small.  Go to any trendy small plates restaurant in any city and the sizes of the plates will be the same.  Its all about savoring the way the different ingredients come together, not about shoveling food into your face. My husband and I always order about 4 plates and its always the perfect amount.  I think we may have gone over $100 once or twice but that included a LOT of wine.   The service I find to be very personable.  On one particular night we had finished our mussels with lots of the broth left over.  Recognizing that our server brought us over some bread for dipping.  (She must have read our minds!)

0	7hZ2zAUoBIGVwBOPe3dKQ	I was very excited to have chinese food tonight and it was definitely worth it! The appetizer lettuce wreps were my favorite. I also had the wonton soup which was pretty good! The sesame chicken was very good also! My family was contemplating on having dessert but our kind and very friendly waiter, Robert, gave us the Banana Spring Rolls desert for free.. what a nice man! Overall, dinner was great and I would gladly come here again!
0	SItDosWzpKyEkm2N8vKg	Been going there for at least a decade. I always get that soft Teriyaki nuggets, the shortbread cookies, and maybe a chocolate something (note: do not leave chocolate in the car; you'll have a chocolate brick!).  Hawaii folks know about it; It's probably one of the few things in walking distance from the California that's not simply another place to gamble.  One time I took some non-Hawaiian friends there and at first they were like "wth, where are you taking me?" But then we got in and they found stuff they liked.  They even told their friends so I think I started something.  I'll give it a 4 since the prices have gotten a little high in the last few years... (I mean if Hawaii had a trader joe's...)  but still, great place that I try to go to when I go by downtown.
0	EO4umEJag8X9EPA0K3wQ	I really really avoided going to this place altho I heard a ton of good things.  I don't know why... because it was pretty darn good pork.   One thing tho... it has almost been ruined by being franchised... starting to get a slight pre-made taste/feel to it.  I don't know exactly what a "pre-made" taste/feel really tastes or feels like, so don't ask me to define it, but when I go in, I feel like I'm walking into Panda Express or some other chain.  Food and service is still good tho.
0	Sq8U0MvWMwbZ6CXm4pP1nQ	I come to this place every time I visit Vegas.  The beers are good. The food is great and reasonably priced  My personal favorite is the pesto cilantro pizza, but I have really liked everything I've had there.  It is a really fun place to hang out at the bar.  My favorite bartender there, Mike, is quite the  charmer.  It's always nice to be flirted with, even if you are old enough to be his..uh.. slightly older sister.  I had to take away one star because the kitchen and bar close way too early.
0	Dq17OgK8v60189AXKaCeUw	Nothing special about this place at all especially since most entress are in the $15 range. Combine that with a $3 soda and you're talking about a $20+ lunch. Just not worth the price unless maybe if you're drunk coming out of Pure.
0	XAvDvPOlaO48kKEDEWkQQ	I think I've officially had my first taste of real southern BBQ.  This stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right.  I really liked how the brisket was nice and tender.  And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.
0	cdFaXRpCyqMMLrxAPQrNQ	I found this little place in Old Montreal while walking around. As I was looking at their tempting menu which was pasted outside the restaurant, the kind doorman invited us inside.  The restaurant seemed somewhat like a cafeteria- the d\u00e9cor consisted of plants and t-shirts that were hung around the place reading "I love Montreal" or "I love poutine". The tables and chairs were made out of steal and the chairs were uncomfortable. Montreal poutine had a backyard outdoor patio as well which many people preferred sitting in. The staff was super friendly but the service was extremely slow and non-existent. It took forever for our waiter to take my order, the food took a while to arrive, and after the food arrived, the waiter disappeared. I had to wait at least 25min for the waiter to be in sight again in order to ask for the bill.   Putting that behind, the food at Montreal poutine was really good and I'm craving it everyday! The menu consisted of a variety of poutine, salads, pizza etc. Oh, the "I love poutine" t-shirt was also on the menu. I tried the smoked meat poutine and their chicken caesar salad. The portions were generous, and the food was fresh and delicious! The poutine consisted of perfectly done thick fries, drowned in gravy with a good amount of cheese curds, topped off with tender pieces of smoked meat. My chicken caesar was big, yummy and fresh too. The salad consisted of mozzarella cheese and shredded chicken on greens with strips of crispy bacon- this is perhaps the best chicken caesar I've ever had! The prices were inexpensive too which was awesome.   Overall, Montreal Poutine restaurant has great food and prices, but do expect horrifying service and ugly d\u00e9cor.
0	hRdyTMK0jqkCdaCJfZMHeA	I chose this place for a group of us to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday (as we had been to Maggiano's twice in the past month I wanted to find something new).  I was very surprised at how good it was.  They were extremely accommodating to a large group (15) and the food was great.    While it is a little more upscale for a Mexican place there were some well price dishes.  The closest comparison for me is Z Tejas.  The combination plates they have are terrific value as I got two tasty enchiladas and a steak taco al carbon (rolled soft taco basically) for 12 bucks.  The margaritas (starting at $8) hit the spot and are even better if you upgrade the tequila to any from their large selection for just $2.  Well priced beers (for N. Scottsdale) at $4.  Guacamole ($7) tasted amazing and was a nice little treat to have it made fresh at the table.  The entrees ranged in price from $10 to $25 and had something for everybody.    Very attentive service for such a large group (although towards the end they were a little overbearing as they wanted us to get the hell out).    Highly recommend to anybody.  Will be nice when they open another one on the East Side of town (planned for Spring 08 in the San Tan Keirland wannabe)
0	WDJ8ZB1ukPXLZhi7SPe0og	Being open late makes this place convenient, other then that there aren't many positives. The pizza is okay,!the boneless wings are microwave boneless wings from Walmart, all soggy. Stay away from them.
0	iUAQb7RntBWdd7COjDsHnQ	The food is fantastic, but the service is not.  Had a salad and pasta with meatballs and it was all very delicious.  The service was terrible. The AC was dripping water on us at our table and the host refused to move us to a new table and expected us to just get water dripped on our heads and food all night. We insisted that we move to our server and eventually were moved to a large family style table with another family that we did not know...awkward.   Our server also semi-neglected us because she was trying to give speedy service to another table who had to catch a show at 7:30. Well, we were going to the same show and her focus on them and lack of attention to us made us late for the show.   Sienna needs to step up their customer service. They want to be an upscale restaurant, but they're providing diner-style service.
0	H2huXjOU8V9c7UsDH2XvSg	This restaurant chain is.. Decent. My bf and I have visited this location a couple times when we are craving mexican food and can't find anything else.   The beef tacos are pretty darn good but everything else is just ok. Beans and rice are very.... Bland just like their customer service. Now that I have discovered los taquitos on 48th and elliot featured on Diners,Drive-ins,and Dives. Boy is their carne asada worth the trip and gas. No more mediocre mexican cuisine!
0	Dyahb7sgMOvfEtTunGtg	Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!
0	C3FZRvxsAThdUU0ApvXw	I'm from CA where we have everything and anything so my review may be totally off for locals. I went to this place when they were about 40 minutes from closing. They had run out of the two things I wanted, Ribs and mac n' cheese. I got the brisket instead and that was ok. it was alot of food but is was just ok.
0	xVqYtbMSlrLdiiS76sDUSQ	I don't know if it's authentic or not because I'm just a white dude from Phoenix. "Pei Wei" could mean "American Sucker" for all I know, but I know it's damn tasty and kids like it too. It's fast and the food always tastes fresh.
0	nVBSIHNfIDmsu4YPi7CQBg	Oh yeah, of like coming here for their specials and low priced menu. For being very affordable, the quality and the quantity of the food will not disappoint.  It's a favorite among senior citizens, but I see all other age groups come here as well.  I love the Ribeye Steak, and I come on Fridays or Saturdays for the Prime Rib special.  Oh so delicious!!!!
0	fNwFwNx6SA4G4XJ7TxFg	The food is okay. The staff used to be really nice then they hired a ghetto cashier with gauges in her ears. Unsanitary, if you ask me. I took my food back after they gave me a chicken enchilada plate when I ordered a cheese enchilada plate. I may have let it go if the enchiladas weren't so dry. They barely had a few tablespoons of sauce. After I asked for my order to be corrected, the cashier told the cook that I was a crazy b*tch in Spanish. Umm, excuse me? Did you forget I speak Spanish? Especially since I ordered everything IN SPANISH? geez. Bring the old cashier back. Then I'll give this place a good review.
0	1BHW6gKyf5DDCeAFCviyug	Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performig their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!
0	HXBkgfgUUXZ8dPs7vlEDA	I would rate it one star if it wasn't for our salads being good.  A coworker and I ordered two salads for pick up, as we were on our lunch break and didn't want to waste a lot of time. When I asked the guy who answered the phone for two small salads, he asked if I wanted a "single" or "small." After asking him what the difference was, he told me that the small served 4-6 people and the single was good for one person... Hmm... I guess it would be a single then! From the website, it looked like there were only three options (S/M/L), but whatever.  When we showed up to pick up our order, it was pretty clear that they were short on staff. There were 2 people working and one of them was behind the bar pretty much the whole entire time. They were definitely NOT in a hurry even though the restaurant  had a good amount of people there... Just a couple of dudes putzing around!   Anyways, he ran our cards and returned with 2 piddly, TINY boxes of salads.. What? After sitting in my car and wondering why we were charged $7 for a snack of a salad, we decided to go back in and see what the deal was. After we told him that it wasn't explained to us what a "single" was, he admitted that he wasn't being exactly clear. "Yeah, it was probably my fault." Uh, yeah it was! That was all he said, no apology or anything. Now, we are not the type of people who go around looking for freebies, but you would think he would have been a little more... I don't know... Courteous! He ended up running our cards twice, since we wanted a larger order and disappearing in the back for almost half an hour. We would have left if he hadn't charged us, but we were stuck waiting... For...Ev....ER!  While we were standing there twiddling our thumbs, it was obvious that some of the other customers felt just as neglected and frustrated. One woman even had to get up out of her seat and walk over to one of them to have something taken care of. Not cool. Finally, he brought us our food and still gave no sign that he even cared about what had happened. It's a cute place and the food might be decent, but I would not go back to this location!
0	0plGTkmucNFwYqK50mJ1SQ	I should have been born in the 40's so I could have been a teen in the 50's. I wish there were more drive-in type of places to eat at, not that I have anything bad to say about Sonic.   It had been a while since I have been to a Sonic, and it's just something fun. Double burger and a route 44 ocean water. Good stuff!!! Plus you can get tater tots....where else can you do that? I will say that mayo on a burger is not my thing, but if you don't want it you don't have to have it.  Also, I know it's fast food and all the server is doing is walking out to your car, but it's Arizona and it's 110 degrees out. Give your server a dollar! It wont kill you, and it's better then giving a dollar to someone on the side of the street who refuses to work, but expects your hard earned money for nothing.
0	xtZxSYAXvCV36v48JGQ	Another one of my favorite "escape from Pittsburgh" locations. This small Thai restaurant, off the beaten path of Forbes Ave and looking pretty ghetto from the outside, is one of the coolest places for dinner in whole city. If you like tea (and I do), they have an entirely separate tea menu with a fairly large collection. Also, you can never, ever, ever, go wrong with the Ice Tea of the Day. So awesome. Almost all the food is good here, however my favorites were the singapore night noodles, the pad thai (i know), and my all-time winner, the "chicken with string bean" which actually comes with more than one string bean. As mentioned, this place is BYOW - and many people do. You get an eclectic crowd of college students, professors, and other academic-types mixed in with some curious locals. It's all pretty affordable too.
0	TupQUKyyNRVDnr1D48uYrw	A restaurant located in a dump of a casino named The Cannery. Service was very attentive. Please don't introduce yourself and say "hey guys". This isn't TGIFridays. Garden salad fed two, but not impressive. Hubby's chicken Parmesan wasn't too bad. I ordered chicken Sambaltica. Yucky. Wasn't pan seared, and came with a sauce that drowned it terribly. Sent it back to be cooked correctly, and it came back exactly the same. Ate the complimentary bread and martinis instead. Don't go without a coupon.  We didn't have one, and don't plan on returning.
0	3zGrB7NFotsIkOdLV4snwA	OK, so this Gilbert Red Brick Pizza isn't that much different than the other Gilbert Red Brick Pizza. BUT, one thing different is, I never tried the gelato at the other one. Big mistake!  Red Brick Pizza's gelato is made in the store fresh every day. They rotate between 50 flavors, offering 12 at a time. I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to, but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good!
0	Jdt3ybTL1HcjAAAfJixeKg	I don't know if it's because I was starving, but I really enjoyed my slice here. It was particularly tasty, crisp, and the right amount of sauce and cheese (not too much). I liked the seasoned crust bottom, unlike some other reviewers. For some reason, I always like root beer with my pizza, and my craving was satisfied.  What I didn't like: not much seating, Speed channel playing, styrofoam cups with instructions not to refill more than twice. I wouldn't anyway.
0	GcTFfr9OrBrr2vliwWtA	For years, I have fallen victim to Del Taco and its remarkably delicious soft chicken tacos.  From my time in California, to my move to Vegas years ago, my joy was no greater than discovering that my favorite junk food would carry over with me to this new state.  Over a decade later, I still retain a soft spot for the soft chicken taco, and this Del Taco is not a disappointment in this regard.  Regarding this location, the service is polite, the lines are fast, and to date, I've never had an issue with my order.  It's located in a shopping center next to a bar, and outside of the many 'Bertos taco variants, this is the other preferred meal of choice after ingesting a few liquid libations, or late night "I have to eat something" snack.  This location has gotten me through a few rough nights of working late.  That said, it's not the building, location, prices, or service that I take issue with.  It's the drive through customer.  I was reminded of this just today as the woman ahead of me screamed a string of profanities at the hapless girl inside the window as she sped away.  For you see, this isn't the first time I've witnessed something like this at this location.  Maybe they're drunk from the local bar.  Maybe it's just something about the neighborhood.  Maybe these people are just stupid.  Or just mental.  Who can say, really?  All I know is I feel for the customer service, because as mentioned before, the people working here really are nice.  The only fast food place I can think of that actually initiates a brief "How are you" conversation, and sounds like they actually mean it.  Regardless, this is a decent location that actually makes use of a paraphrased (and edited) line from "Clerks": This place would be great if it wasn't for the fudging customers.  Well said, Randal.  Well said.
0	2E2yS4mOsjSnfTKUWAbUw	This place is so lucky it redeemed itself with fantastic food, because the notes I was taking weren't so hot. This really is a prime example for Kitchen Nightmares.   First, the hostess made the mistake of making us stand by the door for 15 minutes after scoffing that we didn't have reservations. She literally acted like she hoped we would just leave. Finally she said, "well I can sit you at the bar if you want". Then another 10 minutes to get us menus.  Let's just say, sitting at the bar gave us the extreme look into the kitchen and all it's awfulness. Without seeing "behind the scenes" I might have felt more favorable about the restaurant in general.  First of all, they had three waitstaff, except there was a guy doing drinks and the blonde lady who was taking orders. Then you have this 15 year old girl (approx.) running around serving all the tables, making all of the salads from scratch, cooking the bread, delivering the bread, fetching refills on drinks, gathering the dirty dishes and bringing them out back and even doing prep work for the cooks. The poor girl was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and didn't even have a frown about it. Nobody else on the staff even cracked a smile, never mind even talked to each other.  I also have to give props to the chef who was very attentive and made sure everyone liked their food. When he made a steak, he made sure it was cooked exactly how they wanted it and refired when necessary. And the food was amazing, so he's got it going on.  Unfortunately, there were a few things.   First, the salad bowls are inches from the ground, on the bottom shelf of the prep table. When the girl made a salad, she was pulling it up from the bottom shelf to use the bowl to mix the salad in. Too close to the floor for my taste. Also, all the salads besides Caesar have MOUNDS of Olives in them, so make sure to ask for no olives if you don't like them.  Also, the lettuce bin is in the drink station, located an inch from the handwashing station. It would be a miracle if spilled drinks and soap didn't get into the lettuce.  They also use frozen fish. I don't eat fish, but I'm sure people care about this.  HOWEVER, in terms of our food... it was fantastic. I got the Rigatoni Arriabata and it was probably the best I've ever tasted. It's very spicy, but that's just how I like it. My boyfriend got a steak and it was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Honestly, the chef and the young girl pretty much ran the restaurant themselves. The blonde just walked around aimlessly and I have no idea what I guy was doing besides giving more dishes to the young girl to bring out back. Maybe he was waiting tables, but I only ever saw him making drinks.  Like I said.. GREAT food but a prime candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Also, I recommend the Caesar Salad. I didn't get it, but the garden salad was full of chopped olives and terrible.
0	jy1hocmH32BvKkysE6Ow	We went here on a Thursday night. It was busy in both the bar and the dining room. The service was attentive, but the food was terrible. The water, too.  The water was absolutely disgusting. We know Phoenix's water is gross, but there is something extra specially disgusting in the water in that neighborhood. For a restaurant to serve water that bad leaves me speechless.   I started with a side salad. It was a bed of lettuce and some grated cheese. For $8, I expected more. Onion or tomato, maybe? A mushroom?   I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. I was completely perplexed by my dish. The first thing I noticed was that it looked like it had sat under the lamps too long. But we ordered it 5 or 6 minute prior. The dish was hot, but the top of the food was lukewarm. Under the film that had developed on the top of the lukewarm-ish-ness of the dish it was warm, but not hot. Again, it was perplexing. It looked like the Costco Chicken Parmesan was served on my plate, but it wasn't as good. It was bland, and flat, and had no flavor.   My gf ordered the Fish & Chips. She said that they were "mediocre". The fish was average, and bland. The breading was bland, and too greasy. Nothing at all like the Fish & Chips at Four Peaks. I had a bite of the Cole Slaw, and liked it, though.  My gf's son ordered the mini burgers from the Kids' Menu. When I looked at the burger, it looked like something was amiss. I opened the bun, and looked at the burger. The cheese looked like the burger had been cooled, and re-heated. It was gross. The burger was like a rock. Bland. Overcooked. No texture. No condiments with the burger. He's 6, but even he knows that a burger should have some condiments with it. He ate 2 bites, and gave me the, "Really? Do I have to eat this?" look.   The only reason this place is a 2 is because we were in a hurry, and they worked to accomodate our schedule. I wouldn't even call the service particularly "GOOD", it was good enough to get us in and out in a timely fashion.   A decent family restaurant in the West Valley still eludes us. It's a shame that there are so many lazy, uninspired, unmotivated chefs in the industry. Are they even Chefs at this level, or do the owners throw a hodge podge of illegals into the back and call it good?   We will not go back.
0	g2Ib1ivFCT6UM1BQtYhog	I use to go here all the time, and I loved it!  It's ok, I can't say I will be running back anytime soon. I use to crave this place.   I'm not sure what it is that has changed since the last time I've been here. I just can't put my finger on it!
0	6XOY0rdZFRrXic9Dy7rxA	I've been to the Wahsun with my wife several times.  The food is always good and the prices are wonderful. Between my wife and I, we've pretty much sampled the menu and found everything good.  I especially enjoy the barbeque duck but everything is good. The owner's wife, Rose, adds with her, friendliness and personality, to the dining experience as well.
0	X0lv05yxdHGTzUKn2RV8g	One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Great authentic Mexican food, fun atmosphere. Even though I usually get the same thing (Enchiladas de Dennis), I have never heard anyone say they didn't enjoy their meal. The service is really prompt and the wait staff is friendly and helpful without being cheesy. Even on nights when it appears crowded, the restaurant seems to be really efficient with turning tables without rushing people in and out.
0	e8leae49pLENV7ulopZecg	Panda Express isn't bad if you want quick and easy Chinese food.  The selection isn't bad and the price is pretty good.  I went here last night on my way home from work and they took BBQ Pork off their menu.  :(  I would have given them an extra star if BBQ Pork was still here.  Oh yeah, and there is one more thing I have to say about this place:    FIRST!
0	ResT4Vwv4QHoefbyg0FmLA	Great Americanized Mexican food. The food is always yummy and quite tasty.   This particular location is one of my favorites in town. The area is nice and the restaurant itself is so big and spacious. No cramping in or having to squeeze into the tables/booths. Yeah for no claustrophobia seating like some of their other older locations.   I really enjoy the food here. No, it's not what my Mexican family makes, but it is good for what it is. I am addicted to their Baja sauce. You could put it on shoe leather and I would eat it up and ask for more! Do yourself a favor and try the Baja enchiladas with extra Baja loveliness.   As well as the Baja sauce, their smooth salsa is delightful. I have been known to pour it all over whatever I am eating for an extra level of yum. It also goes wonderfully with the Baja sauce. I live me some saucy goodness!!!  If you aren't in the mood for a big meal, check out the mini chimichangas. Add cheese on top and you have a great snack. Throw in a margarita and you have a party in your mouth!  The prices are really quite reasonable too. They have great weekday lunch specials, as well as happy hour specials. Also check your neighborhood newspaper and they put coupons in pretty regularly.
0	28sLGkJSoCshJycgEWy2Ng	Betty's Nosh....I'm so disappointed in you.    Here I am thinking finally-FINALLY a decent wine bar is to be opened up on the west side!  Could it be true?  After waiting an incredibly long time for you to open (including one locked door and another incredibly awkward encounter with your rude hostesses the day prior to your grand opening) I thought we should give you another chance.  Now, a few disclaimers.... as a newer place I think you are still trying to work out the kinks and there was nothing particularly awful in our dining experience that led to my disappointment- it was just a consistent level of "ok".  Almost everything was just......meh.  The wine was ok, too acidic and not what we were looking for.  We tried a variety of mini plates, stuffed mushrooms, desserts, and sides.  For the most part everything was ok.  We did love the various creme brulees and the mac and cheese (although I couldn't taste any truffle oil).  However, the sauces were cold and lacked depth.  Furthermore, the chocolate dream dessert was bland and my fudge and bundt cake was as hard as a rock.... for $8 (not $3) I was far more in love with my friend's dessert that was a mere $3.  For the cost of the food and drinks.... I expected a lot more.  Furthermore I agree with other posters that there is a lot going on here... that was the only overwhelming part of my experience.  I might give you another try in a month or so as your creme brulee and mac and cheese was delicious.  I hope you work out the kinks as you are exactly what the west side could use a dose of.
0	8UtlNtaAXGgLZgxmgt7IrA	Prices and portions are a little better than Jamba Juice, and food selection is decent.  Went by late last night, I  got one of their superfood smoothies- the Mean Green(?), with kale and spinach and mango and pineapple. Get it with Splenda to save some cals, and the smoothie is a meal at 380 cals. Very filling, very tasty, very sweet.  Joined their website and got an email for a 99 cent smoothie with purchase of a sandwich or wrap. Before I got a chance to even print that up, another coupon came up for TODAY- $1.99 for their curry chicken salad or wrap, and it's decent. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but coupons and deals seem to come around often.   EDIT: Apparently this location's management is now picking and choosing when to honor the company website coupons. I understand franchises are able to opt out of promotions, and the small print always states "at participating locations", but if they honor one they should honor all. And with all of the smoothie competition they have in this area, and my observations of the amount of business they do, they can't really afford to be turning away customers. I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on- getting turned away for a $2 discount coupon that is ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE was a total waste of my lunch break today (3/26/14). If you're going to benefit from the advertising your host company provides, you need to honor their discounts as well.
0	tZYkxIF5VBx4VVXhIRk6OA	Ate there for dinner tonight. The restaurant was very crowded and the wait was more than 15 minutes after you left your bowl at the grill to be cooked. The food in the buffet line looked old.  The broccoli was not florets but rather tiny, tiny pieces. The green beans looked like they were out of a can and the quality of everything was average at best. Two of us for dinner, one time through and 2 ice teas for $28 seems a bit much for fast food. If we are looking for Mongolian BBQ we will stick with YC's.
0	5RgDyel5Um4wC3ZfGbVYg	I've haven't done a review for T-birds yet?  That's crazy!  I wind up at this place at least once a week it seems.  Breakfast is okay.  Most of the breakfast food tastes a little bland.  They have chicken fried steak, ham, eggs, omelettes and other stuff.  Nothing ever impressed me much.  There are quite a few good things for dinner though.  The stromboli is humongous.  I have been dared to eat the large one before, and have failed.  I think I can do it if I give it another chance though.  I just need to not eat for 3 days beforehand.  I finished off a large stromboli with a friend and the bartender was impressed as even with two people it's a lot of food.  In addition to being enormous, it's also quite tasty.  The nachos are pretty good.  Large servings on that as well.  The wings are great.  I prefer the teriyaki and the hot wings.  Pro tip: get the hot wings seared.  Rueben sandwich is good.  Clam chowder in a sourdough bowl is a disappointment.  The bread tastes rubbery and is a bit on the small side.
0	5wlqGNV4Py502W6RJGmWg	I know being a girl this may seem biased, but this food was terrible.  I work in construction and went in with about 20 upper management guys and myself ( I am management). I have a good sense of humor and can hang with the best of them, I go to places all the time with barely clad girls due to the industry I work in... The table I was sitting at hardly touched their food and they were not at all impressed with the "atmosphere".   I can see where the draw is....I was not at all impressed either were most of the guys I was with. The talent was not that great. I would say C-team. Our waitress was not all that intelligent either, she messd up our order and we had to remind her to get our drinks...
0	25XKYv3M3c0nmd399Jl1xw	Enrico's is what is right about Pittsburgh and is a must do on a Saturday afternoon and every first Friday of the month. The owner, Larry, is the quintessential host, the food is fresh and local and the staff truly care about making your experience a great one. Chef, Kate Romane, who typically prepares the First Friday dinners, other parties and off site catering, uses only the best ingredients and somehow makes every dish comforting yet different enough that you will never forget it. The atmosphere is beautiful and rugged and is like no other in the 'burgh.
0	BxTVYBLPFkeoD1L9RgltFg	I've been to Chasers numerous times over my time in Madison. Gotta say it's one of the best pure bar experiences in the area. You can pretty much feel safe that any night you head out on the town there will be a decent crowd there.   On top of that they have a great selection of bar food. My favorite night to go there food-wise would have to be Wednesdays. Can't really beat their taco deal; $.75 hard shell tacos, $1.25 soft shell, and they're better than Taco Bell, so there's that.   All in all, it's tough to say anything bad about this place.
0	KjSPdxKHkUOgu9xAOY4g	As a fan of all things BBQ and a resident of the Elizabeth neighborhood, I was thrilled with Midwood opened. I wish my enthusiasm for the the place could have been maintained following my 3 meals there.  The food is on point over all. My only real beef is with the BBQ beans which lack the sweetness and bacony flavor that I expect with BBQ beans. There's are mushy and taste too much of green and red pepper for me. The 'cue is solid from the sandwich to the brisket, to the chicken.   Why only 2 stars then? Well, the easiest answer is the service is borderline terrible. While generally friendly enough, they tend to disappear for unacceptably long periods of time and when they do return to grace you with their presence they have usually forgotten something you requested, like a drink refill, or have delivered the wrong food. If you are gonna charge $8.00 for a chopped sandwich I don't think its unreasonable on my part to expect a consistent service to go along with it.   If you ask me, they seem all too aware of their owner and his other success and are resting on their laurels a little bit too soon.
0	OyUoPvoJEWFIJbhyPEnHdA	This is a great place to go out and eat. Their is quite a bit to see when you sit down. From all the cars, vehicles, and other things they got hanging from the ceiling, or glued to the wall. It is normally really loud inside, which can get a bit bothersome when your trying to talk to friends or family, and it sucks when you get placed in the bar area, and some people can be very rude and careless (you can tell when their gettin' drunk) besides all that, their is a nice selection of food to choose from, and everything is great. Now, wings are not my thing but Quaker Steaks are pretty good. Although i will never push myself to try the Atomic sauce, because i hate hot... If you in the Madison/Middleton area and want some good food at a good price, you should check out Quaker Steak....
0	DMPfcRrBZ03DZI04yiJwlQ	Review is for the store/market part of Siena.  I used to come here for their great ricotta. Thought it was Polly-O. They have huge gallons of it you can buy. I just picked up a small deli container. Bring it home - its not Polly-O (wat?!?) flavorless, runny and nowhere as good as the ricotta I got from them at their eastside location. Not sure what's up with that, but from now on I'm getting my (Poly-O) ricotta from the Roma deli on Spring Mtn. Also picked up a, $8 ball of mozzarella. No flavor. What's up with the cheese situation here, Siena. Italian and their cheese are supposed to be top notch, no excuses. At least make your own mozzarella in-house. Come on.    I have ordered their grilled eggplant sammie before (again, from their eastside location) and it was great. Will report back at some point if its still quality on this side of town.   Overall not too happy with my $$$ purchases from the fresh deli side of the house.
0	F3KGOmLdis6WcH9aMNSYwQ	Really great soul food in a friendly atmosphere. Don't let the exterior scare you away. It's definite "hole in the wall" greatness. I mean they have Kool-Aid on the menu for god's sake! All of the drinks are served in cool Mason jars. How awesome is that?!  The fried chicken is a must-get. Try dipping it in honey for an extra special treat. I drove 15 minutes out of my way to come here and I'd do it all over again.
0	3iPThtz5GnWBi34eTOe4A	AWESOME decor- serious effort has been put into this place!  The pink tacos were delicious.  Wait staff was so so.  It seems like the larger your group, the slower the staff is.  A con is that I'm ALWAYS cold when I'm in there.
0	4KNaEktMCVgJ6dFFaFtDQ	I love Hot Dog Heaven 'cause they are a mom and pop shop with excellent food! Just writing this makes me crave one of their cheese dogs. Everything I've ordered from here is tasty. From the good old Chicago Dog to the Chili Cheese Fries you can't go wrong! The poppy seed bun is moist and perfect. If you want authentic Chicago Dogs and Italian Beef you will not be disappointed.  Make sure you bring cash because they do not take plastic. They are a walk up style place and have a couple tables outside or you can eat at the counter. If your craving a hot dog check this place out! Its a rare gem in Henderson!
0	0s3Qlq2ScBej6NVhSbvig	I went to this Kobe Sushi location last night, and I was impressed.  The sushi tasted excellent and was a fresh as the previous location.  The crazy Jalapeno roll is one of my favorites, but they have a great menu.  The sushi rollers know what they are doing and they're willing to adapt to your order wants.  The place is clean and the service is great. 50% off all sushi and sake during the late night hours. Around $20 a person for five people and myself to stuff ourselves and drink our bodyweight in sake; nice!
0	aLsnKm1dx7Z3wt9jGJbeag	I have been eating at Michael Mina when it was Aqua. In addition to having eaten at Michael Mina Las Vegas I have eaten at Michael Mina San Francisco at the Westin St. Francis and Aqua in San Francisco. The Las Vegas branch is consistently good (having had about twenty dinners) but the San Francisco branch is consistently better. Located in the Bellagio it is a quite nicely decorated and most of the service staff and management has been working since it opened in the Bellagio many years ago. Keep in mind the style is French although it is considered a Seafood restaurant. Most of the diners are thirty and up and it isn't a casual restaurant. You also may find that tables are fairly close similar to a bistro. Extensive wine list. Reservations are highly recommended. No matter Michael Mina is one of Las Vegas's top five for seafood
0	1frWCvH38WMD71pwF4fw	I finally tried the Cancun Enchiladas which has cheese, scallops, shrimp, pico de gallo and Cancun sauce.  I thought I died and went to hangover heaven.  Wow.  It was absolutely delish.  Simple, but tasty.    The banana crisp dessert was NO joke.  The servers always recommended it, so I finally tried it.  It's almost cheesecake meets banana pudding with nilla wafers.  Very gooooood.
0	4VzioNAh47tgqzuRQGDw	Tried this place last summer in an attempt to end a bout of Chipotle-going.  Yeah, I drank the Chipotle koolaid for a bit (I'm better now, thanks).  Anyway, I read all the great reviews of Poblano and went for some takeout.  Read that the owner came from Tex Tubbs (which we love) and hoped for great food in a more authentic Mex style.  What we got was little tacos made of dried-out tortillas, filled with dry and chewy fillings.  I was the only one in there, the dining room was totally empty, yes, right at dinner-time, and it STILL took them something like 20 minutes to put my order together.  The whole time, I felt like I was interrupting them by ordering, one of my real pet peeves about any business.  We had, as I recall, the El Pastor, the Chorizo, the Asada, and a veggie taco.  All the meats were rubbery and dry, and the tortillas tasted a week old, stale and lifeless.  Good thing I asked for hot sauce before I left.  I ended up using all of it just to moisten the damned things.  I highly doubt I will ever go back.  I gave two stars because the onions and cilantro were good!
0	AiyyRAovfP6NFRzJTWlSA	Yea... I wasn't impressed. The two stars that I'm giving are for the good looks of the restaurant, which can be an important factor, but it does nothing for the tastebuds.  I ordered the tacos with barbacoa and it fell so short of my expectations. First of all, I thought tacos were supposed to be warm; if I had wanted cold food, I would've gotten sushi. Then the guacamole came out so runny and oily that it started dripping onto my plate. I wonder if that's  just a different genre of guacamole or they just cheaped out on avocado. The braised beef tasted okay, I guess, but I wouldn't be raving about it. In summary, the tacos weren't great and I'm not going back.
0	DcWAH1Ip8XSJJIlBkz2V5g	No one at a firing range complains that  even though their Smith & Wesson shoots straight, they don't like it because its Americanized and not an authentic Yangzhou fire lance.   Likewise, no one save latent racists or separatists judge food based on some vague notion of "authenticity."   That being said, Manuel's is tasty, low priced inauthentic Mexican food served in a comfortable environment with the most consistently friendly service of any restaurant I've been to in Phoenix.
0	kucWiCKhql6HyT5g3ZdZQ	Moved to Mesa 4 years ago. Just ate here for the 1st time today. Wish we had found this place sooner.  The carne asada was really good - tender and we'll seasoned. My husband had a machaca and egg burrito which he said was delicious. The dining area wasn't dazzling but the tables and the floor were clean. The kitchen looked clean as well. The service was fast and friendly. Paid less than $20 for a whole bunch of food. Would eat here weekly if it was closer to our place. The owner said they have been in business for 10 years. That's saying something for a "hole-in-the-wall" type of joint.
0	BspAnI89Cjjs6txvCiBtA	I liked this restaurant VERY much. This is where I watched USC beat ASU for the Pac 10 championship of 2009!  And with ASU fans in the house!  They have a DAILY happy hour!!  Draft Bud Lights are like 2 freakin dollars! And all their appetizers (nachos, jalapeno poppers, etc) are all half-off. We got the nachos, and BOY were they loaded!!!  Ground beef, cheese, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, tomatoes... mmmm!!    So we were like 3 of 5 people who were there on a Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m. but around 5ish more people started filling in. They also have this live band set-up but they weren't on when we were there.   So it's a great spot to be to watch a game (oh they also have soccer via satellite) and have a couple beers.
0	KPvpivKKmcrsxjM0CouUEA	Is it possible for two people to be full for less than $8? It is for my sister and I. We came in search of some delectable pupusas and came out stuffed. The complimentary basket of chips with cojita cheese set us in the right direction, giving us something to munch on while we look over the large menu.  We had ordered a plate of plain plantains and they are very generous for $2.50. We had six large pieces of fried bananas and they were searing hot. It did not stop me from shoving them into my mouth though. Next were our our two pupusas; one cheese and squash blossoms and one cheese and beans. Both were good, but our favorite was the latter. The cheese crisps up better and compliments the creaminess of the beans well. At $1.50 a piece we were almost full. The pork tamale was the item that pushed us over. It is not something we would jump to order again. At this point we could not eat anything else.  I have been in search of a place to eat after a night of drinking around this side of town. I would recommend coming here for a quick and inexpensive bite.
0	BSdNlywi5h6ySpTjQcg	I'm giving this place two stars because the concept is a great idea. Great for people who don't have time to cook. However, I have lost respect for this company when I was blatantly lied to by a few people at two different locations. As someone with a degree from ASU in Nutrition/Dietetics I of course asked what the credentials are of the "nutritionists" who work here. The girl told me she has a degree in nutrition from ASU. I was told the same thing at the location in Scottsdale. I suspected it was a lie so I called to speak to someone in management and they finally admitted that no one  who works there has a background in nutrition.   I would advise anyone considering buying meals from here to be aware of the high sodium content of their meals but more importantly realize how unprofessional and unethical it is to lie about credentials. When someone tells you that they are a "nutritionist" always ask what their background is as this is very different from someone who s a "dietitian". Don't let them dupe you. Like I said the concept is good but they could use a little work in business ethics.
0	fJtVJzVstfjWwpi1WiejQ	Twice, schmice.  Can't do it.  Can't go here twice.  First off - what they say is true.  We pulled in at 6:00 on a Saturday evening in south Scottsdale to an empty parking lot.  They had exactly one other table inside.  Scary, but we did it anyway!  The pizza, I will say, was really, really good.  That being said, it is enough for a party of 2-3, which is not clear on the menu.  ALSO, this is supposed to be a dipping bar - which has nothing to do with pizza, really.  The skewers my husband ordered he said were GOOD, but, again, not dippable.  (Are we missing something here?)  For an app we had the Dorito potato skin thingies.  Not... good.  Sorry, just not good.  Actually, we didn't even eat all of them they were so yucky.  The dipping sauces WERE good... we just wished we had something to dip in them!  The drinks... ahhhh... the drinks.  Let's see... If I wanted to pay $10 to have lawn shavings in my mouth - they were fantastic!  I get that I ordered a weird martini, but typically people do not like chunks beyond chunks of stuff in their beverages - which is exactly what this was.  Not flavored... but literally "bits filled."  For dessert (yes, we kept going my fellow Yelpers!  We were trying to find the light in the lime!!!!!  ha ha!) we had the creme brulee.  It should be nearly impossible to RUIN what was probably a good creme brulee.  But no, oh no, they found a way.  They poured booze ALLLLLL over it... and lit it on fire!    Creme brulee, for those who don't know, has caramelized sugar on top.  You should have to crack it with a spoon to get through to the deliciousness hidden below.  Instead we had a bowl of creme brulee soup... swimming in alcohol.  We paid, we tipped, we ran, we won't be back.  Sorry, Limelight.  Pay to upgrade your tables and turn into a fondu place like your name sounds.  Then order some snacks and tasteys that we can DIP!
0	JQmnpli2xmO4sgSmZjWGg	To be honest with you, I have not actually had gelato from Gelato Spot. But, their espresso is to die for! It is so smooth and delightful. I live near Old Town and was looking for a morning coffee spot. The starbucks on Indian School & Scottsdale is far to stressful in the morning. My morning coffee is mean to be to relaxing, and an easy process. Not people shouting in parking lots,and impatient people in lines. So, I was at Gelato Spot studying ( it is ideal for that) and I noticed they open at 7 AM. Therefore, Gelato Spot is now my morning stop for coffee! Thank you GS for making me delicious coffee everymorning!
0	7Jzfq0DWeK7kZ8NOipmSVA	This place is pretty great and it doesn't hurt that it is walking distance from my apartment. Really good food with more variety than normal bar food.  Great beer specials.  There is a band that plays Thursday nights and they mostly do covers of songs that are fun to sing along or dance to.  And...they have NTN.  What more could you want?
0	IxQHFcszyZdOhEFVzPTtkg	For 3 am, this place is pretty busy. We had to wait 15 minutes just to get seated. Once inside, the place has the vibe of Denny's. Waiters and Waitresses that are punching the clock and mildly pleasant. A variety of twenty something at different levels of intoxication. And slots ringing just outside the front of the restaurant. I went there for the prime rib; and as I remember it, it was pretty good for the price. Take a look at the picture for a close up.
0	jKUyCspHf3KZZT8tnZazpg	Overall stellar food! It's kind of odd that it's connected to a Subway in a strip mall but who really cares. My wife ordered a wild mushroom pizza that she couldn't finish, I had ribs that literally fell off the bone (never touched my knife, I swear!) and we had a beef satay appetizer that had a red wine reduction and crispy fried onions. If i'm on death row they may have to package some of those up for my last meal.  My wife was happy to find a great wine selection. The service was very upscale and attentive. I can say that it was a very pleasant experience. The bill was a tad hefty but it's not like they hide their prices. Overall it's a VERY nice place for a date or usefull if you want to take your wife out because you did something stupid.  So I hear...
0	PUJUa1Da9jtHQjv40gx4g	I've had the hot dogs at the location inside the Venetian. Maaaan are they good! This time around, I had more of a craving for fries and chicken than a hot dog. Since it was located in the hotel I was staying at, I visited twice. I ordered the chicken tenders with fries the first time and  a regular sized bacon and cheese fries the second time. Everything was good, but  I couldn't get myself to finish at least half of it...both times! I think it's because their fries are cut pretty thick. They filled me up in no time flat. Next time I get something from here, I'll be sure to have someone to share it with. Except a hot dog. I'd like that for myself, please.
0	i6wpbQH5hvwthc43jSqEWA	This place was recommended by the host of our hotel so we gave it a try.  Hmmmm..... well not really impressed. You enter into the bar area which was loud and crowded, which of course is fine.  The dining part is on farther into the building and in a cavernous room with booths around the edge but only a few tables in the middle.  It looked weird.  I ordered ribs which were extremely fatty.  However, the baked beans were delicious.  The chicken noodle soup was barely warm.  My husband had the chicken fried steak which he said was just OK.  He had the salad which also was boring.  All in all not a great experience.
0	h641ddcG20timj05a2aj2Q	Okay.... I wanted something homey and hearty to eat last night all in my lonesome. I decided for something I haven't had in a long time, but also something worth my money.   Decision? Maui zaui pizza at round table for one please! This flavorful, mouthwatering, scrumptious, sliced-up, oven baked creation is still to this day one of my favorite top three and go eat when I need cheering up food. Maui zaui alone deserves four stars. Makes me wanna dance sitting on my couch with every bite I bite. Haha. Mix it with chicken wings, coke and a funny show or movie and you have just been cheered up. Sooo cheered up that I woke up this morning inspired to write my first review.   Only reason I didn't give round table the so easily given fifth star is because they need to jump on the van wagon and make some deals for customers the same way pizza hut has ten dollar large pizzas. Maybe then they wouldn't have so many round table's in town closed and receive 'woohoo! As good as it gets!' ratings. Thanks for reading! =]
0	gs8P4ahjzReRwIFlswGxHQ	There is no doubt that the foods is good. The cooker is Chinese. Not like other Chinese restaurant, they are Mexican cooker.   The service is slow and tea taste like unfiltered water. Week day is the best time to eat there. Otherwise, it's crowed sometimes. Not a place for take out and fast dinner, but good for a group of people having long dinner.
0	kJQVJUr0Fs63YXXMXfeuYQ	This is good pizza!  My roommate and I love this place.  The toppings are fresh and delish! They also have great fried zucchini, and starter salads.  Just fresh and no messing around.  And the people who work here are super nice!    I would highly recommend this place! Eat up!    My only gripe is that they close kinda early (I think by 8 pm).
0	NEm28Xk3EZKIv3maxi9Nbw	I will keep this short, there was nothing famous about this experience.  Got two pies, pepperoni / mushroom & chicken / spinach - all four toppings had the look / taste / texture as if they'd been pulled out of a can.  The red sauce was too sweet - and this is not what one wants on a savory pizza pie.  Sorry Frankie, not impressed & won't be ordering from you again.  The end.
0	57FiugRigE3Pwj5nhQS6g	I went in on a whim because the line for Subway was so long and the prices looked so good. I ordered a hamburger with potato wedges and a drink. Everything was less than $5 with tax, fantastic!  That said, when I got my food, I was less than impressed. The potato wedges were okay, not really my style, I prefer fries, and if there are wedges, I prefer smaller ones - these were giant - but they were pretty decent for what they were.  The burger though, was GROSS. The patty was clearly a frozen patty that was cooked at some point - I'm 99% sure it wasn't right before I ate it though because it tasted and had the consistency of something sitting under a heat warmer forever.  The staff was polite, but I will probably not be back to give it a second chance - even at these prices. I'd rather pay a little more and get real food.
0	iMc9a99aXihonsXMJzNfhw	The place is decorated nicely, the hibiscus iced tea is wonderful and the wait staff are attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, the food is overpriced, the buns are really dry, and basically it felt like a pretentious version of Blu Burger Grille.
0	Rt1kw5H5Q7AjCw6T3BSGVg	Out of two coffees, one was fine and the other came out tasting burnt and disgusting. Staff was lackadaisical, not sure why I tipped at all if you're going to set my drink on the counter furthest away from where I'm sitting and not even call my name-- I don't expect you to walk out to me necessarily, but if I am literally your only customer and you can't be bothered to do the bare minimum, maybe you shouldn't be open.
0	svwW1NBlboQ3u9eqSaQVw	This place has stuff I can't get anywhere else and even has some gluten free flours & pastas.   I came here looking for Besan (chickpea flour) and walked out with $30 in chocolate & olive oil in addition to the flour I was looking for.  I have been back a couple more times for cheese and french soda.  I love that I can get food I miss from my travels!
0	PDihtADftVOTyP6yfm4RLg	The wait staff here was literally fighting over tables. One waitress was crying. The Spanish speaking waiters and waitresses where making fun of the non Spanish speaking waitresses. Very unprofessional. Food was good. Just not a great environment to eat in
0	YbpEa75tlFpqNLvLQxdg	ADOBO FRIED RICE.   Came here with folks on the way out of vegas. price is right and food is on point. tastes just like i came from a family party (filipino style family party) and decided to get creative with the leftovers. thats how the adobo fried rice omelet  came about. soooo good. shared a adobo and katsu with lumpia and it was enough for 3 people!!! (have it be we each ordered the adobo fried rice omelet to our selves not know the size of the portion.)  better than L&L but ranks up there with Homesyle Hawaiian out here in san diego. (MO dont worry i still prefer you over these guys)
0	MJHMhAMIL33p6frcEqscFw	A disappointing experience. There appeared to be only one employee working during the lunch rush, since there was one employee running orders and making food at the same time.  Service was thus very slow. Near the end of my order I could see another employee on the phone in the back.  The Big Mary sandwich had a delicious chicken breast but the bun was overly steamed and not crispy or toasted.  I asked for their awesome potato wedges but instead received regular, undercooked, bland fries.  I expected better.
0	jNDp6owYDRH8NOQDSd9SXg	Some of the best hot subs in Vegas.  No matter what you decide on it's always the way you want it.  The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before.
0	5mu967R5S70ddQEBnb7jkQ	Yummy...and healthy. Unless of course you eat all of the white rice. They do offer brown though. Everything I've had here has been awesome, and I've tried almost everything on the menu. They have this tasty blackberry jasmine tea as well. I wish the owners of this location would take over the Grand Canyon location and the Ft Apache/Russell, cause both of those locations blow.

There was nothing on the list that you would not find in your average wine store. Largest flight pours I have come across. I want to taste not guzzle. Add to that the price and I know who Beaudevin is trying to emulate but they have a long way to go.
0	A737TETd6BeFAFGgbCoPGw	Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant isn't located in the best area - but it's worth going by anyway because they have some pretty good stuff there!  My favorite is the Banh Cuon Nem Chua Cha Lua $7.99 (Rolled rice cakes served with pickled pork ball and steamed pork.)  It's so tasty, especially when you dip it in the accompanying fish sauce concoction.  I actually find myself craving it, and to me, that's a good sign!  They have Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) for $2.75, which is a steal! I have yet to try their version, but you'll probably find us here grabbing a couple to go the next time we have a flight out.  The BF loves their Ca Phe Sua Da $3.23 (Vietnamese Iced Coffee with Milk).  They don't have it brewing at your table though like other Vietnamese restaurants.  It'll come in a plastic to go container with shaved ice, but it's pretty creamy.  Apparently they do more than use that Cafe Du Monde coffee to make theirs.  (We asked!)  Their Guyabano Shake (with or without Pearls) $3.49 is pretty yummy too.  They do have your standard pho noodle soups and grilled pork chops, but also some unique things like pork blood in rice porridge or vermicelli noodles served with escargots.  Service is nothing to rave about.  It's pretty slow there.  The times we went, there was only one person manning the register, making beverages, cleaning the tables, and bringing the food out.  (There's someone else in the kitchen making the food though.)  So, don't come here if you're in a rush, unless you want it to go.  Overall, come to Pho Thanh Huong for some decent Vietnamese food that won't break the budget.
0	TucH1RGoooTEqaapBgUcg	I've been loyally eating brueggers bagels since I moved to Pittsburgh, but in the last few months service has plummeted. I wait for at least 15 min when there is one person in front of me, and nobody seems to know what is going on. I'm very disappointed and will likely be converting to Einstein
0	AggcavEFylv8xZ2M6lzlVQ	Five Guys, like Smashburger, is based around a marketing plan that involves intentionally high prices and telling the customer they are receiving a higher quality product.  On one hand, the fries are great, even if they are your sodium intake for the month. The burgers, on the other hand, are so-so. Not bad, mind you, and they are definitely fresh and custom made. They're just not that great. They remind me of something I would pull off of the grill in the backyard.   For the money, I'll just go to In-And-Out, save a few bucks, and get a better burger. Still, if you've never been, you should check them out at least once if for no other reason than the fries and awesome soda machine.
0	Ba7ut0Fr6TIsBTXEXdmuw	Went here for lunch recently and the prices were decent for a casino and when I ordered coffee they brought a full thermos and left it on the table for me. So... of COURSE, my amped up self is going to give this place a good review. The grilled shrimp salad I had was good and just big enough for a lunch entry. Eggs Benedict were about an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Atmosphere was loud enough for my kid to sing and not really be heard.
0	Cb5Y0gAQZtmAXjgJVRYWA	I am so sad to write a bad review for this place. I was so excited to try this place. The staff was very nice and friendly and fast. However the food was a different experience. The chips are tasty, the salsa and "hot" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =(
0	wrhHAfy4mHc2PB7ifdPZw	Nutella, bananas, chocolate- I know I shouldn't start with dessert, but their crepes are so good I can't resist. Everything here is good, the patio is great, the owners are on site and very friendly.
0	NvtkmuFzive5eodjhxapZw	Good little place, although not the most accommodating when accompanied by a handicapped person.  We had to wait a considerably long time given that my friend was on a rented rascal scooter due to a fractured foot.  Aside from the long wait (almost an hour) to be seated, the service once at the table was well timed and friendly.    The food was good - as a person who's not the most liberal when it comes to trying new things, I was satisfied with the "gringofication" of the food - I could have used more cheese, but again, that's really the white girl coming out in me.  My companions were wowed by their margaritas, as was I, and the nachos and steak were excellent.  I personally opted for a combo plate with a taco and tostada and both were very good.  I'd go there again if given the chance.
0	op9wPMXNElmuVVawTCUftw	We decided to try this place out as we had received a mailer for AYCE dinner for less than $20 a person; however, when we got there, they were having a special of $16.95 a person, so we nixed the coupon.  We did have to give our information to get the special pricing (i.e., name, address, etc.), so of course I gave fake information.  The place was a little weird; the location (next to Sonic) is not ideal and there is a smoke shop inside also.  I have never seen a smoke shop in a sushi restaurant, especially in such a small restaurant.    The sushi selection was not expansive.  The iced tea tasted horrible.  The rice was a bit hard/overcooked, but overall, the sushi rolls were edible.  The server/owner was nice, but a little too curious to know how we heard of his restaurant and also proceeded to tell us details about how expensive rent at the restaurant's former location was.  It was a little awkward since no one was there, so we felt like our every move/word was being watched/heard.  Dessert selection was also not great.  While it wasn't a "terrible" experience, I suppose I would rather pay the extra $10 a person and eat at a better sushi restaurant in the area.
0	aqTSjhZacyqKbPatQGBKsQ	Great food but I wouldn't wait in the long lines of students and their parents during visiting weekends. The crepe style pancakes are definitely the best (but make sure you split an order... one pancake each or you'll die of a heart-attack or overly stuffed stomach). The "Morning After" is the best deal... standard breakfast combo, two pancakes, two eggs, and your choice of a meat. If you have a normal appetite and a normal-sized stomach... SPLIT one or two between two or three people. Unless you like left over breakfast.
0	aWX75xL3MK47q5iOYbACwQ	A serious foodie restaurant just off the courtyard garden in the Venezia wing of the Venetian hotel.  It has a bustling, no nonsense, bright, noisy, food lover's tone to it.  That puts off some tourists who expect that a fine restaurant has to be quiet, velvety, dark, and formal.  But if you know what you like it can be good here.  What I like is oysters.  Lots of them.  So while my cohort slept in the room I snuck down for a baker's dozen with some bread and sancerre on the side.  The place was booked solid all night, but like most restaurants of its ilk it has a large unreserved bar section so that solo diners and couples can usually slip right in.  Personally, I brought my laptop and cell phone to work on a business presentation -- but in deference to people who think that paying lots of money for good food means a certain level of decorum, I put the laptop discretely on the banquette next to me rather than the table.  How can one place's raw shellfish be any better than another's?  Is it the selection, the storage, the presentation?  Sauce?  Temperature?  Whatever it is, their oysters, half a dozen tiny gourmet varieties from the Oregon and Washington coasts, were out of this world delicious.  Service was ridiculous.  Slow, they forgot the oyster spoons, had to ask twice for bread, etc.  And it was in-your-face personal quirky, California style.  But it was, strangely, professional.  You know they know what they're doing, even if they're not doing it for you at the moment.  At the end, without my prompting, the waitress gave me two free oysters and apologized, said that they were far busier tonight than they were expecting.  And the oysters, a little pricey, but they were really, really good.
0	HL0DeirjRNtMJuypxc4Aw	I was pretty surprised at how much I liked this place. I have lived in the neighborhood for 5 years or so and never tried them. I am not sure what deterred me other than maybe the name. Ballpark just doesn't instantly trigger thoughts of great pizza for me... I will readily admit I was wrong though!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and 20 wings. The wings were big and meaty and I thought they had a great flavor. The ranch wasn't my favorite ever, I am guessing it may have not been made in house, but I could be wrong. Ranch aside though these were some damn fine wings IMHO. The pizza came out a few minutes after the wings and I was blown away at how good it was. The crust was thin and crispy, which I absolutely love. My only complaint is that I burnt my mouth because I was not patient enough to wait for it to cool! I know, I know - that isn't Ballpark's fault so I won't dock them any stars. This place is a solid choice for some pizza and wings! I will try them again soon!
0	QdDfAYmS6whQoL3Foje1Tw	Quik Chinese? Not so much...I've been here twice and both times I have had painfully long dining experiences. The first time I ate at QC at least the food was decent (hence the 2-star rating), this second time around everything was terrible.  First mistake = coming here on Christmas Day (around 5:30pm) - but I had nothing at home to eat, and there weren't many dining options open except for Chinese. George & Son's had a 50 minute wait, and we were quoted 20 minutes at QC so we decided to eat here.  We walked in to a fairly full restaurant, and our first red flag should have been the sight of the staff (all 5 of them) frantically running around, except for a young 10-year old girl who was seating guests....  It took quite a bit of time to get our drinks and appetizers out to the table but the real disaster came with the time we had to wait for our entrees. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entree plates, it had to be at least 45 minutes. In that time we saw multiple tables get up and leave due to not having any service, which at first was amusing, and then turned to annoyance.   Repeatedly there was a gentleman (who seemed to have come into the restaurant to help his buddies during dinner service because they were so backed up) who told tables, "sorry folks, we didn't think we'd be so busy today!" Well - it is Christmas, and you're the only restaurant open...c'mon man.  When the food finally got to our table, the same gentleman came with the plates and said to us, "Does this look like the food you ordered?" Uhh, what!? You tell me guy, you're the one who works here...plus almost all Chinese food looks the same, so, sure?  The last straw was that the food was terrible, cold, and unappetizing. Poor marks all around. Running a restaurant when you're slow is easy, a true mark of a decent restaurant is managing and being capable when you're busy.  I know its Chinese food, but still, let's keep some sort of standards here folks. You know it's bad when you leave saying, "We should have just eaten at Taco Bell." Too bad they were closed.
0	hg6pOmhN2qtGXk7kpxQ5mQ	A new Asian super buffet going in a vacant Black Angus Steakhouse? I'm there! There's got to be at  least one establishment open for business along Southern Avenue from Alma School to Longmore. For this review, I feel it will be best to list pros and cons about my experience on a recent Saturday evening...  Pros:  Attentive Hostess/Wait Staff; Unique Decor, Large selection of food choices available, separate price for children; real ice cream (as opposed to that frozen ice milk that most Asian buffets serve (wtf is that?)); Spacious floor plan to accomodate a large number of patrons as well as ease in navigating the different stations  Cons: Is the use of 3 different styles of chandeliers intentional? I kind of like consistency, otherwise it looks like you've outfitted your establishment from Goodwil finds.  Speaking of consistency ... If you're going to label SOME things, label EVERYthing. Most things I could figure out, but that makeshift taquito-looking thing looked like it was filled with Steak Tartare rather than taco meat. Which brings me to my next point. I've been to enough of these kinds of establishments and I've been a parent long enough to realize that sometimes there's picky eaters out there, children especially. So if you want to serve Pizza, I may find it a little out of place, but I can let it slide.    What I DON'T get, is the taco station, and the Tapatio hot sauce on the table. True, most Asian buffets are frequented by Hispanic families. I totally get that, believe me, but if an ASIAN establishment with a taco bar is walking a fine line. If it starts serving Horchatas and Tamarindo waters (like I've seen one do), then my natural instinct is to think that they've sold out, or they don't know what they're specializing in and when that happens, they run the risk of having their quality suffer. If Mexi-Chino Fusion is your goal, then brand yourselves as such. That's all I'm saying. Good night.
0	vcOJ7q3PXPEVRIxjXyiQzw	Good service,  and they had decaf coffee ready (not instant or lattes only like most MTL places); toast was excellent, but the eggs, potatoes,  and pancake were just "ok". "Fruit" was laughable, more like garnish.
0	73oNKrzKu2AOjntQhMwSEA	At the library 'studying' and can't ignore your grumbling anymore?  And by grumbling I mean not just you because you have an exam tomorrow you haven't quite finished reading the text for.  Or attended lecture for the last three weeks.  I'm talking about your stomach!  Well, take that well deserved break and walk yourself down State St. past but not quite past the Taco Bell and straight into Za's where you can quickly grab an order form and a pencil from the counter as you walk in.  Start by putting your name on the top, (And feel free to use whatever's left of your brain cells that the beer didn't get and put down awesome names.  Names like...Optimus Prime.  This creativity will come into play later when they serve up your order by calling out your name which will echo, echo, echo throughout the entire cafe.  You'll probably laugh to yourself because only you know that your name is not really Optimus Prime.)  Next, fill in the bubble in front of whatever item you want or you may customize your own order by simply filling in more bubbles.  This will be the easiest scantron you'll ever fill out in your college career.  You can't fail this like your impending exam the next day.    Although I've only ever had the Chicken Alfredo--that's not to say their pizza and pananis aren't as delectable.  And for the record, I don't know how each time the alfredo turns out so perfect--it's never dry.  I ponder this because the guys behind the bars sure don't look like chefs to me.  They closely resemble those guys who look like they just barely crawled out of bed and tumbled into lecture wearing what they wore to sleep the night before.  Wait...wait, a second--they are the very same guys!  How is this?!  Just, just how is this?!  Oh, I can also attest to their great salads.  Go Greek.  Well, like Lamar Burton always said, "You don't have to take my word for it."
0	Yk1RC3sLNFXhTdiXgfX5nQ	The pizza was good, but that is where the 2 stars comes in.  Now here comes the complaints: the ice maker was jamming and the waitress crammed her fingers in the nozzle to get the ice out and put that ice into our cups.  GROSS.  Secondly, they served us 2 orders of hard/raw potato skins and instead of them removing it from the bill they only took 10% off the order.  Note: Tax in LV is 8.1% so there was no big discount there.  The cheesecake must have been uncovered because it had an aftertaste that was disgusting.  Father's day dinner was ruined and over 50 bucks for a disgusting meal.  I used to love Monte's but we will never go back.
0	L9WVGGVX2GRYk2FQbkc0w	Viva El Taco may just be my new taco hot spot.  Not only is it closer to me than the nearest Roberto's I get my $0.99 chicken tacos from on Wednesday nights but it also has the same special to include Tuesday as well.  That's right, I said Viva El Taco has $0.99 chicken tacos on Tuesday AND Wednesday.  Awesome!  I was there recently and while I did not get the chicken tacos I did get the beef version.  They were pretty darned good.  A lot of beef.  A lot of cheese.  A crunchy shell. I also got my other Roberto's favorite.  3 rolled beef tacos with guacamole.  These are a very close match to what I have craved for many years.  My dad got his standard carne asada burrito.  It was loaded with beef and salsa and no filler.  Just the way my dad likes.  I believe the price was better too. Roberto's has some competition now.
0	W4z6nVL37ep3N9GlgZjyBA	Not sure why I keep expecting this place to get better but it doesn't. Order an app, which showed up after only one of our two entrees appeared 15 minutes after the first entree. Servers are friendly, but this place has a long way to go.
0	B1a9vDDxlBfWGxYTwqo3lw	I wanted desperately to love this little place.  The vibe is awesome, the menu is cool and I love the cuisine.  Here's the thing, nothing was aok besides the beans.  The black beans were good.  I ordered the jerk chicken taco and the cochinita pibil pulled pork taco.  They came with a side of green and red salsa.  Nothing was aok about any of this.  The jerk chicken was kind of grey and didn't have any jerk flavors, it was topped by unripened mango.  It was supposed to be a fresh mango salsa I guess but the flavors didn't mesh and it was just awful.  I tried it with the salsas but couldn't recommend either of these insipid and flavorless imposters.  Were they sitting around too long and did everything need salt?  There was too much wrong with all of it to sort it out.  The pork was ok, there wasn't enough of it.  Neither salsa really complimented it.  It was swallowed by the flavorful double corn tortilla that housed both tacos.  These were obviously made locally and fresh but were heavier than I am used to.  I can't recommend eating here and I will not be back.  Can I go back to Chicago now?  Mexico City downtown was the bomb and I wish they hadn't closed because this was the real deal.  Even if this isn't supposed to be authentic, they still need someone who understands food preparation and this particular cuisine.  Only my warm heart kept me from hitting the 1 star key.
0	ngpV7dRXnSJcKo07m5YBEg	Sorry, not impressed. Went here during the First Friday art walk. Shared a bento box with the fiance. He said spam tasted old, I thought chicken tasted old as well. Noodles was nothing special. We did not finish half of the bento box. No thanks, I will go to have Hawaiian food at Island Flavor instead.

0	QYalM5KuKz28wrjRf6s7Dw	Great place to eat. Great food, great value. People who work there are really friendly and food usually comes out very fast. I love their general tso's chicken, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, and so many others. so stop by, it's going to be worth your money
0	HMRRopi7qpXCHZs5A1yMpg	My husband and I are foodies. He wanted to try this place for quite some time and we finally did the other day. He is a huge BBQ lover and to hear him complain was quite surprising. He kept saying to me all throughout the meal, I want to find something good to like about this place and I keep trying to talk myself into giving it another shot but then I taste the next thing and I'm so disappointed. His brisket was very dry. His ribs were tough and hard to chew. His coleslaw was so unflavorable that he said KFC made much better coleslaw. He even mentioned that the soda machines weren't mixed right and he had a watered down soda. I had the pulled pork and it was very dry as well. I had to soak it in sauce just to eat it. The beans were not that great. The potato salad was pretty decent. The place was almost deserted when we sat to eat our food. A few people came in while we were eating. I wondered why this place wasn't more packed during the dinner hour. We paid $33 for our two plates with sides and a drink. For being a small place in a strip mall, they were highly overpriced for what we got. From now on we will stick with Honey Bears or Joe's Farm Grill for our BBQ.
0	uitAIDlJYaEzWQmyn8Y0Q	The rich wood decor gives you the feeling that 20- and 30-somethings don't belong here...but stay a little while and you'll soon learn that the menu is very modern (Asian-Pacific fusion) and their happy hour specials at the Fusion Bar can make you really happy!   We definitley go for happy hour! The appetizers during happy hour are half-priced (and we're not talking fries and peanuts here!). The menu includes a whopping kobe burger and crab cakes and kabobs that are drizzled with mouth-watering sauces that I can't even pronounce. Well drinks and house wines are 3.5 and draft beers are 2.25. Plus, there's this musician named Ivan who does a mean Lyle Lovett, Counting Crows and even the Beatles (acoustically!).   I consider this place a hidden gem!

0	aiTH5bWL2EsNHTYgtFjRg	Lutece is a French institution. They are famous in culinary lore for being the first to ever charging people $30 for dover sole. At the time, it was considered a trash fish and was not prepared in any major restaurants. Now, dover sole is THE thing to order in any french restaurant pretending to be fine dining.
0	xqno48AYeHdYy1hWQ3H9w	I just went to Red Robin a few months ago. When I walked in I realized WHY I had never been there. It's a family friendly joint - so you never know when little junior will start screaming or running through the aisles. Thankfully, that only happens about 20% of the time I'm there, probably because I'm there on weekdays for lunch.  I have to admit though, they have consistently good food. Not creative, just basic stuff, but tasty. The salads in particular are really great (and I'm picky about lettuce and salad dressings). Plus they'll bring you fries for free - all ya have to do is ask :-)   My co-workers won't let me stop going, but then again I don't fight them too hard.
0	tkfuVUB2IELpgyeMqWfubw	They have really good chips and salsa. The crudo burro was spicy but not too spicy where it takes the flavor of the food.  The carne Asda tacos were ok, nothin to special. The beans were not too good however the rice was tasty.
0	ijvXUFYZfeKUtb3ZmYAPg	subpar. i ordered the philly cheesesteak. the sauce they used was nasty. the bread was good. my wife ordered the bean and cheese and it was much better. we also got a cinnamon/sugar frybread. it was ok. i dunno. overall, it was like fair food but based on the reviews here i was expecting much more . maybe people on this side of town are deprived of good restaurants. :)
0	ZtuABEd5QNagkXMjEJZOQ	Afternoon tea in the Four Season Hotel, Monday-Thursday 3-5pm.  Scones with devonshire cream, strawberry preserves and lemon curd.  The scones are small, silver dollar sized and so flaky and you can ask for more.  The wait staff's attention to detail is very good, I wore black slacks, they gave me a black linen napkin instead of the usual white, so there wouldn't be lint on my pants.  \r 4 different  tea sandwiches and 4 different desserts on a tiered \r serving dish.  Each person gets their own choice of tea.  Around $30. \r Beautiful atmosphere in the Verandah, both dining inside and out, next to the pool.  Downstairs from the main lobby.\r Four Seasons hotel is attached to the Mandalay Bay Hotel
0	ThX45YQDJ08otDZrs67eA	I love the salad - very fresh.  I love the breadsticks with olive oil - nice touch!  The pizza was very good, but I prefer a super thin crust.  Service was wonderful and the atmosphere was brilliant!
0	GcGfsRsZBgCJ5yW3m9yr7A	Went back there yesterday. Service was faster than before, BUT the meat in our burgers was still red in the center.  If their new policy is to serve medium-cooked meat (some people like it), they should make it explicit on the menu or when the waiter/waitress takes orders, because undercooked ground beef can cause diseases.  About 5-10 minutes into our meal: no courtesy check yet. Had to wave the waitress to ask that the beef be cooked some more. She was very nice about it and apologized. Meat still had pink spots when I got it back but I worked around it. Overall burger was still good, fries still OK; I really wished they served green salad instead of coleslaw as a side.
0	6Fhkod1PI0MTXOiTBw9qMA	I have been here twice now, and have experienced sub-par service, and an overcooked omelet.  The first time I went to the restaurant, the place was no more than a couple weeks old. We had to wait for a few minutes to be seated, but that is to be expected, as it is a new establishment.  After being seated and waiting for about 10 minutes, we finally had a server come and introduce herself.  Since we had already sat there for 10 minutes, we were both ready to order, but right after we had placed our drink orders, the waitress just sped off, so we had to wait another 5 minutes. When the server came back, I had ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The food came out about 15 minutes later, and my omelet was burnt, while the potatoes were cold.  I waited for a few minutes, but our server was nowhere in site.  At this point, I had become impatient and just ate the food and chalked it up to it being a new place, and would come back a 2nd time to try it again.  About 2 weeks ago, we finally decided to go back, thinking all the hype should have died down, and we should be able to get some decent service and food.  I was wrong.  We got seated and waited about 10 minutes for a server... again.  This time, we made sure to order the food, and then the drinks.  I ordered the same thing as i did the last time- an omelet.  The food came out while I was in the restroom, so I didn't have a chance to see it while the server was there, but the omelet was burnt... again.  Omelets are supposed to have some yellow to it, but this thing was BROWN.  Anyways, I came back, waited for about 5 minutes, only to see our server playing with a dog on the patio.  This went on for another 3 or 4 minutes, and again, I became a little upset at the fact that we had sat there for so long with minimal service, so I started eating the omelet.  It was a good thing, because she didn't come back until our plates were cleared.  Horrible service, and sub-par food... again.  The atmosphere is really cool, and the location is great.  I love to sit outside and people watch, but I do like to eat a decent breakfast with some service more.  I understand this is the new trendy restaurant in Scottsdale, but its going to lose fast, if it doesn't start taking care of its customers.  There are plenty of other breakfast places in the area that have outstanding service, with better food.  I suggest you look for those places.
0	9FZaWVXvAgyC62ucmyIcWA	We've been meaning to get to this intriguing restaurant for quite a while.  Well, for Valentine's day, while everyone else was jacking up their prices, they were offering a $10 off $30 through Sunday night, so we went one day early and we were NOT disappointed.  The Caprese salad and Antipasto salads were divine.  The Fritti plate which in our case meant half mozza and half zucchini was so fresh!  The mozza literally melted at the touch.  Our entrees were very good as well.  My hubs got the Papa combo which consisted of veal, lasagna and some spinach manicotti.  He said it was spectacular.  My Chicken Saltimbucca was very good but a bit dry for my taste.  I saw many other orders go out that looked very yummy so I'm going to go again and again, working my way around the menu.  The service was excellent with Barbara offering suggestions and helping in any way she could.  Now, this is not the most glamorous place on earth but it's comfortable and you feel like family!
0	CQSwbKgx0FrLpticII7BaA	Walked in very hungry through part of the casino. Brings back memories of Vegas with stale smoke, stale food and very weird people sitting at slot machines. Okay, expected that. Got to whom I thought was the ma\u00eetre d' or host. It was a Saturday night at 7 pm so I thought it might be busy. I asked if we needed a reservation for the steakhouse and he first tried to funnel us down to the buffet. Then he asked in a suspicious tone if we were there for the 7.99 special. "No, we are here for the prime rib," we say. "Oh, I might be able to seat you," says he. Bit obnoxious.  We get in there and the place is almost empty. Was he fishing for a tip? Whatever. I order the lobster bisque and my husband orders the largest cut of prime rib. Five minutes later the waitress come back and says, "I'm sorry, bad news sir. I've just been informed that we are out of prime rib." Really?! Out of prime rib on Saturday night at 7:00 pm ????  This messes things up since we were going to split the large cut. Now what? We order the ribeye with peppercorn sauce. Another five minutes. "More bad news sir." Now if the were out of ribeye, I was leaving then and there. Nope. Out of peppercorn sauce. Fine.  The rolls were stale. The lobster bisque came. Good flavor, but the consistency was like congealed gravy. Too much thickener and no pieces of lobster. they must have used just the stock. Disappointing. Couldn't eat it.  The steak was pretty good. The garlic mashed potatoes were cold and they were missing something:  oh yeah, GARLIC!  If you think I might be nit-picky, check the other 5 reviews I've posted today. They are 5 and 4 star. I see the other reviews. Maybe this was an off night or they just got through a hoard of people, but this was not a good experience.

0	YWXmPEHiksGkbtL5BUarKQ	If you're looking for something a little more sophisticated than the Olive Garden (or O.G. as my best friend and I like to call it!), head out to Cafe Boa for the best Italian food Arizona has to offer. The cafe and wine bar has a variety of delcious pastas on the menu ( I love the Tortellini Brigantino). They also offer a variety of martinis (my favorite is the pomegranate martini). And their illuminated patio makes for a romantic setting for those date nights.
0	nAwMltmx5qTskbzPYmzww	I didn't know what to make of this place after having walked past a number of times, and after eating there, I still don't know.  Service was ok. Our server and hostess were a bit on the awkward side (asked if we had a reservation at 11:30am), but I won't demote anyone for that.  Food was expensive. I would like to try the pizza, but the salads, sandwiches and steaks were just not grabbing me off the menu. There was nothing particularly pittsburgher, which I expected given the name of the place. I settled for a grilled romaine salad, and that's what I got, nothing spectacular.  The atmosphere is quite unique, as many have described, but I would put it somewhere in the vicinity of sports bar meets the jetsons.  I'll go back and give them another chance.
0	tf1k0CJyBXsk6vHF5cMsUw	OK, so I have been t o the original location and it was at least a 3.5. We tried the new location tonight and they definitely have some growing pains. We arrived around six and the place was pretty busy. It just got more busy as the evening wore on. This also happened to be all you can eat taco/enchilada night. Who knew?  The decor is average at best. Some really nice stone work, but lemon yellow walls can use some muting. Laminate flooring speaks to keeping cost down over quality. The tables are already lopsided. Seems like they skimped on the furniture as well.  On to the meal.   I ordered the taco/enchilada pig fest while my wife ordered the carne asada. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive, which was pretty surprising. Carne asada takes like six minutes and they just had to be prepared for the all you can eat menu. In the meantime, the salsa had some bite, pretty good, and the chips were ok. The basket that the chips came in was tiny...think small hot dog basket. And it had no liner....salt all over the table. Again, no big deal, but why not bigger chip style baskets and liners? Seems like another budgetary decision.  The taco and enchilada platter were as expected...about a three. They let the tacos rest in the enchilada sauce making them soggy which is really common. That bed of lettuce is just never enough to keep the tacos safe. I would ask for a separate plate next time. The taste of the food was actually pretty good, though the taco meat could use some pep.    The carne asada was  a huge disappointment. The first iteration came out inedible. It was crispy on the ends and dry on the inside. They cooked us another steak, and it was better, but still well done when she had ordered medium. It was also completely unseasoned...not even a hint of salt, let alone a marinade. They have to nail the basics or they have no shot.   To end on a positive note, the server was polite, if over tasked. The management removed the carne asada meal from the tab, even after making it again. We didn't mention that the second one was over-cooked...why pile on? Extra tip for the waiter.   I hope they can get it going to rival the original because I really am a fan.
0	fo68er5pY3xNzW69LNw53A	Eh. It's alright. Nothing to write home about. Just your usual fake, greasy, been sitting out for probably too long Asian buffet. Not my first choice, not my fifth choice and definitely not even my 10th choice for places to eat. I only eat here because my boyfriend and his family likes this place a little too much lol.
0	wfcIqBIOeUXWbSnoNQJH5Q	I used to be a huge fan of this place when it first opened years ago, but two bad experiences in a row ruined it forever. Sloppy sandwiches are one thing, but an absolute mess is another. Also, if you are going to advertise something as a special, know how to make it! The steak and cheese was advertised as a special, and when i got home and took a bite, the steak was still red in the middle! The outside edges were brown, but the middle was entirely un cooked.  I have heard they are now under new ownership and management, but I dont know that im willing to try again to see if anythings changed.
0	MfU0nlnEGXMyTcW6gndmw	This place replaced the old Pickup Stix, redecorated the place but unfortunately the food isn't authentic nor does it justifies the price.  The server is extremely helpful and friendly. The portions generous but the flavor isn't there.   For $8.50 you have a good array of dinner menus to choose from and for around $5 for lunch. Specials include egg rolls, wontons, soup, choice of rice and chow mein.   I ordered "double cooked pork", it isn't double cooked pork. Rather it is just some veggies bbq pork stir fry. It was very disappointing and they should not have put the name up if the item is not what it's suppose to be.   My friend ordered sesame chicken and it turned out to be orange chicken with about 20 pieces of sesame on one piece of nugget. I'm not exaggerating.   anyway, probably won't be coming back to this place. Quite unfortunate because it has potential and a good service.
0	z5Xq7KuLnMf4bgoU9LA0w	The only positive thing about Bonanno's is its availability after 2am.  Sadly, it's a pretty awful excuse for a pizzeria.  Even Sbarro's would have been more desirable.  Once again, dining by necessity.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]
0	t5O4e73EwM9btuGwl7CgOg	Nice waffle. Hard to digest food in this atmosphere however. The lighting is 6 stark curly compact flourscent bright bulbs augmented by the stark cold lights of a refrigerated case. Too bad it could be cute intimate and inviting. I felt like I was in a Greyhound bus station in the 60s.
0	WtFCsvx0uL8U7kZZgdBShQ	Good food but horrible service. The messed up my order twice. I made an order online and went to go pick it up and they gave me the wrong order. Of course I didn't realize this until I got home but when I called them to let them know, I didn't even get so much as an apology. I asked if they could just have my food delivered since THEY are the ones who gave me the wrong order and I was told I had to drive back to get my food. When I went back, the lady just handed me my food and didn't say anything, she just walked away. The food I did order also had things missing from it but I was tired of waiting to speak with someone. I understand that they may be busy or short staffed but I don't understand the bad customer service.
0	U8R6zXNmZg8Ndf1ycb4j4w	A wall full of taps with enough beers to keep you interested for months at a time. A bottle shop upstairs that all of the good stuff. A menu with the full gamut of Pittsburgh food. Sport on the TV.  Yeah, it's good. What's that, four different varieties of "buffalo chicken" sandwiches? Gigantic deli meat sandwiches with all manners of pork products and names like the "artery clogger"? Humorous in-jokes throughout the menu? Chips? Fries? Only thirteen different kinds of wings? GOSH!  Really, it very well could be worthy of five stars if it weren't for the persistent firesh**s that come with the territory. Oh well, it's still worth it in the end.
0	MBBCBYbmdL3AQqrKw8oNg	Nick's is a small local chain that does a lot of things right. The portions and service are just right, and there's a lot of variety on the menu.   Nick's has a bunch of home made pastas, along with pizza, salads, and appetizers. They have a soup that sort of like a Chinese egg drop combined with minestrone. Try it!   I'd recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, business or pleasure. Don't forget to check the board for the specials and try something new.
0	4cixIuNYaxMUXDxmxlFFg	WORST SERVICE EVER. ONE WAITER - Need I say more. It seemed like the only waiter serving was the owner, which wasn't the biggest problem, I think the kitchen may have had two people in the back, and out front, a full restaurant of about 60 people, prime time Saturday night. When we first walked in, our cue should have been all the empty plates sitting on the table in front of the impatient looking guests. We had ordered a soup and a salad to start which took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive, luckily our mains followed about 15 minutes later. I will say the food was very good, but certainly not worth the wait. Please keep in mind, this isn't fine dinning. After this experience, I am definitely not going back.
0	WxVLiL3Pz8OYaTYRtvaxg	I found this restaurant on Yelp and was excited with such great reviews.  We called and they were booked.  We asked them to give us a call if they got a cancellation and they called with a 730 available time.  They were very pleasant.  We arrived and and had a drink at the bar were seated fairly promptly.  Restaurant had nice atmosphere.    We began with the lobster deviled eggs.  They were definately fresh good for deviled eggs but if lobster wasn't in the name I would not have guessed there was lobster in the dish.    I had the chopped salad and my husband had the dinner salad with balsalmic dressing.  Both were fresh, mine had good flavors.  For our main course I had the lobster mac and cheese (the appetizer left me wanting more lobster) and my husband had the the Hangar Steak.  Mine wasn't at all special not even great for mac and cheese and again minimal lobster and no significant lobster flavor.  My husband really didn't like his steak and although small didn't finish the dish.  Really said the flavor was off.    The waiter recognized my husband didn't enjoy the flavor and was very apologetic.  Although my husband would not have sent it back no one really came by to check if everything was ok until it would have been too late anyway.    The waiter did comp the dessert because of my husbands dislike of his dish and was very eagar to make it right.  My husband ordered the molten lava cake and this was really dry without any real "molten" center.  I don't like to write bad review but this restaurant is way over rated in my opinion.  The staff was very pleasant but they could not make up for the poor flavors in the food.    We will not return.
0	eO7k2opbOHpuBdKWTE6nA	This is a cute little restaurant.  My fiance and I used to live in Texas, so we're pretty hip to authentic Mexican food.  This may not be quite what some are expecting or hoping for in that regard, but their food is pretty delicious.  The service is always good and the restaurant is clean.  Good enough for me!
0	bOxaPT7lPrRmW7tuO4PVOw	the girl friend and i were in need of some sushi and decided to make our way to osaka. i had only been there once before and it was 5 years ago so i couldn't remember how grubbin their dishes were.   we arrived at 3:05pm and i had asked the hostest what time happy hour started? she said happy hour starts at 4:00pm. i then asked if we stayed after 4:00pm, would they honor the happy hour rates for us. she worked it out for us and gave us the happy hour rates and we were out at 4:00pm.  the service was so amazingly great! not too attentive, yet always there when we needed something and super friendly.   we enjoyed: baked muscles cucumbers in vinegar sauce baked scallops kani nigiri veggie fried rice avatar roll - my fav! =) virgin roll  two flavored iced teas  all for $60 yum!
0	4MGZczdhTTnRJFwE8ig31A	I went there today with my kids.  We were a little late for lunch , so we paid dinner price.  This place is clean clean clean!  Brand new!  As for the food,  it was okay .   They had many selections like sushi,steaks,egg roll,  fish and all the other stuff you can find in a regular buffet . Taste was okay , nothing great.  Bottom line,  too expensive for me,   we were charged 35 bucks ,including taxes and  soda.     The kids probably ate 5 bucks worth of food.
0	U7vCiisjTJvdSd89KGPBQ	I would literally be five pounds lighter without their corn and crab chowder. it is so yummy, I almost am going to drive down there right now and order up some. They give you a wonderful roll with it, and it is such a yummy lunch. The atmosphere is so nice, with local art work hanging on their walls and cozy booths to share a long lunch.  Get the Niscoise salad, the steak sammie, or any of their yummy pastas, they are amazing!! Don't forget to stroll around the arts factory after!
0	axR7uyjNu9pUcvCFRHu2w	The picture shown is not the actual cafe. They mostly only had sandwiches. I saw very few pastries that did not look fresh. The sandwich I had was not great for the $9 I paid for it and a small bag of chips. I definitely will not be back.
0	SuyPtpNuaY1NYVu64lv9Q	Not a bad place to go during happy hour.  The philly cheesesteaks are really good.  A pretty good place to drink especially for UNLV students since it's just across the street.  Not as much room as most bars I go to, but the place doesn't ever get overly packed with people.  There are televisions filled with games, service is friendly, and the atmosphere is good enough where I can enjoy talking to my friends without it being too loud.
0	NvzCHPL19SGPwJhyc7zyPA	My bf saw this place and it reminded us of our days of living in San Diego and guess what it was exactly like a sandwhich shop in San Diego - OVERPRICED and not what you expected.  I was very dissapointed in this place to be quite honest with you. It was a regular sandwhich you could make at home, nothing special. The entire time I was wishing I'd ordered something else or gone to Subway, lets be honest. For the same price we could have gotten 2.5 footlongs and had lunch AND dinner for a few days. Ah well. They send coupons in the fliers pretty regularly but I am just not  tempted to go back yet. maybe in the near future I will give them another try.  The best thing about the sandwich was avocado. but I can buy that nxt door @ Albertson's.
0	hiU4nvLAA0Z4ITwwO0ZHXA	Update for AM Breakfast:  Love the attentive service, decent prices, & outdoor patio. The waitress checked on us frequently even though we were having breakfast. The breakfast was very good and the portions were decent. I would rate this place as number 2 or 3 best place for breakfast in the Queen Creek area.
0	9CwRM7osLX1LwWwo9KeLBw	I went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I was very impressed as was my family.  The diner has a really clean, old school look to it.  The menu is huge and everything we've had has been delicious.  My dad particularly love the eclairs!  You can gain about 10 lbs looking at one they are ridiculous.  This our new go-to place for breakfast or dinner.
0	nHUxd6wKt0A0tgXpTTLx1Q	If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner don't do the drive thru. The lines are very long. But if you do the tables or car hop they are fast. They have a good verity of semi health to just dang good food. I like that I can get breakfast all day.
0	w4q3rZm6RM55L2rPS2hgA	every time i have grabbed a snack at this place they have messed up my order and it tasted horrible anyhow.  they also take forever to complete your order. it does not take 20 minutes to make a quesadilla, sorry.  never going here again.
0	1vzWFslRShgtlRd3qwC9w	In a nutshell, I'll never go back to this place. I shouldn't have to chew my coffee...done with coffee grounds in my coffee. The chicken sandwich was pretty disgusting. I work in food service and I'd never serve up food the way it was given to me.
0	HPy3H4WWupTwEj8wkcUk5w	If you need to get your fix of chinese food in vegas...this is the place to come!  The best part about it is that it is open past 3am!  The worse part was that our food took over 30 minutes to come!  I highly recommend getting the Singapore style vermicelli noodles.  Sooooooooooo gooood!
0	xo2Z5Iia8BLJX0CMBv1paQ	Dien Xing or Dim Sum or Little bit of Heart.  Whatever its called, this is a weekend morning ritual that I loves when we were growing up.  Of course it meant getting up at 6 am and out the door and in the car for a 2hour ride to Los Angeles to get into the LA Chinatown and then sitting through my parent's selection of dishes that we kids never really dug, only wanting the bao tze or shrimp har gow, shui mai or the sweet sesame balls.  Now that I'm an adult and moved far away from Los Angeles, I've come to appreciate the dim sum weekends and the strange foods my parents always selected.  The place in Arizona that is a very good place for dim sum is China King.  Saturdays and Sundays starting at 10 and going to about 2 you will probably need to wait a bit before getting a table because a lot of other families had the same idea as you.  But it definitely is worth the wait.  Some great dishes to get are any and all their shrimp dim sum dishes, they sometimes will do other tsong fun type wraps.  Excellent jiao yen you    yu or fried calimari.  Dan Ta or custards are excellent.  The sesame balls are freshly made and crispy and qq at the same time.  Gan Lan tsai or chinese broccoli is well done and perfectly served.   One of the best dishes is their chicken feet or Phoenix claws.  Their version is one of the best I've ever tasted.  Tripe, ribs, and other dishes are also served.  Desserts are available too.  These are the mango puddings, almond jelly, rice sponge, sesame balls and others.   Go with a bunch of friends or bring lots of family because if you go with just yourself and someone else then you really won't be able to sample all the dim sum dishes this place has to offer.   The other plus is if your in the southeast valley this is definitely closer than Golden Buddha at the Chinese Cultural Center.
0	kSCppR3C6h9AmHztEu5mMg	this is our senond time (last one). the quality of the food is just fair; service not much better. anyone who has been to a good deli and comes here only to be disappointed. you better go soon, if you dare, because this place does not belong in scottsdale and is not low to be around. secondary location with secondary food - sorry, but these are facts.  marty
0	GN7s1IRTApPQmdj9yMmO6w	The sourdough jack is a terrific sandwich if you're craving some meat. I get the value fries with it so I don't get too much and over eat. I can hardly ever finish it but I sure do love that sandwich.
0	swXuXjNKzGJl7XVaiWDhA	Shintaro offers teppanyaki, sushi and contemporary  tasting menus in the dining room. The sushi bar actually faces a kaleidoscopic display of live jellyfish.   I came here for the teppanyaki and it didn't disappoint.   I recommend the "land and sea" pre fixe ($85/person) which includes salad, miso soup, mixed vegetables, prawns, lobster tail, white fish, filet mignon and fried rice. The portions are quite generous so be prepared to eat a lot.
0	acSK16cHjsMjTnr13ILrkQ	Fast food Chinese restaurants are as good as their Sweet and Sour Chicken dish and I can't say I was impressed by China Bowl's.  Granted, the lunch special was a mere $5 (not including the .75 charge for using debit) but the sweet and sour chicken was tasteless.  The chicken was soggy and the disturbingly dark sauce was tasted burnt yet bland. The portions were decent however. Maybe I need to try more dishes or "upgrade" to non-lunch specials, but I'm definitely not ordering S & S chicken again.  Will give China Bowl another try thanks to the review of the reputable Mr. Jared Y..
0	1E4BLs6hQ3Sst7U9ZrRIeA	This review was for delivery service.  Not impressed for the following reasons: -There was a language barrier when placing my order.  Several words and items had to be repeated multiple times for verification. Please have a native English speaker man your phone. -Delivery time was about 20 minutes longer than told.  When called to check on my order, the employee was harsh and abrupt. Have someone friendly man your phones. -Food was very mediocre.  Really lacking. My items were more dough than substance / flavor.  The only reason I gave 2 vs 1 star is because the prices were lower than any other delivery place to my Neville Island hotel.
0	ExYeLS42WiMNeR802s4iw	Wings are good but that's about it. We've been there 3 times and had the same server twice. The server was horrible both times. One of our visits there they were very slow so we thought we'd have her undivided attention but that wasn't the case. Some of her friends showed up and she actually SAT at their table with them and ignored us. We had to ask one of the manager/owners for our check. He was very nice and extremely helpful. If they got rid of this waitress the service could be good. The burger I ordered tasted like it had been frozen. Fresh ingredients and good service are the key to getting repeat business in my opinion.
0	NXzrwGuhOX7xzvvy9S2RLQ	Pork dumplings pan fried. You won't regret it.   We have come to this P.F. Changs a few times and the food is normally great. This specific time we came it was all terrible. We were seated right away which was great but the server seemed kinda out of it. He kept forgetting what we ordered and sat down in the booth while taking our order. The food wasnt very good at all, I was very disapointed in this expereince. I will probably continue to eat at P.F changs but maybe another location.
0	jsm3KFbQnZBqKdtT9FcwjA	I was really disappointed tonight! My baguette was a little soggy and the cafe sua da was definitely not the same. Let's hope these kinks get worked out in due time because I know a lot of us have been waiting for Vegas to get a Lee's for a long time now.
0	GHdO2C0059cEYEqx9h5VDg	Just went there today for lunch before our movie.  I have to say, the service was nice.  We were seated right when we walked in.  The decor is like a "seafood house" in the Pacific Northwest.  Wood planks were used very liberally.  There are TONS of TVs in the joint.  From what I heard, they change the channel of the TV to any game that you want.  OK, now for the food review.  We ordered the shrimp dishes.  I ordered the 35 Shrimp Scampi Pasta, and my partner ordered their 35 Shrimp Plate.  For me, I can tell if their seafood is fresh.  The ones we got were not fresh.  The garlic bread that came with the pasta was cold also(seemed like it was the frozen kind and not cooked all the way through).  I also think the Chef lacks some taste buds because both our dishes were lacking in the seasoning department.  The server said their desserts are great.  Since we had time before the movie, we ordered the Captain Jack's Buried Treasure(ice cream cake doused in fudge).  It was good I have to admit, but with the lackluster lunch, it can't redeem itself from the rating I am giving it today.  I have to say that the prices there are the lowest in Town Square, but you do get what you pay for.  All in all, it was just a mediocre at best.  I would pay more for better food.  Hope this review helps someone.
0	Rfjfh3lmL8BGZwhduwEx0g	The heart of Wildflower is its bakery, and it seems like the restaurant sprung from that. Their menu is wide-reaching, with anything from scones to fritattas, roast beef sandwiches to smoked salmon alfredo.   I have been partial to the pasta, but have heard solid reviews of the breakfasts and sanwiches, as well. It is essentially comfort food at its most basic level, and they don't do much to rock the boat beyond that.   It is at the same time my critique and my endorsement of Wildflower that they stay so true to comfort food recipes. Part of me would like to see something a little more adventurous and innovative, but further consideration makes me concede that my favorite aspect here is that you know what to expect when you order. The food is fresh and fast and the service is good, without much deviation from their traditional ingredients.
0	YaKi3dT6v3DYquJBJsOw	After waiting patiently for this place to open, when they finally did me and my fiancee went out to dinner with a few friends. I did not like the lay out of the place at all, as previous reviewers touched upon, it is one line and things get congested too easily. It makes for an unpleasant visit when you are heading to the buffet.  The food itself was decent quality, by buffet standards, they have the basics, seafood, basic american cuisine like chicken nuggets, pizza, sushi, and other asian cuisine like sweet N sour items, orange chicken, etc. The sushi was quite bland, the salad bar was pretty terrible, the lettuce was quite limp, and the main courses were nothing that stood out. Usually when I go to a buffet there is one or two items that I'd find above average, but here I cannot really think of anything that went beyond the average column.   If I were to give this business advice, it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down, and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality. Most chinese buffets I've been too have had a salmon dish, there was none to be found here, the only fish dishes I found were a grilled fish (which was not edible, it tasted disgusting and bland) and deep fried Tilapia which was extremely bony. Just one example of the poor variety they have here.  I will give the place another shot, perhaps it was just a bad day.
0	apwmoGqnrAPDft1Nb8YJw	This a review based on the a la carte menu.  We called in advance to ask if there are vegetarian dishes, as one of our friends is vegetarian. They said yes. We asked if it was possible if 3 out of 4 people can do the tasting menu since one friend is vegetarian. They said it depends on the Maitre d. We decided to go for it since all the reviews were so great.  When we got there, we were greeted by an awesome staff.  However, they did not have anything vegetarian on their menu except some salads and the cheese plate (no vegetarian entrees). However, they wanted to accommodate us so they said they could create something on the spot. YAY! They said they could make risotto, which my friend was extremely happy about. Then, our server came back and said no risotto, just pasta primavera. Friend was disappointed.  We asked about the tasting menu but they told us no can do. The chef does not like it when the whole table does not participate because one person will just nurse one dish the whole night. I guess it's understandable. We all ordered our dishes a la carte.  I had the french onion soup (light and good) the spinach salad (good, though I could have had it without the raw onions) the duck for entree (it looked like duck burrito and sliced duck..pics posted) and for dessert, the grand marnier souffle (it was okay..but by that time i was too full to enjoy it).  I also had some good red wine to accompany my meal.  I thought the meal was pretty good. However, I still wish I could have experienced the full "glory" of Andre's.
0	kwZlJmmDjAv6FnQJLp48Q	I was in the mood for a damn good burrito and knowing I dont like the place across the street I drove five miles to this cookie cutter replica of a fast food chain desperately trying to be an independent Mexican Restaurant.    The food is average at best very plain and bland. The food on the topping bar was old looking and past its expiration time.   The employees were pleasant and the only redeeming thing about this store.
0	5sN9zNqtnlLFaaBQhBEsHw	Coming from enjoying teriyaki places that sprinkle the Pacific Northwest I was excited to see this place! While my expectations were low it fits the bill for strip mega meals. I got a lot of food. A lot of so so food. It wasn't like it was bad. But it wasn't broiled or chared enough for my liking. The sauce was decent but a little on the salty side.  I ordered the two piece crab Rangoon for funsies but was charged for two orders of crab Rangoon. Being shy I didn't say anything when I didn't understand the price I was told so I handed the man my credit card. Then I saw the receipt for 15! I though dear god I am going to be stuck with so many left overs. Then another man came over and asked if I wanted two orders of the Rangoon and I said well I wanted the two piece order. He said do you want me to take this back? I was like no I paid for both so I want both now lol
0	kKWNFvP4zH2kkMnkpTfINQ	As good as this place is, it seems like once in a blue moon that i have talk to someone who has actually heard about River Moon Cafe.  What is also curious is the place is always packed, maybe its the same people always going just wearing different clothes or maybe my mind was waning.  The first time i went the Tex Mex rolls were recommended.  I have never tried such a concept so i gave it a whirl.  It wasn't the greatest appetizer ever but it was something different and worth the gamble as i left other desiring appetizers in my hand.   For entree, the fillet and the crab cakes were both winners.   On the dark side i wasn't crazy about the wasabi mashed potatoes.   Now I am a big fan of wasabi and mashed potatoes and was eager to try them, but was overwhelmed by the root.   Not sure why chefs try to mess with mashed potatoes so much, just like hamburger helper they do just fine by themselves.   Here are more reasons to grab an arm and head out for a moondance, BYOB, everything is made fresh to order, chef comes out often to check on customers, and they have prefix menu specials during the week.
0	6sVjIAejiAjrpX0sQovLiQ	Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said "that's the way it is", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more "traditional" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.  Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.    Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.  Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.  Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.  On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.

0	pNbZYr6HBGbkCjGun1FxQg	Why do Pittsburgh folks like this place so much? Average portions on spongey white bread with damp fries - in your sandwich. The wait staff was preoccupied (the place was half full), and quite apathetic I may add. Not competitive in my eyes.   I mean, there's a lot of TVs, and the draft beer is ice cold. And cheap. But the food is mediocre at best. The only thing this place seems good for is watching sports and drinking.
0	bI2jVdXLkxyy5xz5yts5Yg	Yeah, I decided to come back and I won't make that mistake again. That is how rude the service is. Actually rude enough to keep me from a good egg sandwich, which is a lot...  It's bad enough that you have to "order at the counter" (which is a pretty vague instruction after all...) and that, of course, no one will actually bother to look up and take your order so you have to kind of awkwardly stand there clearing your throat and hoping that someone notices you look hungry. But then, when you get it wrong, and accidentally order at the cash instead (not wanting to bother the folks who are way too busy cooking), they rudely inform you that you messed up, and that if you're hungry, because you've been sitting around waiting for a sandwich that will never arrive, you kind of deserve it.  No more - this place is ridiculous.
0	93IjocWmfczhcFXNd0NYA	We have ordered pizza and wings several times from this E Wash location, hoping for a different outcome, but unfortunately each time something was wrong or missing and we waited over an hour for the delivery. It makes me so sad because Toppers is our favorite. Warning!!! Either order from a different location or pick it up yourself!!
0	bG2PvektTk6lmMmnLqF4w	Tonight was date night. The BF wanted to try Tia Rosa since we have been awaiting the arrival for sometime now. It is within walking distance so of course we had HIGH hopes for this place. And we were pretty disappointed.  Pros 1. Loved the decor. They went ALL out on this. Really does make you feel like you are in mexico.  2. The Bean Dip App was delish. We really LOVED every bite of it.  3. We went around 5 and was seated very promptly.  4. Margarita were pretty good but nothing to really rave about. Id prefer a mexican place with good margarita specials.  5. THey were quick and prompt with refilling my water.  6. The service was very prompt as far as getting our drinks and food to the table.   Cons 1. Service. Our waitress was not the friendliest. I asked if she recommended a margarita and she really didn't have a good answer. Kinda pointed at a few things but there was no,  "O Yes, You should def try..." I think being a new place in a new location the staff should be very informative and up beat.. When we ordered the enchiladas, we were told we could not have one beef and one chick. We had to pick one meat and one sauce. Not mix and match. Kinda odd, I said to her Ive never been to a place that doesnt allow that. Is there a reason? (bc maybe there is), she said I don't know. Ok then. I think with the economical status we are in, there must be more energetic upbeat people dying for a job.  2. Price. We had an app, 2 Margaritas, 2 entrees and split a friend ice cream. And our bill was $60. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.  3. Chips. Each time we got chips there were about 15-20 per basket, the were constantly needing to refill them. Even with our BIG bowl of app bean dip, it came with about 20 chips and the bowl of dip was HUGE, the chip porportion was way off! 4. Extra sour cream, $1.00. WOW!  And in the middle 1. Fried Ice Cream, it was friend ice cream with strawberries. I really prefer the honey over the strawberry anyday. Wasnt my fave. And I LOVE fried ice cream.  2. Chips and Salsa were ok. Nothing to rave, I would say average.    I think with the place being new and in a great location, the management would be more hands on. I love more than anything when a manager walks the floor to check on the customers. I think that is AWESOME. But this didn't happen while I was there. In the end, I wanted to ask for the manager and tell them to go across the way and step inside Oreganos. BC those people that work over there are the friendliest and Happiest people Ive ever seen in the food service.   I would say to give Tia Rosa a chance and see what you think But in my opinion, I've had much better as far as mexican goes.   I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices. I would def love to see if they have a happy hour bc Id love to go for the bean dip and Margaritas :)
0	ykhiFcaQnIV0ofJETwfrYQ	I'll give the 'economic kitchen' a round up on a 3.5 star review.   I happened by this place the other day and ordered a carne asada burrito.  Usually I gripe about no free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants but I ponied up the extra dollar for some chips to enjoy at their free condiment bar.  A basket of warm tortilla chips came out a few moments later and I was lovin' life.  The salsa roja was really solid I only wish I wasn't so rushed as I would have liked to have tried the salsa verde.  The burrito was big and beefy (insert joke here) and quite tasty.  I'll definitely return to try some of their other dishes when I have the time to sit a spell!
0	xUVuDDpJiuvDJKrgSonmg	I had a great time. I took a magazine and newspaper and just hung out for a while. The food and coffee was great! I had this great Asian Wrap. I even took a sandwich to go for my partner! (which he loved). I'm on my way back there right now to try out breakfast. This is a great little neighborhood cafe
0	uZ2cTgt5mUjXp4wXr5Oecg	Had lunch here today. Ordered the taco and tostada combo with rice and beans... The service was quick, the food was great, and the atmosphere was dark and soothing. The building is a little older and slightly run down, but it has character.  One little ding - We got here a little before 11am (when they supposedly open) and they didn't open the front door until 11:05am (per my cell phone). Grrrrrrr - don't get between a hungry man and his tacos!
0	AagAVCIsIeko83QrcFJmg	Maybe it is because I came in the middle of the afternoon. Maybe it is because the ambience lacked the typical festive energy of a Mexican restaurant but I didn't really enjoy this place. I walked in without anyone in line, and received no greeting whatsoever... A little bit of a downer. In fact, and despite my inability to make a choice at first, the cashier and those behind the counter never bothered to make a suggestion of a dish for me to try.    I decided to play it safe and ordered a steak burrito. Evidently their version of said typical dish only includes beans and a choice of meat. I was really disappointed to learn they do not have any rice or much of anything else to add to their dishes. The steak was somewhat crunchy (a bit old), the beans lacked taste and the meal was, overall, not remarkable at all.   I must sadly say this is is not the place to visit for good food.
0	vLdO1iHeOXq2YFBghUFHA	Wound up here for a farewell lunch for a coworker. Farewell indeed - I will NOT be returning. Granted, as a group of 15, we had a fixed menu. However, that cannot excuse the poor quality of the food at the astronomical prices they charge. For $12 there was barely a handful of salad that was soaked in dressing beside a slice of quiche that was almost all spinach to the point that the crust was soaked. Colour me not impressed. Thank heaven I didn't go for the coffee that was the only thing that came with the meal - it was brown water that you could still see through even with milk. The creme caramel that I choose was meh - flavourless and almost too gelatinous. Good point - the service. The wait staff is quite good though the first waiter did not offer pepper for the soup (which I was told was ok) as did the waitress who followed. The prices are not justified by any means if this is the quality and quantity of the food. Very disappointing.
0	MLHjLsFeT0h5TZbdi2Fltw	Gluten Free Review...  We very rarely order pizza. I am a very sensitive celiac and thought I would give the new Udi's Certified Gluten Free Pizza a try. We ordered online and the website was easy to use. Our order was delivered right when they said it would be and the delivery driver was very nice. The pizza itself was tasty. I did have the pizza cooked well done so the crust was crispy and the toppings were delicious. I did not get sick from the pizza and that is a huge plus in my book. I this is a great option for us when life gets busy. Sometimes you just need to order a pizza! I only gave them 4 stars because the cost is steep... but worth it for a safe gf delivery option!
0	NFeoWxefIvZuV4ZljVcr9g	Shortly after midnight the German, Starsky and myself checked out the cafe. This was my first visit. The other two had been here previously. The menu is huge! Burgers, Apps, pizzas, and other stuff but the key here is breakfast. I want my breakfast after playing some pokers for a few hours.   We started off with some sweet potato waffle fries. Pretty good. Crispy and plentiful for the 3 of us. But what we came for was what we all ordered. Steak and Eggs for $3.99. Boom! Awesome deal. 2 eggs anyways you want, a petite strip steak that was tender. Not a hockey puck like Bill's Gamblin Hall's Victorian Room's steak and eggs for a $1 more. Oh yeah, it also comes with toast, which I got sourdough, and hash browns. Excellent deal and it hit the spot.   The German and Starsky got dessert. Looked yummy. Starsky got a huge sundae and the German got some chocolate molten cake. Service started off a little slow but once they took our drink orders everything went well. When we got the bill the total was $26! Easy game. I'll be back here real soon.
0	WDNn3SUTMrfvd1TQEKVi5g	Open til 2am and they totally don't hold back with the goods. They were nice even tho it was past 1am which is awesome on their part since most people up this late aren't always in the best of moods. But I'm pretty happy with what was served. It doesn't take much to keep this girl satisfied! Lol
0	krIBRGyKXM7gsLVaYjMg	I've always had a good experience at this Red Robin. I usually go with friends or a date and get fries when we place our drink order. The food is always hot and correctly prepared. The tables can be a little dirty and the service a bit slower than I'd like but overall it's a great place to get a veggie mushroom swiss burger.
0	uERSeqytpPWNatytj4Jw	I ate lunch at the terminal 2 location. I ordered the bacon cheddar burger and it came with a 2-inch piece of bacon and invisible cheese that the waitress swore was there. You definitely don't get what you pay for here.
0	GC0SZ9LPTZ8LAw7j8IterA	Typically I would have written a great review for this place. On Saturday night however I was extremely disappointed. I've been to Mabel's almost every weekend for the past few months and it was not until this weekend that I was let down.  A group of friends and I were excited to enter as we love the ambiance, decor, drinks, and general crowd at Mabel's. It all went bad when we came up to the doorman and all proceeded to take out our ID's. He completely ignored us and I watched as a crowd of about 20 Affliction-wearing 50 year old's walked out and left with what looked like hookers. I had to tap on the doorman's back to get his attention and he turned to me and said "Can I help you with something?" We were all taken aback by his brashness but said that we were just interested in coming in. He then told us that Mabel's just started a policy on Fri and Sat nights of members and VIP's only. We were turned away and all left with a very bad taste in our mouths.  With so many different bars, clubs and lounges in the area you would think that this establishment would be smarter than that. We would have spent a good amount of $ there but instead were told we couldn't even get in because we were not 'members.' Total bull. I loved the place up until this encounter and won't be going back any time soon.
0	U9jXf3rykBJViCBvehZQ	So, like others have mentioned, I too was super excited about the addition of a Vietnamese joint here in Phoenix. Similarily, like others, I was let down a little bit by Rice Paper. I love love the look of the place and am hoping they can adjust a few things about the food. I have worked at Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen in Mesa and KNOW good Vietnamese food when I see it. I'd have to suggest that  1- The wait staff know the cuisine a little better as we ordered a pho tai by its name and she didnt know what it was 2- the spring rolls have more flavor and meat, less rice noodle, rolled more tightly, and maye some marinated carrots and daikon in them all . It was super filled with rice noodle, too much  3- the pho be more fragrant and less salty 4- PRICES need to be lowered for the soup at least.   parking was also an issue but it can be like that in the city so nothin can really be done bout that, just be forwarned.  That being said, I do think that it has potential. I will try again perhaps in a few months to check out any changes that have been made.  I love the freshness of Vietnamese eating, and hope to be in love with rice paper eventually since it is so close to home!
0	ZVPCudLkhE6wZSwFFmi5Q	This used to be Mai Island Grill when I was a student at ASU. I noticed Mai Island closed and is now Grill Ave, but since they have a similar menu -- I decided to give it a try.  I was hoping their food would be similar, but it wasn't  :(  I had the chicken teriyaki bento. I'll say the best part was the side salad, but everything else lacked the quality and sweet Hawaiian flavor Mai Island once had.
0	gCCQJ60T4iGfH6tKhBhDQ	I had a fun evening here.  We arrived at around 10:30 pm and headed straight to the restaurant.  The hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait.  I gave her my best "but I'm starving pleeeeaaaase" look, and she said "let me see what I can do."  She hooked us up right away with an amazing table overlooking the Sirens of TI show.  It was a warm, beautiful desert night, perfect for outside, on the strip dining.  I had the links with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The food was way better than I expected!  My date had the pulled pork sandwich (same sides as me) and loved it.  The portions were generous.  We ate and watched the Sirens of TI (which was kinda lame) from the best seats in the house.  Then we went into the club, which was too crowded.  We had a couple of affordable drinks, got our groove on for a song or two, then left.  It was a fun evening of honkey tonk - Vegas style - and bbq.
0	8We9evIp5LjS4uzwjBtA	green chiles on a burger SOUNDS good, but not when the burger isn't very good.   i asked the guy what he recommended and he told me 'fries'. um, ok. but he ended up being right. after i wasn't a fan of my burger i ate a few of the fries and some of my $.99 rootbeer float.   both of those are good. i probably won't be back just because i don't really want either of those on a regular basis, especially when the main dish isn't very good.   those should be delicious compliments to a delicious burger, but not the only thing likable.   in thought, a burger is relatively easy to make it delicious. it's pretty cut and dry but for some reason so few places can make a decent burger.
0	IMyrbz5nWOX5RmeYPFhU8g	Sorry to hear about the negative experiences at Big Mama's in LV. I live in Pasadena, CA and we have the 2nd location of Big Mama's here. While I don't give the decor high marks the food is quite good, especially the fried chicken (4 - 5 stars). The ribs are pretty delicious as well but I usually go to my local Honey Baked Ham store for those instead.   If ever in Pasadena I suggest you give the Pasadena Big Mama's a try - 1453 North Lake Avenue.
0	8S9VKekC8JOVpDvGaYyfA	I used to be a big fan of Pepe's Tacos over on E. Charleston. We would head over there after a night of clubbing and get some tacos to soak up the alcohol. I have tried most of their tacos and the carne asada fries and they were delish. I remmber the meat being really nice and juicy, not fatty at all. So I was excited to see that they were going to be opening another place by my house, I was looking forward to some delicious tacos!   Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the tacos we ordered. We tried tacos de lengua, buche, carnitas and asada and we didn't really like them. They were not at all like I remembered them to be. The quality of the meat could've been better.  Maybe I'll return for the carne asada fries.
0	vdqNZKVtdm5UIdF2qX9e5g	I had low standards for the Arizona Charlie's Buffet and they were still unable to meet them.  Ethnic Food variety: 3 Stars. They do have sushi (looking scary), asian dishes, mexican dishes and typical American type food. Food Quality: 1 Star. If there was a negative star option, I would chose that. The food looks like it is 5+ hours old and previously chewed. The fish was like salmon-jerky.  Service: 4 Stars. I never went without a refill.  Price: 25+Tip for Sunday Dinner for two people... Not exactly a bargain.  The Good: I was able to stick to my healthy diet because everything looked so old and dried out I decided just to have a salad, refried beans and a chocolate cupcake.
0	apEQ55AE8n1u4avLo91Sw	Great breakfast menu for the budget minded.  Don't let the breakfast discount fool you...food is great.  Good service too so I always tip well.  Beats the IHOP (just down the road) prices will better food quality. There is a good but CROWDED breakfast type restaurant South of Kopper Keg near Starbucks that I have not been back to for many years due to the Keg's overall great value  Check them out!
0	Sv79q5GE3b5wICOP8C3g	The only reason I know about this place is because a groupon was offered a few months back. I used to live in this area of Tempe but never noticed this place before, even though its in a pretty big building. I was expecting it to be in like a strip mall and a smaller space. I looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty good. And there was more than one, so I figured why not try it out. I would have been better off skipping this one.  So my husband and I went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there, which always makes me uncomfortable. My husband asked the guy if its always this dead and he didn't really give us an answer which makes me believe that the staff doesn't have much to do all day. Three more parties came in while we were still there. The service was fast, I'll give them that. I have been to some places before where its been pretty dead, and the service is slower than it should be. So the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order. My husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty. So I tasted them, and they tasted like they were dipped in salt. There were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato? But I was too afraid to try them to be sure. Then she comes back and takes our order. I got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast. I thought all sandwiches came with a side, but mine didn't. Which is fine, I wasn't that hungry anyway. My husband got a mozzarella, tomato, and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries. My hash was not what I thought it would be. When you think of a hash, you think crispy potatoes, full of veggies, and just really tasty. Mine was none of those things. It was mushy potatoes, and little tiny bits of vegetables. The rye was decent. Nothing special. My husbands sandwich was better than mine. I wish I had gotten something else. The waitress even asked how it was, and I told her it wasn't anything special.  Most of the sandwiches are really overpriced. Most of the non vegetarian sandwiches were around $11, which seems really steep for this kind of place. Maybe they have to make up for the fact that they have no business? I don't know. This place would probably do better in an only take out environment in a smaller space and lowered the price of their sandwiches to a more reasonable price.   I doubt I will be back unless someone else pays for the meal. The food was not good enough that I was like "I need to come back here tomorrow!" and it was really expensive for what it was, even though the portions were pretty big.
0	dhS6KJeuqnfzR4rFz8HJA	I wish i could give zpizza a five star because the pizza is awesome...i go there usually twice a week because i work right around the corner...i just hate the service, there always so rude and if you get a pizza delivered it takes like 2 hours to get to the office...usually cold but it even cold the pizzas good...i hate the service but what can you do if you want good pizza
0	wENUZR21s1RFpb5IJEzjeg	Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle. This location, however, has gone way downhill. The customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I have noticed employees on the food line ignore customers, forget tortillas in the warmer and burn them, turn their backs on customers they are helping, wipe their noses on their sleeves while preparing burritos, jabber back and forth instead of communicating with the customer in front of them, and even hold hands (apparently a boyfriend/girlfriend pair work there). The food used to be good but is now sadly inconsistent.  I hope that they can pull their act together, because this used to be one of the best Chipotles in the East Valley. Not anymore.
0	QJm9fmjzx1ek0eKLcjnPpw	Well, my boyfriend was talking to the owner of the Indian Grocery on Greentree Rd and he explained that there was a new Indian restaurant opening up on Banksville with the chef from Tamarind behind the wheel. Needless we had to try it.   I must say that it didn't excite me. The food was just adequate. I ordered something that I normally don't order (I'm a Mali Kofta girl) and it is a pretty popular item I'm sure. I've had better at the Days Inn down the road. That's pretty sad. The boy had soup and something else and just wasn't a fan.   I think we'll be going back to Tamarind.
0	T3YRybxQzDtkvTFQqmP4zQ	Stopped by the other evening with Chrissy P. and Andrew K. after hiking North Mountain, at this point we were ready for a refreshing beverage and something to eat. We chose to sit on the patio since it was such a pleasant evening.   Turned out that on Monday's Corbin's special is happy hour menu and pricing is available all night! *Bonus*   I sampled the Sesame Crusted Seared Tuna - tasty and delicious with a great combination of flavors and textures. I am looking forward to return visits to sample other menu items.
0	8SVSt4zHvnshQxILzou1vg	I swear I wrote a review about this place. At any rate a nice place to go for a quick bite to eat. The have customized my lettuce wraps each time because I don't want all the sodium that is added (makes them very salty). I have been more times than I have checked in.and I will keep coming back.
0	yMncqgUiC4jx1V7DvdIG5w	I'm a Vegas local and recently visited the LVH for a wine tasting and went to dinner at Tatuado after the wine tasting.  Long story short...the street tacos served at the wine tasting were 100x better than the food served at Tatuado. The chips tasted like they were straight from the bag.  The salsa tasted like it was straight from the bottle.  The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?  Everything I ate here I could've bought on my own at my local grocery store. My friends didn't like their food at all (cheese enchilada and chicken sandwich).  My club sandwich was good.  The biggest positive was the strawberry margarita.  It was delicious.   Overall, this place was very mediocre.  I wouldn't return.  There are SO many better options in Vegas.
0	hFUCBS2XKWiVH5zVZYQzhw	They have a great looking shop, was not impressed with the gelato, or the selection of treats. I work in a hotel room service and I noticed most of the treats they were offering were things I have seen when we do catering functions.  If this is your first time going there do not expect anything like a starbucks sized or type drink. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but the only thing I can say about sambalatte is they have a nice shop.
0	LD7JZ30uNPcEyLssAkEzeA	If you don't spend extra money for food, get swiped into the DC forsure! If you're looking for amazing food, this is the wrong place to go. Whenever I'm not really caring about what I eat, I'll be here and hope they are serving decent food. Whenever they don't have anything I like, I usually just either make myself a salad from the salad bar or I just eat cereal. There are also a few very rude staff members.. -_-
0	W3oZHZuunmoDR1bKYs8Cg	Thin and Saucey. Fresh and cold. No I'm not talking about Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton. It's the pizzas and salads at Sauce. I normally don't like the order here, sit down there kinda restaurants. But this place does it right. I'm not going to get into NY vs. Chicago vs. California vs. Tombstone. Save that for a thread, right? I love pizza. So I love them all. Depends on my mood. These pies are delightful. My fave is the sausage and caramelized onion. The potato pizza is hella good. Spinach salad with pine nuts and goat cheese...perfect with my sausage pizza. Service is cheap and the prices are friendly. There's plenty of atmosphere and the parking is light and airy. So get Sauced. Today!
0	24cQxEcNidGadPH4QFHA	Came here for lunch the other day and was shocked at how bad the service was. I stood there for about 10 minutes waiting to order for dine in and both guys behind the counter were on the phone taking orders. I get it. They were busy. But when one of them got off, he proceeded to go and make orders! He didnt even acknowledge me! As a matter of fact, neither of them acknowledged me. So I wait for another 5 minutes and still the same scenario. I left wondering what the heck were these guys doing? I know both of them saw me but did nothing. Def will be awhile before I even consider coming back if at all. That's too bad because I thought their food was really good.  Yelp 365 Review Challenge #142 "Saddy's Pizza"
0	Yo6OnragAjEfDlu1OvqQw	Pretty ordinary and disappointing. We are fans of Petite Maison and expected a similar level of care in the BBQ. Instead we had overcooked ribs and way too solid brisket. The waitstaff was good though
0	uYynsisvhpWKQWOO7Qtzw	Location: it's in centropolis laval at the dowtown core of laval shall I mention with a Mont tremblant feel to it ! It's actually inside this small mall called marcher gourmand/ fruiterie 440 next to the huge movie theatre colossus laval.   Huge problem: they close the entire mall at 6pm on the weekdays which is kind of stupid while the rest of the shops close at 9 or 10!  Back to the place: the place inside is very authentic and has that quality factor. It has a rustic and authentic feel of homemade bread as you walk in to the bakery! It's suppose to have that sense too bad they lack that in their service!  Foodwise: I ended up ordering their smoked salmon sandwhich (lax) and creme cheese with their thin specialty bread (au grains ancien) i also had their goat cheese sandwich with mix piment rouge et vert (red & green peppers) it was not that great! The goat cheese was off.. And had An odd aftertaste!   They specialize in their bread not their sandwiches lol  Service: Not so friendly :/ the ladies gave me dirty looks as I walked in. Sometimes I wonder what have I done to them to deserve these kind of looks.. They were chatting in the back and laughing probably not very professional :/ As I ordered, the girl had a very annoyed face and couldn't wait to get rid of me. I guess the service really turned me off and I will not be coming back that's for sure!
0	Knsvx9AURR2TDduqVbhswA	The only time to go to this upity bar/restaurant  is on Monday, early evening. Because the Appetizer's are half off and they have a dellicous, huge variety to make great meals out of. From a Raw tuna poke stack to a big, thin slice of pizza. The appetizer list is better than the Menu. But,  if you are into beer tasting or just searching for that one beer you can't find anywhere, then please go anytime. You will surely be satisfied.
0	ZnFBhbAO5P7SrXhFc9QcQ	SWANKY!  You know you're going to a great place when you walk inside and it is 3 people deep at the bar and everyone is enjoying themselves. The bartenders are quick to take care of you and make sure you have an incredible experience. It's nice to have so many varieties of martinis.   Then once you are entering the main dining room, the real experience begins. Again, this staff is quick and friendly to ensure you have a memorable time. I would highly recommend the fillet Mignon, medium rare, with a side of creamed horse radish sauce. Their cream corn has been a signature dish since opening day and it tastes better spoon by spoon by spoon.   While I am not a connoisseur of desserts, I have seen what they have to offer and it is far from being disappointing.   Granted this steakhouse might seem a little pricey in comparison to others in the city, however it is the attentive service combined with the variety, presentation and excellence of food that makes this a place one not to miss.
0	NCXkPvcJ4H55ic5VrnVUcA	I went a couple months ago.  All I remember is the steak tartare, which was very grey.  I asked the waiter since I'm more used to tartare being bright red.  He said that they let it cure in lime juice because they're doing something "different than everyone else".  That's fine.  I personally did not think it looked appetizing or tasted good.  I don't remember the rest of the food, but it wasn't great or terrible.
0	In3CKhzBtT4PCFcFME4uA	This is my pizza delivery place when I need something QUICK and reliable.  I love all their flavored crusts and the baked subs are delicious.  This isn't spectacular pizza that is going to change your life, but it is tasty and they deliver FAST and we have never had an order be incorrect.  Try the garlic crust, yum.
0	xp9jQqRwPyyMptUKTxLtWQ	This place has gone downhill, quickly. Avoid. Search other places in walking distance instead.  Problems: The clientele. The decor. The lights are left on at night. The drinks aren't made well. Shotty service.  Pros: They have TV's.
0	vTLeIgfsKFUK4wnPmcALIA	Stoked to find Ethiopian in my new home city.  I love the spice combos in Ethiopian dishes... it's just enough to add a satisfying flavor but not overwhelming by any means.  And the food here met that expectation. Service... eh, a little pokey, considering we were one of two tables being served at the time.  And all of the domestic beers listed on their menu were not available when we went, who knows why.  But the food was pleasing enough to still merit fandom.  Just come maybe 20 minutes before you're *actually* hungry, you know, when you're like well I could eat right now, but it'd be more out of boredom than hunger.  Yeah, go when that feeling hits you.
0	TfzLQOHg2ks4JbDAUQWN7w	We just moved and thus Rosati's is close to our new home. Yummy Chicago style thin crust!  We like to go pick up our pizza. The facility was clean nd the people super nice. Have been there 2 times already.   We'll be back.
0	ODTDMdoSodDSRiv7D6KrJg	Can someone PLEASE get these people a new phone! My boyfriend called in our order both times we've had pizza here and it seems to be this big ordeal just to get the girl on the other line to hear our order correctly. Each time they've added a whole extra pizza to our order that we never asked for. On top of that, we were told our pizza would be ready 30min, so we LEFT OUR HOUSE about 30 to 40minutes after placing our order. At that point we expected to have our pizza ready, if not coming soon after arrival. Low and behold, we were left waiting for another 20 for a lukewarm pizza that was less than exciting. Now, it wasn't terrible...but it wasn't the best either. Heck I'm sure it would have been a great pizza if it didn't taste like it sat under a heating lamp for the day. More than anything, if it weren't for their bumbling mistakes, I'm sure we'd be back more often.
0	AutVw0smVKcx6sW9Kbgg	What a DISAPPOINTMENT !!  About a month ago we had a stellar lunch here. Great food, even better service. Decided to bring friends back with us to give them a treat. My bad.  Our server was perfunctory at best, with an attitude. Dishes came out of the kitchen with no thought - starters were served with mains, items were missing from several plates. Some were inedible (meatballs and lava chicken). It took ages for the food to come out of the kitchen (at a not very busy lunch hour). This happened on our first visit too, but since everything was tasty, and our waiter entertaining we didn't mind. But who wants to wait for bad food and unpleasant service?
0	kwJsQCvO3znUF3DtLpy5A	I like Pizza Hut pizza, but this place is slow and often gets my order wrong. I've only ever done delivery and have never received my order in under an hour. I've been digging the balsamic drizzle, and 50% of the time that I request it, I don't get it. Same goes for soda. The drivers are always nice, though.
0	iMZLwUuc2X2VuuSo1dfUNA	Used to be known as Tri-State Pizza but now FAMILIA PIZZERIA.  They have all of the usual Italian dishes of pastas, hot and cold subs, but seem to focus on their pies.    As some of you may know, I'm from the outskirts of Philly and feel I know when a pizza shop makes good pie.  So, when I go to a mom & pop pizza shop, the way I judge their pies is by tasting either a plain cheese or pepperoni pie.    Familia Pizzeria makes a good (North) East Coast pie.  I had their large  (18") plain pie for $13.96 (including tax).  The ratio of cheese/sauce was perfect.  To describe the sauce, it wasn't chunky (marinara style), nor was it runny (sauce from a can) but, it had the traditional herbs with good taste and texture.  Each slice was foldable and thin.  I would've given this place five stars had there been more grease on top of the pie and if the bottom of the crust was less brown (a bit too crispy) but, this place certainly beats Metro Pizza.  Metro is good but not as authentic.  Perhaps the owners have lived in Vegas too long that they forget what pie should taste/be like?  I called my order in for carryout.  My pie was ready when I got there with NO wait.  I added a two liter bottle of coke ($2.75 + tax).    The ambiance was what you would expect of a small pizza shop.  As you walk in, there's a small display of pies available by the slice.  They did look a bit old but I got there at 4:15pm--way after the lunch rush and a little too early for the dinner crowd.  It had about six tables which were clean and decorated with red/white plaid table cloths.  At the register, there was a white board with daily specials.  Today (Wednesday), one of the specials was Italian Wedding Soup--that's the only thing I can remember.  Of course, there's a Coca-Cola refrigerator with two liter bottles, 12 oz. bottles, and bottles of Yoo Hoo.  Beside it, there's a self serve Coca-Cola soda fountain.  The fountain is a big "PLUS" in my book because sometimes I like to mix sodas to get unique flavors.  For instance, did you ever notice at SUBWAYS they always have self serve fountains...well, try mixing half Minute Maid Lemonade with half Nestea Raspberry Iced Tea...WOW, it'll be the bomb'est Arnold Palmer you'll ever have!!!!!!!!  Okay, back to Famila Pizzeria...it's in a strip mall on the far left.  Depending on what direction you are coming from on Durango, it's kind of hard to see because it sits almost directly behind Bomas Bar & Grill.  And when you do drive there, the roadside sign doesn't say Familia Pizzeria OR Tri-State, it just says PIZZA (or maybe PIZZERIA).  Hours: Monday-Thursday 11am-10pm Friday-Saturday     11am-11pm Sunday                    11am-9pm  Familia Pizzeria does do delivery so you don't have to do DiGiorno tonight.
0	dyFDaeLCiHopzazyTbdYQ	I'm always looking for places that doesn't include burgers and fries.  Everyday on my way to work and coming home from work, I am always driving by this restaurant not even giving it a second thought.  Finally, I just decided to get dinner here with no questions asked by my subconscious.    I ended up ordering the Chicken with mixed vegetables  in black bean sauce.  I thought this was really good.  The chicken was moist and tender and didn't have an after taste.  My boyfriend even liked it.    The next day because I just didn't want to eat McDonald's again, I decided to get their Pork and String Beans with Black Bean Sauce.  Yes, I'm a fan of Black Bean Sauce.  It's one of my favorite sauces when ordering Chinese.  The taste of the pork was a little strong for my liking.  Unless the different cooks just make a difference in their cooking.  But, for now, I'll stay away from this dish.  It was better tasting with chicken.
0	e8cAKIajORNeKKNMbba9Uw	This is my 2nd time reviewing this place. I gave it a pretty good review before but now I've changed my opinion. On two subsequent return visits, my orders were done incorrectly.  I'm talking 2 out of 3 sandwiches were wrong both times. It's a sandwich, not rocket science, kids.
0	Qhg9URMIy06jds21FdM5OA	So it was my birthday and chinese food freak that I am, figured we should lunch here. We ordered all vegetarian items except for the sesame chicken which was really good. We had a noodle dish with tofu which was very flavorful, and something called deep fried tofu, which was decent. We also had some rolls which were pretty good. I would say that it was really good, plus the place was nearly empty, so the service was great. Washed down with a nice bottle of Perrier and we were good to continue on our way. The best thing was that we didn't have that bloaty feeling some chinese can give you. The food left me feeling light and energized.
0	Huba13sWZ9seb2vOO6D6xA	It sucks that I have to give 2 stars for food from a place that used to be quite good.  But it sucks even more that we paid $31 and change for less than mediocre food.  We ordered to go food last night.  We purchased a french dip, their November wing special and a club sandwich.    First off the french dip was barely edible.  It had shredded beef and was over salted and way too much pepper.  That was my dinner.  My husband ate half and we threw half away.  The wings were breaded and fried and came with fries.  Pretty good deal for the price.  However hubby ordered plain with mild sauce on the side.  The wings, unsauced, were very spicy so just be aware. How is that even possible?  And the club sandwich was okay.  The bread was greasy from the cheese.  It's like they grilled the cheese and then added the cold meats.  The fries that came with the food were good.  The french dip was almost $12.00, the wings $7.00 and the club sandwich I think was around $10.00 or so.
0	eATzaAYnkpvQm22JtUDISA	Your typical, delicious smelling subway. There's not a ton of seating (or at least not compared to the other subways I've been to), but the one time I've dined in instead of getting it to go, it seemed that most people weren't staying in to eat. So it works.
0	VoXgHyuoBE60qbXvGFlmg	very houstons-esque. i hear that an old houston's employee started this place. the decor, menu & feel is very similar. the chicken was great.  they serve cous cous as one of their side options (crazy! very tasty as well). their wine selection was varied & good as well. service was good & attentive. a big plus- for a party of 8 people there was no added gratuity.
0	ZesfYSCDtV85ZuX4vDrrgg	Great interior and fantastic service.  Was there for a Thursday lunch.  Shared the Elizabeth special pizza.  Cheese was watery, virtually no sauce, and a bland taste.  Even loaded up with salt, pepper - bland.  Not what I remember from other Hawthorne locatons.  Didn't have time to re-order.
0	nNHaMn15P7diLHXOGnoYQ	One of the better hole in the wall places in Vegas.  The sticky rice is a great compliment to the curry dishes.  I'm not a big fan of Thai BBQ, but I hear from most people I know that this is the place to go.
0	rPEOzCYIlPCM54eTvlSw	So I really wanted to like this place but ..... The drive showed up with a tazer and preceded to charge it while standing next to my 2 year old nephew. (To show him). Then the antipasti salad was the worst I ever had. Lettuce was bitter and they give u ranch??  The pizza was cold and the wings were over breaded. They delivered fast and the soda was cold bit otherwise it was a bust
0	Vi4pczz9GRyHmPnv8i5A	Service could have been better. Curry nothing to remember. Sushi was blah. Katsu seemed like it was leftovers that was re fried. Was really hoping it would be great spot since I live so close by but I won't be returning.
0	RtAprDgpNPfzp50b1qAF8A	I was here with some awesome college loves and didn't know what to think of the place at first.  I mean, they were raving about how good it was but I didn't see how one pancake was better than another.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch in the District, a little bit of a drive if you're coming from the West but nothing to complain about.  We had to wait, but it wasn't terribly long, and our waitress turned out to be a sweetheart.  I ordered pancakes with strawberries and whip on top.  When I got it, the strawberries looked so perfect I almost didn't want to eat them, almost.  Every one's plates looked incredibly delicious actually, and considering that no food was left uneaten, they must have been.  My mouth was so delighted by my choice it's still thanking me.  The whipped cream was more like vanilla icing which just made it that much better.  A breakfast dessert is basically what it was, if only every morning meal could be such a treat.
0	70xlRRq8QXbqm9wjshyJw	Great pizza at good price.  Staff was courteous.  Helped me with what I wanted.  Think this will be my new "go to" place in Las Vegas.  I ordered a combination garlic and BBQ chicken.  Worth waiting for.
0	UZhXfmeqpqX3NhJ951YA	I had a good meal here. The sausage and fennel pizza had very little red sauce but was very very tasty. The chopped salad was delish and it made me feel good about ordering it. The calamari app though was not what I had expected. I like tentacles and the calamari looked more like mozzarella sticks.
0	YUGLqSsRbPcYZXU6YA8M8Q	You can't beat the atmosphere of Lou's. It's a flashback to a simpler time. Every visit you are greated with a smile and great service. I've never seen the bottom of my coffee cup and always leave feeling like that was going to be the only meal of the day. The chicken fried steak was huge and topped with some of the best gravy around. I'd put their pancakes up against anyone's in a "Battle for best breakfast." Located on the NE corner of Decatur/Alta, it is well worth the trip from anywhere. If you're looking for a good, hearty, stick to your ribs breakfast, you won't be disappointed. The staff is fast and friendly and doesn't mind if you want to substitute or have a special request. I would highly recommend the "Hay Stack" for first time guest. Our crew from work has kind of become regulars here. We are never dissatisfied and we keep coming back.
0	ciZfI71jUSh5vBl5b1qdsQ	Really yummy greek / middle eastern food out in Carefree, Arizona.  I was staying at the Boulders Resort and had a craving for falafel.  This place was 5 mins drive from the hotel, and is located near the Spanish Village shopping area.  The falafel platter was very good!!  Falafels were crisp on the outside, moist on the inside and flavorful - lots of fresh garlic.  It came with a nice tahini sauce, grilled veggies, pita, and basmati rice.  I was super pleased with my meal.  Authentic mediterranean food.  It wasn't cheap per se, about $16 for my dinner platter but you get a lot and everything was high quality.   If you're in the area, go here!
0	0pTRPblgP1xttQzhS2rjdA	Sure the decor is a little cheesy but for the price and quality of the food you get, I will happily look past it. The first time we came here I set my expectations to low to medium, based on it's location and price point. After a lovely first meal, however, we decided to again visit this establishment on our recent trip and I am so glad we did.  Once again I will bring up the price point, but only to illustrate the value of what you get. A large Cajun Ribeye with a side baked potato and a very generous sized salad will set you back only $34.00. This is about a third of what my boyfriend and I normally pay for a good steak dinner. The blue cheese salad is great, and I love the hearts of palm and artichokes that they generously add to the mix. The Ribeye is very large and tender and I love their blackening seasoning. Not quite on par with Morton's steak quality but a close runner up. A loaded baked potato? What's not to love? Oh and to you bread lovers, they hook it up! Pretzel bread buns, brioche style buns, and a great crusty raisin and nut artisan style bread. Yummy!   Great quality and value and great service equals happy Rebecca.
0	SqN9ixz36WOnVemJ7YyzWg	Ugh. I want to love this place like some of my friends, but going to the original one and waiting for hours just to get some special "Hot" food has left me feeling not positive for the visit to this new location.   Went on a Wednesday with the Mrs and a friend that pushed me through the door. Same Padre's feel... I was feeling better. Got seated right away and got chips and salsa and waters pretty quick... alright! and then we sat, and sat, and sat. We were in a little room in the front where the entrance to the patio was and could see all the servers headed in and out with drinks and food. I knew it was too good to be true. Finally got a drink order in and he was def hurried. no small talk, just wanted you to order. I think the the place was maybe 1/3 full.   Got drinks and then waited for about 15 minutes. WTF! Finally ordered with not even a "Eff You!" from the waiter. At least it gave us time to catch up and take in the decor. Food came and looked better than i remembered. But the food was the same... Meh. (see other LDM review) Meh NM style food. My family is from NM. I grew up on the stuff! This is just hot to tasteless, salty plate of rice and beans!   I would come back to have HH at the bar. area At least Padre's left that to still be enjoyed.
0	qjLLmUSAgRerAwK5pRmT8Q	Pretty underwhelming. We summed it up: "Caf\u00e9 Milk has a likeable charm to it, and is good at what it does. However, it didn't really wow us like it could, and perhaps should, have. There's an opportunity being lost here, by an over-commitment to "meek chic". It works for the setting, but the food needs to be much bolder because, as it stands, it's not that memorable."
0	d5CjPoSoFVbUggWrN60HAw	I have waited so many years to finally try In-N-Out and it was like heaven. Everything was so fresh and flavorful and outshines any other fast food places in the country. Be sure to look up other menu options online since they only have the simplest things listed on the board. Animal style fries are amazing!
0	AEHqPiQFmy3rbSjWeUdhw	Burrito was pretty good. Whoever says these burritos are like the ones in the Mission either haven't been to the Mission or are just liars. The burrito had pico and sour cream but those were the only similarities shared with its Nor-Cal cousin. I like all the SF pics, but the burrito was meager just like all the other burritos in this dessert. I was so stoked too! Bummer.  And good price? I paid $7 for a carne asada "super" burrito. Not bad, but with no leftovers not cheap either.
0	jzbzQDPjxveqpLnNwNbw	I stopped by because I was on a rush, I ordered a California burrito, asada meat, pico de gallo, French fries and cheese.  It wasn't bad, I ate it, but definitely not the best Carne asada burrito, probably won't be eating here again soon.
0	dgkH955UnTp9TVflZhbdAA	Service is decent food could be better. $1 per slice of bacon side order is pretty step. Restaurant cleanliness is lacking as well. Looks like stuff that's been on the floor for the last few days. Most likely won't be going back unless I hear things have improved.
0	J7Ase5J2kDaQ6LsbBu3tKw	Really disappointed by this place. I'm a vegetarian who loves Chinese food, so I had high hopes. We got the General Tao Tofu and a vermicelli dish, and both were not good. The sauces weren't tasty and the tofu wasn't the best either. It was about $30-35 for a meal that was pretty meh. It's too bad, because it's a good location and the owners seem really nice, but the food just wasn't worth it.
0	erEHbg7nhaHkqyq2uRvVg	this bar provides some much-needed relief from the frat boy scene around the square. the bartenders and waitstaff are friendly, they have a good selection of beer, it's never packed and they're always playing great music. something about this place feels like home to me, as cheesy as that sounds - it's not too bright, not too loud, there's a johnny mnemonic pinball machine (wtf?) and the decor is great - well worn and divey without being gross.  the food leaves a bit to be desired (not great, not terrible), but i think everything else makes up for it.
0	wu6kUwqGkx1Mdxo0N1Mg	I love this place.  I go again and again, even though it is a good 40 minute drive.  Everything they have is always delicious, and the staff is friendly!  Plus you eat FREE on your birthday, what is not to love!  Pulled pork is one of my faves with macaroni and cheese!
0	R36QBQLOo71p6JygJxGzQA	I stopped in here on a Thursday night around 8pm. I was drawn in by the sandwich board sign that had all sorts of good dishes listed. The restaurant was much bigger on the inside than expected and it was brightly lit, colorful and welcoming.  However, when I opened the door, I only saw 4 people sitting at a circular table towards the middle/ back of restaurant. I wasn't sure if they were customers or people who worked there. They didn't acknowledge my presence so I waved a little and asked, "Are you open?"  Someone answered, "Yes," but they all continued to sit there. Talking amongst themselves. Were they playing cards? Having a staff meeting? I don't know, but it was bad customer service to not get up and show us a table or at least smile and stand up.  My friend an I picked a table and went to sit. Menus appeared but no drinks were offered. The four of them continued to sit at the table. It looked like one of them was folding menus. Maybe the other 3 people were friends visiting the restaurant. Maybe not.  But a customer standing in front of you takes priority over folding menus and chatting amongst yourselves.  The menu choices looked good. It's too bad I didn't have a server to come talk to us and keep our interest. My friend and I took this bad start as an omen to bad service for the whole meal and we got up and left.  Service at a restaurant is nearly as important as the food. Nothing makes food taste worse than bad service. And you can be sure, a customer won't come back if bad service was given and no amends were made to make it better. Worse yet, a customer will give a bad review and tell their friends the service sucked.  As much as I would give this place a one-star, I respect the fact that this is a "mom & pop" kind of place, I'm not trying to drop their business. However, these folks need to know because of my experience, if someone told me the food was awesome here, I'd have to follow up with my personal experience outlined in this review.
0	jXZ6x2uPFjSgdkPyXreTPA	I get the veggie platter to go several times a month. I love it! The service is good and it is ready and waiting for me when I arrive! I love the sambusas also! My fave Ethiopian is at Rahels on Fairfax in LA, but this is a close 2nd!!
0	QUZi3Oc4Jmyp67proHYPWw	Got a Irish coffee over the weekend with a friend. Nice decor and very laid atmosphere. Was not impressed with having to wait at the counter while she said "one moment",,, ummm shouldn't you drop whatever you are doing and help your customers? I wouldn't have ordered anything if I had noticed the "Grade C" inspection rating earlier.
0	4q7gZYIcJViwClt56jP2g	This place has gone way down hill. I ordered the steak hoagie and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken hoagie and both hoagies barely had any meat on them. I told the waitress about it and she brought over the manager who told me there was nothing he could do about it and that the meat is proportioned out beforehand.  They also charged my friend $3 to add lettuce and tomato to the large hoagie ($1.49 +tax a topping).  Unless you want to eat a bread sandwich and overpay for toppings, I would try a more reasonable hoagie place.
0	xaH62SyRy6qtkOJm4X5Q	My wife and I were looking for a place that advertised Prime Rib for $9.99 but wound up in this restaurant just because it looked nice. After walking through the casino and thinking yuck! We stumbled upon this diamond in the rough.   We were able to be seated without reservations. My wife ordered the petite Prime Rib and I thought about what petite would be (small) so I ordered the regular Prime Rib. When they brought her plate, her portions were the size that I thought I was ordering. The petite was a very generous portion. The waiter brought my plate and jokingly laughed and said "You have to eat this in 15 minutes." MY eyes bugged out of my head and I thought about the show "Man VS Food"! That piece of meat was about 2" thick and covered what seemed to be 3/4 of the plate. But It was quite tasty. Needless to say that I didn't finish it and I didn't need to go out for dinner or lunch for the rest of the week! The garlic mashed potatoes were great, but I thought the vegetable portion was lacking based on the size of the meat portion.  My suggestion if you're ordering the Prime Rib. You'll be satisfied with the petite.
0	6zYrHhvtXJQ3L86K2bIzQ	1/2 & 1/2 does not equal 2 at Nicantoni's Pizza.  We were looking for a local pizza place that had a larger menu with such things as Chicken Parm.  I went on Yelp and found Nicantoni's reasonably close.    I saw that Aileen had reviewed it favorably so that carried some credibility.  We went and ate at the restaurant.  They have a funky atmosphere and friendly staff.  Working so far.  We shared a pie and my wife ordered the chicken parm.  It looked good and came with a nice side of spaghetti.  The pizza was tasty with a nice thin crust.  It was slightly soggy in the middle but in fairness we had lots of toppings.    I appreciate that they charge appropriately for toppings.  So if you order 1/2 onion and the other 1/2 mushroom it counts as 1 topping not 2 as many pizza places charge.  They also carry limited beer and wine which is another plus.
0	2ayBge72W2qFCFyiyosMA	WOW. $15 four course meals(current promo)  I ordered 1. Potato bacon soup, 2. Caesar salad, 3. Coconut habanero shrimp, 4. Brownie a la mode.  Service was prompt and efficient, even a little shake of humor, no hiccups whatsoever.  Food, well, besides the cheddar bay biscuits hitting the spot, yes baked to perfect goodness. Send me out to my B.A.(biscuits anonymous) meeting, 'cause I'm officially an addict.   Soup was nice and perfectly HOT, the way I love it.   Salad, ehhh, not so perfect. I had my own learning experience to ask for dressing on the side in the future because it was drenched(I prefer my green leafs to be drenched 15% instead of 115%). with that said, I was full by the time they brought over my main entree.  Main, the idea of coconut and habanero (sweet, then kick in my mouth) is culinary-bipolar science and art goodness. Can we do this over with each shrimp? Thanks. I enjoyed some of the shrimps and sack of rice pilaf. Because I was full by the time salad was done, the rest was boxed up with an unrequested bag of those crack biscuits. Way to go the extra block mr. Server.   Truly, so much food, that I asked my date to ask for box, dessert, and bill within 3 bites of my main.   Dessert, I like brownie a la mode. But as another learning experience, I should ask what else it comes with, because too much caramel and chocolate drizzle on both brownie and ice cream takes away from the balance of sweetness, making it way too sweet to enjoy. Next time, I'd prefer a plain scoop of "mode", thanks.  Overall, this rating goes for the meal and service, and id like to come back and try their signature and fresh fish offerings.
0	W9Xkh9k7FTjWYUn9YI1Lbg	Better than any of the robertos in town for sure.  The machaca burrito is a must try, the meat is always tender also.  All the menu items are tasty and never dissapoint.  Best option for taco shop food in the southwest.  I did eat the amigo grande burrito also, the cool thing about it is the fact you can put whatever you want in it.  Makes the perfect late night chow, and then will have some left overs to heat up for breakfast to cure your hangover
0	DxxvKCIOJxUgLaQ9MQfxCw	Great place to eat, although the place is kinda pricey!  We ate here close to closing, but the staff gladly seated us.  We got great service for being so late and the food was de-lish!  The dessert was awesome too!  The surroundings are an eyecatcher (and an ear opener!). There are huge fish tanks, along with animated jungle animals in the "rainforest."  The bar area has an awesome waterfall effect.  Good food, casual dining, I will definitely be back here.
0	JDcAdSuZhd4RL1wU7gcdeQ	Even though the Rio is about a mile off the strip (on the opposite side of the I-15), people flock here for their famous Carnival World Buffet for a reason.  Dining here gives you a taste what a real Las Vegas buffet is all about.  Several different stations spread across the front of the buffet, allowing you just about anything you can find in Las Vegas here in one place.  The price for lunch isn't bad--about $18.00--but for the clever consumer, get into the buffet shortly before lunch begins, gaining you access to breakfast foods, along with the lunch as it becomes available.  This place is truly worth a try.
0	12LuyIAJ5b4zzYwxqPxRzQ	Maybe it was an off day, but I thought the food today was not very good at all. The BF and I each got a 'k sadilla,' I got the steak and he got the chicken. Maybe this item isn't the best thing to get here... I don't know. It was soggy and had waaaay too much cheese. The steak was chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as 'cajun.' The k sadilla had cabbage in it.... but the cabbage wasn't cut at all... there were huge pieces of it in this thing. Overall, the flavor was off putting (and I like Cajun food), it was greasy, and the whole thing fell apart while trying to eat it. I would not get this again, not when there are 3 other very good choices in the same parking lot (the bbq, the hot dogs, and the grilled cheese).
0	gMdGhHVCPQzzlwbntBPaw	Due to accessibility I've been back twice to Steel Cactus and my consensus is just meh for meals but great for drinks and chips. The first time we sat at the bar. Ordered chips and queso and a beer, which was thumbs up. I like how their chips are seasoned. I ordered the chicken tacos but the food lacked flavor. The chimichanga dessert though was the bomb! The second time we ordered chips and guacamole traditional, which was (standard) delicious. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the salmon and pineapple ceviche and I was not a fan at all. The ceviche was a big bowl of mush by the time I received and the flavors did not meld well together. Also we tried to order Dos Equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer. And while the waitress didn't charge us for that draft beer she handed us a bottle of Dos Equis and charged us for that, as oppose to asking if we wanted another type of beer. What a bummer as had high hopes for Steel Cactus.

Upon entering I noticed that all of the 7 tables were filled which I thought was fine because I don't live too far away so take out is no big deal. It took me 15 minutes just to place my order and after I ordered I realized that nearly everyone else who was in the restaurant was waiting on food too. All in all I ended up waiting nearly an hour for my plate. About time I did get my plate they were out of greens and yams so I opted for macaroni and cheese, beans and rice and cabbage as my sides. The mac was a little bland for my taste and the cabbage was just okay, my fried chicken was a little bland too. My sister had the catfish which was really good in size and cut but again it lacked flavor. The owner was genuinely nice an apologetic and the only reason I waited that long was to support her new business. They just opened in August 2012 so I'll go back in a couple of weeks and hopefully they have all the kinks worked out.

Friendly guy but obviously didn't take notice to our complaint. We gave him 20% anyway.  Very expensive lunch. 3 burgers with some fixin's, a spiked milkshake, sweet potato fries and a diet coke came to $81.00 with tax and tip. $3.50 for the diet pepsi? Wow!
0	R4WgDRGNu2ToAcZxwD2A	I'm trying to find a good sushi place that isn't too pricey that I can order delivery from - after Osaka, I will keep looking.  I ordered a crunchy scallop roll, spicy salmon roll and a New York roll (tuna and avocado) for delivery - $1 delivery charge and pretty quick (30 min) delivery was great.  $25 for 3 rolls - pretty good.  But the actual sushi??  Not so much.  I don't know what was missing but all the rolls were very bland.  I couldn't even really distinguish by taste which was tuna, which was salmon, etc.  They all tasted the same - of nothing.  The crunch was dried panko on top of the roll - not too tasty.  I would say try some other places first if you want that mouth-watering sushi taste that makes you crave it - because it isn't here.
0	lPg6tGGvuW2tEjzBi6Qg	Ok, this is one of my favorite places in my neighborhood.  I live nearby, so it is very convenient.  Not only that, but the food is great too.  Some of my favorite dishes are below........  Breakfast - Frittatas.....they have several to choose from, they are all great. Lunch/Dinner - the New York Stromboli, Cajun Chicken Wrap, Pizza, and Pasta w/Proscuitto.  With the number of big screen TVs in this place it is a great place to come and catch a Football game or playoff Basketball/World Series game while getting something to eat.  They offer personal speakers that you can have at your table so you can pick which game to listen to while dining.
0	ZVtSz5vOsPDOTUElJFAgw	Small casino, but for a great deal on lunch/dinner ask for the 4.95 steak dinner special... comes with soup or salad. Not bad for 5 bucks!  Update: now the steak dinner comes with beer (or root beer) for $7 bucks!
0	TEnno5y4s38D1w7IzLUccA	Ok, so this place LOOKED great from an idea -- but I'm sorry, the prices are just waaaaaay over the top for a salad.  I spent over $10 to create my own salad -- and it was good, but certainly not worthy of the price tag.  I found the portion to be adequate for about $5.  The over all place is nice -- and unlike the other reviewer before me, the place was dead.  In fact, I go to that side of Decatur about 2-3 time per week, and there is NOBODY in there.  I think it won't last for another year... and I can see why.  In this current economy, most people won't pay $10 or more for a salad.  We all want to be healthy, but can you honestly justify the price?  No way.  Do yourself a favor -- go shopping and buy the groceries.  You can make yourself a much better salad at home for far less.  Sorry Salad Creations, but you're just not affordable for most people.
0	RTlo6QMRxnrUuYxp28yQAw	I called another Thai place today for take out only to find out they now close on Tuesday.  I remembered the King and I had their menu stuffed in the doors of the neighborhood about a week ago.  OK, on with Plan B.  I got their Curry Duck and my wife got the Chicken with garlic and black pepper sauce.  She got 0 for spiciness.  I asked the order taker what their scale was.  It's a 1 to 4 so I ordered it at 4.  She confirmed I wanted extra spicy, and we had a short wait before I drove to The Lakes to get the food.  I loved my duck.  Superb!  She gave me two containers with extra spice, and I used some of that, too.  Their 4 isn't really a four.  It would be about a 6 on a 1 to 10 scale.  My wife wasn't as fond with her dish.  It had the dreaded cilantro that she dislikes, and she refuses to stop being a kid, grow up, and learn to eat various types of food.  Oh well, opposites attract.  I'm glad we had the Tuesday closing.  Now I have two dependable and very good Thai restaurants nearby.
0	OTxWewKRMVXAo58VKmdg	While the name smacks of some sort of TGI McApplegarden, Rooster's Wood-Fired Kitchen is pleasant oasis in the middle of strip mall hell. This casual, nay, "relaxed" restaurant pays attention to detail, both in service and food preparation. Plates are served in tasting portions so this is the perfect place to go alone or with a big group. Definitely recommended.
0	VhMo1zaTaFN3rfVFqQwU6Q	Who says there aren't any see-and-be-seen places in Phoenix? Fez is trendy, chic and offers a delicious menu.  The burgers are hearty and packed with flavor and the martinis are mouthwatering. Be sure to try  the Pomegranitini.   The only downside is that with the lightrail construction, it can be somewhat of an obstacle course to get into this place so be sure to check fezoncentral.com for directions.
0	eegRNQ0HfFXIDCsxibJcAQ	This place is a 5 star if you go for dinner.  3 star or less if you go for lunch.  The vegetables at dinner time are so fresh and delicious.  My husband and son love the all you can eat steak.  The rolls are hot and delicious as is the banana pudding dessert.  Mmmmm..
0	SqQFojLGBREao3mk5P9FdA	Great place to eat if you're in the mood for a hot sandwich. I ordered the pastrami hot sandwich. The sauce and sauerkraut were awesome, and the bread was beautifully grilled. There was a ton of pastrami too - I wish they actually gave a little more bread for the sandwich.  It's self service - you order at the counter, pay, then pick up your food. All in all, highly recommended for a casual lunch bite, although fairly pricey for what you get (everything in Vegas is pricey).
0	abAHyZEjh6GKClvvgsGag	I was really hoping that this was the place that would crack the lousy pizza streak that I have encountered in the Phoenix metropolis. The place was called ray's, which is the gold standard for good pizza in New York, the cook said the owners are from NY (upstate I later learned) and things looked New Yorky from the photos. Ordered a large meatball (homemade and they were the best part) for about $16. Pizza wasn't cooked enough because the cheese shifted on the way home creating somewhat of a cheese tidal wave in one corner of the box. It looked good, but there was major issues with the crust. It was off and it didn't look like NY crust, it was breaking apart in the box and although it was foldable, too much cheese made it not a great fold after all. Basically, the bottom of the pizza was somehow undercooked as well and it just didn't work out well. Owner/Cook was a nice guy and will probably try a hero next time, but avoid the pizza and the search continues.
0	jRmL8yX9KRisPxphJEHfg	I was so excited when the new location finally opened in Mesa.  I have been a loyal fan of Beaver Choice, and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it.  Tonight, I was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience.   We had all placed our orders at the same time. The waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about 5-10 minutes to put the ticket inside.  We agreed.  Another friend came after we just placed the order, sat over 20 minutes without any type of service (no water or even a menu).  She had to get up to ask for them.  I know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends.  We all had to ask for refills many times.      After 1/2 hour of waiting, we noticed the tables around came after us got their food even few ate and left.  I felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time I visited in the Tempe location.  They had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too. However, the owner came out to our table to apologize.    This time when the owner came around to chat, we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left. By now, it's over an hour!   We are very patient people, others would have left by now.       The owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the POS receipt.  We knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt.  The owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook.  Again, I was loyal customer so I should know how long a normal schnitzel takes.  Over 1 hour is just unacceptable!  I felt I was in the episode of Amy's Baking Company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong.  I know the owner here is not Amy and Sammy. The family working in this establishment are much better than that.   I really hope tonight was just an one-time incident.
0	vMANO8AEnmaHSHkJ9urqlg	It's been too many years since I've eaten here to review the food, but I did recently spend an afternoon working in the space. But, for the record, I pretty much lived on their grilled turkey wrap when I was a WUD director. I don't think that item exists on their menu anymore, but it does make me want to try some other items.  Anyway, back to the present. The Lakefront is a bright space with ample seating and a panoramic lakefront view. There are a fair number of plugs available if you need to hunker down with a laptop for an extended period of time, and the light blue decor is soothing. For the most part, the Lakefront is quiet, save for lunch time when it fills up a bit more and people are more prone to chit-chat.   In the summer, the room offers a nice, air-conditioned and wind-free way to enjoy the lake when you're working, and in the winter you can still gaze out while being toasty warm. My biggest gripe is that the chairs aren't particularly comfortable for someone of my height - I couldn't use the backrest and still reach  my laptop on the table comfortably. Next time I may give the cushy chairs in the corner a go, but I don't really foresee better results.   If you need a place to work for a day and also grab a bite to eat on campus, the Lakefront is a good choice.
0	ySX8pmxtk8HXrhB270zA	The food is ok, typical Applebee's fare.  Nothing impressive, nothing wonderful, but good for the price.  Unfortunately, they've stopped doing the free kid's meals.  Oh well.  Far more of a factor though is the staff.  I've eaten at Applebee's locations around the nation, and this is some of the worst service I've had.  We waited approximately 45 seconds to be allowed to enter because some guests were chatting with one of the servers and blocking the entrance, ignoring us completely.  We were seated relatively quickly once we were in (the restaurant was only approximately half full).  Our server took a little longer than normal to arrive (approximately 2 minutes instead of the usual 15-45 seconds), so we were ready to order our food at this time.  We placed our order, and about 2 1/2 minutes later she came back with our drinks.  A very reasonable amount of time.  Our appetizer is brought out (by the way, they might be changing the marinara sauce recipe, it seemed closer to ketchup this time).  Our food is brought out, and by this point my wife and I have both nearly finished with our drinks, needing refills.  She ignores this.  The manager walks by multiple times and ignores us.  Other servers ignore us.  When I'm finally able to get our server's attention (after having seen her standing with another table's initial drinks and chatting with another server for several minutes), she scowls at me when I ask her for more drinks.  5 minutes later, she comes back out, scowls at me again, and then goes back to get our drinks.  We're done eating by now, but we finally get our drinks, and ask for our check (no chance of dessert at this point).  About 4 minutes later, our check arrives.  I have my card ready to go, she returns about 2 minutes later to pick it up.  9 minutes later (according to the time between the printout of the original receipt and the printout of the card authorization receipt), she returns with my card, and we leave.
0	O25QoryHF1ELjUiHnWEl6g	I love this place. Anywhere that offers a 2.5lb porterhouse is alright with me. Also, this is a sleeper pick for any top ten restaurant list in Las Vegas. The restaurant offers fine dining, asian fusion cuisine in a breathe-taking setting.
0	U7um2psxD0mOXjd7SXQdPg	Food here is ehhh. But the prepackaged food also kinda irked me. I'd rather see the chef prepare it or set my plate after I order it. Out of all the things I tried (sampled: kale salad, chipotle taco, crab cakes, bought: mock chicken wraps, and zucchini wrapped hummus) I only enjoyed the chipotle taco.  the items are really small for the price, and mainly just doesnt taste that good.   Like your mock chicken and crab should taste something like the meat its pretending to be right?   I just felt like a bird eating all those seeds.
0	kLgDoL8D8CMSTDx10I277Q	Not sure where Stan is from but where I'm from, a Deli is not a restaurant.... it is a deli.    Minus 1 star for deceiving me into expecting a legit Deli to appear on Mill.  minus 1 Star for not understanding what no cheese and no mayo means.  There are many places we have from where I'm from that has the gimmick of 3 pieces of bread.  They are called diners, not delis.    With only 3 other tables needing service I also expected a more attentive server that saw my tea was empty or notice that we needed more napkins because mayo and cheese occupied the original ones.   Even the thank you from the owner/manager was delayed, we were 100ft down the street when he hollered at us.  Hopefully they get it together, I do like independent spots on Mill, but I'm not so sure about a non-Deli Deli being the answer.
0	spstedP41C8NJj45j6mvw	Dear Cooper, I had higher hopes for you after viewing your menu online. I had higher hopes for you after walking into your space, obviously channeling what you thought was a gastropub but turned out to be just another pub with flavorless food. Why, Madison, why are you so afraid of flavor?!   Is that why the Jameson I ordered was so huge? (Thank you!) Is that why your beer list is so extensive and diverse? (Thank you again.) Because you expect your patrons to get well elixed before the food arrives? Let me tell you, the flavors of the food does NOT hold up to the flavors of your drinks.   I suppose I should have known not to order a Italian dish (polenta) off of a mostly Irish menu. It was not only bland, it was very hot. But not out of the pan hot, out from under the heat lamp / out of the microwave hot. I see you Cooper's, and it ain't nearly as hot as your food. My friend had the mac and cheese with pork belly on top. The mac and cheese, aside from the topper, was dull. So so dull. Not even as flavorfull as Annie's out of the box. Find the salt, it's on a shelf, about head high. And oh my lord this pork belly was awful tasting, when it wasn't chewy and tasteless. Neither dish was 1/2 finished when we were finished.   Drinks, people. This place is good for drinks and atmosphere and frites.
0	g86mR2pHQU9iFg5dyBeug	I order out from here at least once a week. Not the best sushi place I've ever eaten from, but still very delicious. I always get their Spicy Salmon Bowl and Hot and Sour Soup. Definitely worth trying out for anyone.
0	4PYsKl6fGHAIaIHTyxlZg	The fall theatre season has started at UNLV so I stopped here for dinner last night and had a great meal.  I did their Thursday Special of the Day, Barbicoa.  For $12.95, you get soup of the day - in this case it was an excellent cream of mushroom, the barbacoa, cubes of pot roast that are cooked in Mexican spices, rice, and whole beans.  When I asked about the spiciness of the barbacoa, the waiter said it was a red sauce with a little spice.  When informed that I liked spicy food, he said he'd tell them to make it spicier.  He did, it was, and boy did I like it.  Extra red cili seasonings gave a zip to the dish.  The beans were also well spiced and had some wonderful cotija cheese for garnish.  The rice was standard Mexican restaurant rice--nothing terribly good nor bad about it.  You also have your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  Service was excellent as usual.  This is a great place to eat, but it's a bonus when you an have a quiet, enjoyable, and reasonably priced meal before heading east on Flamingo to get to UNLV.
0	UmMVYEoNgHe0wmc6lbLw	I really liked this place!  Good service, friendly, and the food was quite tasty.  Appetizers, main dishes, the works.  All good.  I highly recommend Pink Pepper, and I know that I and my family will be back!
0	W5FweKLuoa30LNYsh8bxFA	I'm in search of a new 24 casino cafe with a good steak and eggs special. I started here, at the Grand Cafe in the Red Rock Hotel, because it is near my house.  Unfortunately, the steak and eggs here is a whopping 12.99, which puts it way out of the range of being affordable on an artist's budget. Fail.  The dessert bar here, however, looks really appealing.
0	ryavmkogRhQNGgUApi9CtQ	The wings were overly dry.  I don't understand how they can screw that up when there was a table of 3 done eating.  No one waiting for food when I walked in, and 1 carry out order called ahead.  Students were gone so it's not like the campus was buzzing.  The original hot wings are Tabasco flavored which is weak, UN-inspiring, and unoriginal.  The cajun wings had the cajun unevenly sprinkled on.  The fries had a very odd sweet taste to it.  I couldn't place it at the time, although it seemed familiar.  The only thing worthy of note was a large helping of bleu cheese came with the wings.
0	YeXsuyzhVKjAhjKtfAuhzQ	I like Feeney's. I must because I have been eating there for over 10 years. I like the owner of Feeney's (partially because his name is so much fun to say - Elias Pantazopoulos - but he will answer to Louie). Over the years, there have been very few times that Louie hasn't stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok. And although I would like to think it's because I'm special... it's really not. He genuinely cares about the people that come to his establishment and wants them to feel comfortable expressing their likes or suggestions.  This place is small and mostly dark (the perfect place for a quiet dinner with your someone special) without one iota of pretentiousness. The brick walls, archways, and dark wood accents give it a little bit of an East coast feel topped off with the tiled exhibition kitchen complete with a shiney copper hood.  The menu is mostly comprised of great steaks and sea food, but there are always a large selection of daily specials that are sure to mix things up. Most meals come with a trip to the salad bar... but beware, portions are pretty large, so make sure not to overload before your meal ever arrives. They have a full service bar up in front and if you are looking for a different game venue, grab a seat in there. The drinks are very reasonably priced, strong, and never run dry. They also have a hearty list of apps that you can supplement your drinks with, for the perfect game day fix.  If you haven't over-indulged with your meal, you MUST order the Mud Pie. It is a ginormous slab of goodness! Dark chocolate cookie crust, loaded with coffee ice cream and topped with a super fudgy ganache layer that you will want to rub all over your body.  Feeney's is a genuine rarity. It's a great little steakhouse that serves up above average meat but doesn't have a foo-foo bone in its body. Call ahead to make sure they have a table and head over to Feeney's. Oh and as Laura B. mentions, they are on restaurant.com so you can get a great deal on any meal.  I have to go now... there is a piece of pie calling my name!
0	nhNnmdgjCahhRQXaH3Mzag	This new concept of fast soup and salad service just doesn't make it for me.  I like the original Sweet Tomatoes full service soup and salad bar on Stephanie but this one just doesn't satisy.  I stopped in to get a quickie lunch and it was.  You have your choice of 6 soups and a salad that is custom made by the servers as you walk the line.  I got an 8 oz. cup of their delicious chicken noodle soup (including chunks of chicken) and simple salad.  The price with tax came to just over $11.00. No value here.  You can go to the soup and salad bar on Stephanie and for $8.99 get all the soup you can eat, all the salad you can eat (you make your own there), several different types of other salads such as macaroni, broccoli, cole slaw, etc., baked potatoes, pasta bar including mac and cheese, pizza, muffins and several desserts.That is an all you can eat buffet so the concept is what I'm used to at S.T. I didn't feel I got my money's worth at the Express.  Why didn't they put a full sized Sweet Tomatoes on this side of town?   We all agree we would have preferred that. With so many places to eat surrounding this one I can't imagine spending $11.00 for soup and salad.  Make no mistake, the  quality and freshness are still evident here; I just don't get the Express thing.  You can eat in - there are several booths inside, take it home or take it out on their  patio. The drawback is that the patio is located right on Eastern with all of the traffic and gas fumes along with the noise.  Not cool.  I live right up the road but won't go back.   I WILL continue to go to the original S.T. on Stephanie.
0	NKbDZahz1F4oWJQXiw3Q	Foodies beware of food poisoning.  My friend and I ate here late on 6/7/2012 and he experienced food poisoning  later that night.  I had the carnitas bowl with root bear and was fine.  He ordered the steak bowl and served himself a water with lemon. The only difference between our meals (besides the drinks) was that my bowl had corn and guacamole.  Neither one of us ate anything else after that so my guess is that the steak was bad.  Was it left out for too long or was is handled improperly?  Your guess is as good as mine.
0	YXxR5mPxiSpaD3ml2rXkaw	Just came from Brooklyn Pizza in Wesley Capel, this is the first review I have written but I think it's overdue.  We have gone to Brooklyn Pizza since it opened in Wesley Capel and before that the one on Rea Rd.  They start off great, as good as pizza can be  here in the Carolina's.  Then it begins, the short cuts start.  This time we noticed how chewy the crust has become.  Of course, they are pre-baking the crusts then covering them with whatever the customer orders.  I understand when it's bonkers crazy you have to find ways to get things done quickly but you had a good thing going and now we are out the door, looking for another "NY" style pizza place.  They seem to be opening one a week somewhere within driving distance.  Don't cut corners guys, don' t cheat the loyal faithful customers by counting the pieces of pepperoni slices like I heard one of the pizza maker guys say to a new guy one night.  Give us a good pie at a fair price and we will come back.  By the way your pizza is one of the most expensive around and just not worth it anymore.
0	shslEXtncBLyHDocGEifw	I have to say that I actually liked this location.  It is much better than the Chandler one because it was upbeat and the food, if possible, seemed better.  The service is a little slow, though.   It was a good place to kick back with the co-workers.
0	3fmfLHC0euUtHEq4kPGQ	Been here a few times with the family. However, today's trip left me with a bad taste in my mouth (literally). First, the burgers that we got were fresh except for the buns. The buns were stale and it was completely noticeable (hard as rocks). I would have returned to get replacement burgers, but I figured something might happen to my food given the attitude I experienced (explained next).   Second, the lady who took my order attempted to give me a combo meal instead of the individual items I ordered. So when I attempted to present the coupon I got in the mail, the guy who took over the drive-thru window had to call her back and have her swipe her card in order to process the coupon. Therefore, while guy was fixing the order on the register, the lady (turned out to be the manager) opened the window, said nothing, and shoved a drink in one hand and a bag of food in the other at me. I politely said, "Thank you," but I got nothing in response. I don't understand the rudeness. Her employee who took over the window (red-haired guy) was extremely polite and told me to have a great day, which kind of made up for her rude attitude.  All-in-all: The manager was the most rude person that I dealt with here.  However, as with any fast food place, the food is not always going to be what you expect, but you can likely skip the attitude I found here and go elsewhere.
0	CtVMp52YrqKSRiqotXg1A	This is one of those PT's stuck in the middle of a strip mall. It looks divey and sketchy from the outside. Inside, it is definitely a more rundown PT's, but otherwise isn't much different from every other PT's. And the karaoke set-up here is just odd - there's just really not enough room for it. The whole thing just feels awkward. When it comes down to it, though, I'd much rather hang at a different PT's.
0	MpGBd0MXEgS0NA8crDAxQ	We love this restaurant. Very tasty dishes. The wine store next door really makes this place a winner. You can buy the wine at very very reasonable prices and pay a $10 corking fee. David, the owner, manager, bus boy, host, DJ, bartender, etc. has above average wine recommendations and has never steered us wrong.   The food never fails to deliver good flavor. Portions are generous. Prices are reasonable. My favorite selling feature - it's in my neighborhood!  Check out Wednesday nights. Very nice atmosphere with great music. It's making the strip less enticing every day.
0	KhvAwU0XhRn1M7iwHb10A	I went here for St Patricks day after going to their website to see what they had going on.   Their site showed that they had a St Patty's day celebration with live music. It also showed they had happy hour DAILY and buy one dinner get one 50% off. We thought it would be a good place to have a beer or two and eat an early dinner.  When we arrived we found out that there was a $10 cover, no happy hour and no dinner discounts.  I would call that false advertisement.  We decided to stay since we had people meeting us but the place sucked. Even if we didn't have to pay the cover and got the discount I wouldn't go back. I'm from England so may have pretty lofty expectations as far as the food in concerned but it wasn't even close to authentic and the beers were coming out 75% full.  Unacceptable!
0	emzEmzWEOSHxbRiFryqz9Q	Tonight I attended the Yelp mixer organized by Andrew- the rsvp showed 10 people but being the social Yelpers that we are, over 20 people ended up showing up to check out the Vig Uptown. My friends and I ordered the crab/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious. The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter. He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.   I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes. So no more than 2 stars for lack of service . . .
0	Qsk3Gc7kUjG647kbzZlw	I've been here twice, and I was impressed with their pizza both times. The dining environment is cozy and laid back. The service wasn't the best, but the pizza was ready really fast and was delicious. My fiance and I shared a pitcher of good beer and two large specialty pizzas, and had plenty to take home for leftovers. I like their vegetarian selections.
0	VoEz2kfZthUydrWXA3ZIg	I try to make it over her for lunch at least once a month. The setting is so-so, but the smell and taste of the food make up for it. The bbq pork and chicken are very good, as well as the slaw and corn bread.
0	TX3P12q9c7CNW6Js7QGONA	Hmm, not really sold on this as a good place to have a drink. It's more set up as a restaurant. My friend and I were trying out various bars in Stockbridge as we never normally drink there and this one didn't quite hit the mark in terms of ambience. Not like Hamiltons did which manages both very well. No crisps! Bar food only or charcuterie meat which I watched the barman hack off a whole leg on the bar. Off putting! I had to order a bowl of chips to curb my munchies when some crisps would have done. You CAN get posh crisps you know.....   Anyway, I've not eaten here so this rating just reflects my experience of it not being the best choice to just have a drink.

Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.

I had to check it out, ASAP. And then come back, just to be sure. And then make one more visit to try something else. Now I can safely say that Restaurant 28 is one of my go-to spots.  They're known mainly for their barbecue, which is of the slightly smoky, sour variety of the Carolinas -- the sort I prefer. The red sauce is rather bland and ketchuppy. But the bottle on the table contains the plain vinegar and red pepper type I go for.  Be aware that their off the bone barbeque is not pulled, rather it is choppped, and dry. You do it up yourself, however you like.   My compadres (who hail from Louisiana) tend to opt for the fried catfish. They gave it very high marks -- crispy and a tad spicy.  Every side I have tried has been perfect, though I usually go for greens and beans.   Typically, I'm way too full to even consider dessert. But one time I did buy a whole sweet potato pie to make it home. It was excellent -- custardy and sweet.
0	Vw9OUAN5LU4ClPkwY21Q	OK, so I'm a sucker for the Old Vegas style.  The New Frontier has great room specials and sometimes you can get a HUGE suite for the same price as a room somewhere else.  (I'm serious -- it was bigger than my apartment in SF!)  They have $1 frozen margaritas downstairs and the biggest country bar in Vegas, complete with two-steppin' cowboys and their ladies.  It's hard to find food after midnight, but that's not why you're there...  http://www.frontierlv.com/
0	t0MNabJDELWfUBwZfLdZA	Tableau was a pleasant and much needed break from the loud and the neon .  We went there for brunch and sat on the patio which overlooked a highly manicured garden and small pool (built in entertainment included 50 something fat mob type with very young and very large fake boobed girlfriend who was obviously practically having sex with him in the pool at 11:30 in the morning because they connect spiritually).  What do you expect?  Anyways, beside that- this place was pretty good.  The service was very professional and competent, albeit a tad snooty.  I started with a bib salad on a bed of prosciutto garnished with pistachio encrusted spears of asparagus.  Then, being hungover and ravenous, could not resist the Kobe burger.  YUM.  Cooked medium rare, juicy, tender and flavorful.  It came with fries but I subbed for the chick pea onion rings.  SUPER crispy!  The ultimate indulgence.  Since my main man has been on an eggs benedict quest of sorts for a couple of years now- when he saw braised Kobe short rib eggs benedict on the menu, he almost had an aneurysm.   Needless to say, he found these quite satisfactory.
0	q8LmaxyatRw6H6UHLlHgYg	If you are looking for a delicious sandwich shop that's a step above the ordinary Subway and Quizmo's, then Capriotti's is the place to go. The first time I walked into this place, the staff behind the counter was super friendly. I told them I was a Capriotti's virgin and asked for some recommendations. The nice girl behind the counter suggested the "Capastrami" which is "Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw on a soft roll." How can one go wrong with that? "Sure thing" I fired back and we were off to a journey towards flavorful bliss.  I watch in anticipation as the sandwich maker spins his magic. About 7 minutes later, my name is called out and this masterpiece wrapped in white butcher paper is bestowed upon me. To make a long story short... I ate it. It was damn good. The pastrami was tender and the cole slaw and russian dressing ratio was perfect. The bread was soft and the whole sandwich warm and inviting. I didnt think I was going to eat the whole thing.... But damn it was good. I didnt want to take the risk of bringing half of it home and not letting the sandwich fulfill its destiny.  On my 2nd trip back I ordered the Bobbie and it was a little dry. Somehow I thought the turkey would be warm. It's served cold. It was still good nevertheless.  On my 3rd trip back I ordered the meatball sandwich. It was yummy... But somehow my heart still belongs to the Capastrami.  I included some pictures. Dang. How do you people write food reviews without getting hungry?!
0	XgunXyKyGJ7TSTAVvkTozg	Foo is just as good as the one in Manhattan.. you can eat for 4 days.. at least thats what I did.. Corned beef sandwich with russian dressing on the side..   order extra dressing, extra bread.. you are good to go.. I do in in manhattan too..   the atmosphere in vegas is fun.. but its vegas.. go to NY for a treat.
0	8rfdv419O3ayNsij6jPhJQ	Was craving KFC for a while, Love their Famous Bowl! However food is pricey for what you get it, they charge .39 if you pay with card and they don't take bills larger than a $20! They also take forever in Drive Thru!
0	ZeZFIpuRqxpn5pNsPA	Fantastique--Le Cirque at Las Vegas is a very Paris inspired interior.  Something I would expect from Sirio Maccioni a reincarnation of the venerable and amazing Le Cirque.  The Foie Gras was amazing, flawless.  The food was entirely fresh and the service was professional and nice.  A good environment topped off with a great wine makes for a spectacular evening.  Buen Provecho!
0	IIdwt8SZU1rrJ2fBCJixDg	Not understanding the vitriol of the other reviewer, because I thought this place was pretty darn good.  We did show up at an off hour, though, so maybe service is different when the place is crowded.  We ordered a salad plate with hummus, baba ganouj, and turkish eggplant salad, and all were delicious.  In fact, the baba ganouj was really smoky that suggested the eggplant being broiled over an open flame, which is something they don't always do in kosher restaurants.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Dinner was Shwarma with a side of shoestring fries dusted in seasoned salt and Israeli salad.  The shwarma wasn't cut from a big wheel the way it usually is, so I wouldn't even call it authentic shwarma, but was spiced with a really interesting combination of spices and grilled.  Not sure what was in it, but it was definitely more turmeric than paprika.  It was delicious, and but for the few little bits of turkey gristle we got with it, I would call it perfect.  Drinks include Spring (Israeli juice drink) and several varities of soda.  Service is friendly and prompt.  Portions are huge (one appetizer platter and one entree were more than enough for our family of four).
0	AugNeShGq5cDnyi0sl7WQ	I work right around the corner and was glad when Ikos opened up.  I would go there at least once a week for lunch. I even had my birthday lunch there. BUT, they've had a consultant come in....  the menu has totally changed, the prices have gone up by a big leap AND you still get your meal served on a plastic plate with plastic utensils.  While I'll miss the food, I won't pay $11 (not including a beverage) for a mid-week lunch.
0	zYbNORbPfKDhCwCR55196g	Best cheesesteak in town.  The bread is baked fresh and delivered everyday specifically for the cheesesteaks.  The meat is to die for, thinly sliced right off the eye of round and then fried up in its own fat.  Tell them to lightly toast the bread and you'll have a foodgasm.
0	GeSw2NavanujUhf0XuNUjA	Lost points for a couple reasons. Took a group there for lunch and 3 of us ordered iced green tea, only to find out that the tea was not brewed yet and it would take a while.  So we ended up ordering bottled water.  Then 3 of the 6 ordered the pork dish, only to find out they are out of pork.  So they get teriyaki.    My ramen was tasty and the kimchee fried rice was great.  But the service and stock needs a little work.
0	hpQvPgNJdMDGyriOya6zA	Can't say I'm impressed with the Cosmo food scene. There's better tapas at Firefly. The hidden pizza joint next door is a more satisfying meal.   The Cosmo better step it up food wise. It's highway robbery for very so-so quality food. They obviously want more of a vibe than a great place to eat. Great food gets return customers. Everyone on that 3rd floor are in for a surprise in a year from now....
0	wsCBhmaH9XToHRCZ7WdGvg	We had a gift card for this place so thought we'd take my husband's parents and check it out. It was pretty good. The decor is old but that's fine with me...I wasn't there to get interior decorating tips:) Between the 4 of us we had the London Broil, Chicken Fried Steak, and Walnut Chicken Salad. The Chicken Fried Steak and London Broil came with HUGE salads, side of veggies, and a potatoe side. The Walnut Chicken Salad was big too and all 3 came with the yummiest cheddar biscuits I have ever had. There was more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites! All of the food was tasty and had a homemade feel to it...not a processed, pre-packaged feel. There was hardly anyone in there when we went but by the time we left a few more tables filled up. Even though there was only one waitress she still served us promptly. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. We had our little 8 month old with us and it was the perfect low-key place to take her out to. We will definitely be returning again.
0	DO14WlAerQL40hbV87Lw	The food here was fine, but not outstanding.  Favourites included the calamari and paella.   We didn't like the Tapa de Salsichas or beef dishes as much.  The restaurant was quite loud, with a DJ playing EDM all evening.  Later in the evening, he started playing more 90s hip-hop and dance.  I'm not quite sure why the would have a loud DJ with no dancing.  It was a bit annoying.
0	fwuNvlfsADnG0FGrPGIQ	I recently stayed at South Point and it was awesome! They gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for the lunch buffet and the service was awesome. The food was so so, BUT THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE. They refilled our drinks constantly and were polite. The food I would give 2-3 stars, but the service and deal made the experience even better.
0	5h2vZqZRa4jK2uHGDrvA	Ideal lunch at Dotty's in downtown Madison: Spotted Cow with fried cheese curds (only in Wisconsin!) followed by English Garlic sauce burger with chili cheese fries.  After that, you might as well go home because you're certainly not getting anything done at the office anymore. Pretty good burgers (buns are too small), great tap beer selection, and fantastic chili cheese fries.
0	C26Vw0Low0y2UakthHIp3Q	This is the legendary stuff in CU.  Some people love it, some tolerate it, but many yearn for it years after they leave campus.  The place can get very busy, I usually call ahead and carry out since the space itself is loud and frankly not too memorable.  I love the tomato sauce and cheese taste.  Many people overlook the thin crust, which I like, esp. when I don't want the volume of the pan.  The stuffed is too much for me.  Surprisingly, the sandwiches are a cut above what you would expect at a place like this - an afterthought.  A note:  Years ago they used to have a location on Wright. St. where they sold sandwiches and slices.  That was nice, and convenient.  Wish they could do something like that again.  Maybe take over the McDonald's spot in the Union food court.  Honestly  - how could McDonald's not be successful there?  It seemed busy whenever I was there.
0	jSGspZO8iTpVfX8DOm4fg	I stop by this place on one of my business stay at Mandalay before catching an early evening show, which if you're doing similar, just want to find a place for a quick bite, I'd highly recommend, the bar in front has a good selection of beer, bartender were attentative,  you get to enjoy your meal, the nicely cooked burger, while watching the TVs throughout, then head on to your next thing at LV.
0	U96VUgfXbbltEz8kkzHg	Nice decor, spacious with a modern Greek feel. The white brick background gives the bar a good appeal. The staff are great and go out of there way to make your dining a good experience. Unfortunately those are all the good things that's good about this place. As with any new opening, food is mediocre and nothing to rave about. Not impressed at all. It's too soon to tell if this will be a hit but hope it will as service is excellent.
0	lQhQ0BVGdxGfT5Dma7bz3w	I guess this is your new typical giant suburban sports bar. There is nothing about this place which is particularly interesting including the beer choices and the food choices. The service was good once we got past the ineptitude and confusion at the front door. They were trying to charge us a ten dollar cover charge because there was some kind of fight on the TV. As if i care.
0	jUmOPEJOkdBcx16qvHBQ	The City is underground and not so easy to find, but it's a neat, laid back place  +Trivia Night on Monday!  Be sure to check out their Twitter page beforehand to find out the bonus question ahead of time - The City doesn't really have too many great drink specials, but does have an alright selection of beers.  I've always had fun and chatty bartenders there + Comfy lounge chairs, booths available, plenty of tvs  Overall, it's a nice, laid back place (especially on Trivia Night Mondays) with okay drink specials but good drinks nonetheless
0	ZqbvRZohVSxu5NGH3vIMQ	The food was quite good, though the breaded monkfish was a bit disappointing. Make sure you sit in such a way that you're not looking at the "window." Who wants to feel like they're eating in a mall?
0	CadQBIAKVXxc3aohvEWg	Sushi mon is the best!  I knocked down one star since the two owners split and when they did, they decided to even split the menu! =(  For an all you and eat place, this place takes the prize!  For a little less than $30, you get a wide variety of special rolls and sushi!  The sushi is really fresh surprisingly for an all you can eat place!  Like every other sushi places, the waiters and chefs are always nice and friendly!  The rolls that they have are really big!  They also provide the option of getting half a roll if you don't want the whole one!  When I say they have a wide variety, I really do mean they have a wide variety!!  They have mochi which is of course always great and they have friend tempura ice cream!  This place is a must go to place if you're in the area! It's not on or near the strip however, it's more of a local place!
0	XAdPOgYAzvgrs6d31InKJA	I had my first visit to Hugo's Cellar this past weekend and throughly enjoyed it. My bf and I went with another couple who had previously dined here before on several occasions. As we entered, both Karen and I received a long stemmed red rose which I found hilarious for some reason.  My dirty martini was pretty damn good and so was the bacon wrapped filet mignon served on crab legs along with garlic mashed potatoes. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the table side salad. Our salad maker, I think was named Kenny? made a great salad and I had every damn topping short of onions that he offered.   The only thing we missed out on was dessert but time was an issue. I'd definitely recommend going here for the "old-school" steak experience, especially with good friends who can appreciate the vibe...
0	hMoOdoOQMh83uPdjpIZHg	My favorite place.  I love their Tostada Salad lines so much. I love the salsa also.  I miss the caramel Fran, which is no longer available. Chicken is also good.  Sure I often visit there for.  One downside is I feel their Ice tea does not taste well to me.
0	NFsRwPEBuMxX2hsS0OixA	I was so excited to find a Chinese food place near me and by the yelp reviews I thought this place is worth a try. I got the combo lo mein, orange chicken, crab Rangoon and egg rolls. The lo mein noodles were very tasty but the chicken, beef and especially the shrimp were not very good. Lacked flavor and the shrimp tasted really fishy. The orange chicken had no flavor and the tempura coating was soggy. I will say the crab Rangoon was delicious and the egg rolls were tasty as well. Unfortunately although the guy working there was nice I won't be returning here. My search continues!
0	eS8zyFJFZm3afieXAXJoow	I came here with my boyfriend after reading a bunch of reviews on here... and I wasn't disappointed.   First off there was a sign in the front that says no one under 21 allowed. Being that people said it was a family friendly place, we were kind of confused. We called them up and the lady was super nice and said it was no problem if we came in and ate. That definitely made us feel better.   We ordered a French Dip, a Geebee Burger, and the potato skins for takeout (back to the comfort in our worldmark condo timeshare). The lady, Diana, was super quick about everything and asked us if we needed anything yadda yadda yadda. She brought us out some water while we waited for our food.   Our food was ready in about ten minutes which isn't so bad because you get to look at the totally cheesy yet lovable decor.   Big warning about this place: there are no sidewalks to it and there is no crosswalk to it either. From the worldmark, you have to walk down the street then cross three crosswalks to form a uturn shape and then walk on the bike lane. Pretty lame.   Totally worth it though.   PS: even after walking all the way down the street, taking three crosswalks, and walking back down the street (in the rain)... our food was still blazing hot once we got back.
0	t6fhOQmN5PolTqPgWzbAg	I bought 32.00 worth fried chicken along with side items today. I requested a couple of dipping sauces and was charged an additional, roughly .50 cents for each dipping sauce.  Furthermore, FYI - This Popeyes franchisee does not give free refils on purchased fountain drinks. This experiance feels like the Popeyes in Comptom, not the Popeyes in Las Vegas.  #ComptonPopeyes #popeyes #revokehislicense #popeyesfranchise #popeyesfranchisee #popeyeslasvegas #popeyesexcaliber
0	Ol6PtkEKFr4laiILFpFg	This one is for you Jer.... Mr. Mac I hear migrated from the mother land of wings(buffalo). Now I like pizza, I have been a long time conasaur of wings. I have sampled a good 100 or so wings from the Anchor Bar. The establishment that claims started this delicacy. Johnny could use bat wings battered and dipped in his wingy sauce and I would still think they are taste o' licious. Some sauces are meant to be sopped up with your left over pizza crust and Mac's is on that list. I travel a good 30miles round trip to partake on his wingy dingies. Make sure you ask for extra sauce on your babies because the secret is in the sauce when it comes to wings. The meat is meaty also, you rarely ever get that bastard stepchild of a wing all small over crisp and retarded. Mac's is on my list when I think of purchasing wings for myself or chowing down with the guys. Shalom Johnny Macs.
0	FVS1ycAenlUlSn8XEgPA	This place has really good fried fish. I would have to say the batter is what really makes it delish. It's a light, but seasoned batter which really makes a difference. I am not sure how anyone is their right mind could compare their fried fish to the very frozen flavorless crap that pete's sell. A better comparison would be papa joe's.   Fried fish done right at marilyns!
0	5gFLwDNU4J8yYsOea6lVQ	I must update this review.. This place is on the way out.. It went from 5 stars to 2!!! The managers and the best bartender have bailed and their service has gone to *beep*.   I knew they were trying to change into more of a bar than a restaurant but come on guys.. I have ordered the lettuce wraps multiple times here and they have always been excellent.  They brought out medium size raggity old spinach leaves and lower quality cold beef.. Twice..  Ughhh.. Im so disappointed.  Especially because it is in such a good location.   Sorry guys. It actually pains me to write this.  I was waiting weeks to write this and gave it multiple second chances.. I even got ROTD for my 5 star review of this place.. Ugh!  -Ian M.
0	g4Dsi099wFSUCAobVYNQg	Excellent lunch specials here; $4 buys you two slices of pizza and a drink! The readymade pizzas are usually cheese, sausage and pepperoni (they have feature pizza's that rotate throughout the week). For a little more money you can even add wings or a salad. The service can be hit or miss (don't expect a clean table during lunch rush hours). The sauce is more on the savory/acidic side than sweet which I like and they're never stingy with the toppings. Warning- it may be a little greasy so don't be afraid to dab off the access grease with a napkin; your heart will thank you years from now.
0	Xdgx7sVstVxfkJqUKiANw	I worked for a Lebanese family for a few years.  I love good Mediterranean food.  Hedary's is some of the best in town. The food is a strong 4 Stars for me. They have my favorite variety of pita bread...the fresh, warm, pillow-like pita bread that demands that you start your meal with Hummus or Baba Ganoush.  Service can be a little off at times and not very communicative when you are waiting for food or needing something. They usually get it right in the end, but I tend to feel uneasy too often.
0	jghZFhPa2BGExV7XU2IVQg	It's been awhile since theirs been a review. Went for fish tacos. They by far the best in Las Vegas. Service is prompt and courteous. Order was "right on".  Fish comes on two tacos a bed of cabbage, with diced tomatoes/onion and celantro and a white sauce. They are delicious. This is a seafood restaurant. Everything is freshly made to order. Whatever you order you will enjoy. For the price you can't go wrong. Fish tacos are 3.00 each....go for it.
0	gZV6aAKR9yXwPBEKeg5Q	Not sure what the other review has to do with this subway.   This one is a great improvement to the store that was in this shopping mall previously.   The kids that run it do a good job of moving the customers.   With $5 sandwiches it's always busy.   The bread and ingredients seem fresh each time we have had lunch....
0	K7j5Zd1VaNybas7GZQikhQ	i dined here a few weeks ago, during my stay at the Wynn.  Bartolotta is near the shops at the Wynn.  I dined with a party of 7, however, one of the members of our group was not exactly dressed well -- the waitress provided him with a dinner jacket.  I got a large Lasagnette con Ragu di Crostacei, which was delicious -- and so fresh.  Great place for a date or a business dinner, but we warned, this place is pricey!
0	JW7YWostypYQT2XXXdevww	The food here is average for a breakfast/lunch caf\u00e9.   My only problem is that they (as in the employees at the caf\u00e9) do not give you what you exactly order. Now, I know this is not a big deal, but it irks me when I place an order and tell them what I specifically do not want, and they give it to me anyway.   For example, the first time I stopped here for breakfast, I asked for just bacon and eggs. No potato and no bread. I told them that I couldn't eat it and that I don't mind paying extra for items that I will not be receiving. Of course when my food came out, what did I have on my plate, potatoes and bread. Sadly I had to waste the food and throw it away. This could have been simply avoided if they actually listed to me.   Then the second time I came here for breakfast (I thought I would give it a second chance) I said the same thing. I even told them about my first experience and they promised me that they would not give me potatoes and bread. But of course when it came out, I got it. What is so hard to understand that someone does not want bread or potatoes, I am sure it's a common thing. Many people request this all the time. I mean come on - what if I was allegoric and this was touching all my food. I guess I would have to throw away my whole $15 breakfast???  Needless to say, I learned my lesson and when elsewhere for breakfast for the rest of the week.
0	zBdPne4mdVcpZMvqyzkfA	One of the first Thai places in Vegas that my husband and I had tried.  We've tried a lot more since, but every once in a while we find our way back here.  There is only a couple of tables occupied, and service is always great and today was no exception, our order was taken and our drinks brought out.  Within a matter of minutes our food began to arrive, I got the ruby chicken, deep fried, stuffed served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, mixed with red peppers, onion and pineapple pieces.   And it comes with fried rice with shrimp.  My husband got the beef sa-te with peanut dipping sauce and we split them both.  We also shared pad thai noddles.  The food was fresh, just enough spice and served pipping hot
0	MV2IZzEeZdDNQPLKbsS4fQ	My favorite restaurant at Sky Harbor.....  I've been meaning to check out the original El Bravo location in Phoenix, as I've been so happy with this little counter-service airport version of it.  They really have a great selection of burritos and other fast casual Mexican food items.  Even the bean and cheese burrito is tasty!  (Everyone who knows me knows that this is probably the first thing I'll try at any casual Mexican restaurant).  It was the perfect delivery mechanism for El Bravo's rich salsa roja (the red stuff).  El Bravo is an all around good place, and it's leaps and bounds above the rest of the chain options in the airport.  One little nitpicky note about this place..... I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up recently.  They didn't seem exorbitant, but competitive, which was a huge disappointment.  This place used to be pretty cheap.
0	1iqeFe4OmqZ7tIXoo9g0nA	I've been here a few times and couldn't resist the temptation when I saw a yelp deal for Phoenicia.  I'm a huge fan of this style of food and they do everything very well here.  The two times I have come here my gf and I split some ginormous sampler for 2 (or more realistically - 4).  You get to try almost everything and it is all very good.  We took 2 full large containers home as leftover, and leave stuffed for around $30 when adding in our iced teas.  The yelp deal dropped that down considerably.  But, I have paid full price for it before, and I will again, it was just icing on the cake I got it on sale.    I don't have to send a lot of time describing the food, most people know the main stuff.  It is all quite tasty here and the service is always top notch.  Meat is moist, and everything has good flavor.  What more are we looking for, right?  There is some high quality places in the area and I think Phoenicia holds its own.  I literally drive past 5-10 of them to get here, that must say something.
0	fUkOuS9GJG0GPpJW4gwtOg	The food was average but consistent. Have eaten here a few times due to limited sit down options at the airport. The service is very slow. I don't think it is the servers fault but the management. They are under staffed which creates the issue.
0	HiQZPXuswDhoC1Tg21bfw	Simple menu makes for good food.  I first had Five Guys a couple years ago iwhen I was still fresh out of college, but this location is fairly new along with the Trader Joe's and other stores in this area.  Burgers here are always made well and just how you like them.  If you order fries, get ready for a nice huge bag of fries.  They are freshly cut (the location of where the potatoes come from that day are on the wall).  I've had the cajun fries too... which are great if you want a little kick to your fries.  Staff is friendly and the service is quick.  Good combination when you are in a hurry for lunch or just in a hurry to get a burger in your stomach!
0	s99jp2Knbn82hmNz6t6O2Q	Went during lunch on a Saturday and were the only people in the restaurant which should have clued us in. Don't get me wrong, the food was "okay" but for the price and service, not worth it. They kept bringing us the wrong drinks and then added extra dishes to our check that we didn't order. We think it was from the one other couple that came in after us....anyway, I got the drunken noodles and asked for medium spice, but I swear it was mild.
0	oWbhiDa7XQMZZwZEYux6w	Have you ever seen the show "Restaurant Impossible?"  That's all I could think of while I was here.  If I had been walking in out of curiosity alone, I would have turned back around before anyone would have had the chance to seat us.  The restaurant looked tired and worn and the people that were already eating there didn't look too happy.  So why did I stick around?  Well, I got a deal from KSHP AM 1400 and thought it would be nice to have breakfast up on Mt Charleston.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't check the reviews on Yelp beforehand, nor did I check my coupon- lunch and dinner only.  I could have waited until lunch, but I already psyched myself up to get some breakfast.  So I decided to stick this one out.  I ordered the waffle breakfast, my husband the pancakes.  They both came with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes on the side.  While we were waiting for our food, that's when I started to notice the "Restaurant Impossible"-ness to this place.  The walls were repainted, but only from the floor to about 6 feet up.  The rest of the walls (which are actually pretty tall) were still the older color of paint.  I could see the paint difference where they removed light fixtures.  The carpet was very worn and the chairs were out of style.  The windows needed cleaned pretty badly.  I started to wonder how clean the kitchen was.  Robert Irvine would love this place.  As for the food, it wasn't great and it wasn't terrible.  Just some pretty standard waffles, pancakes, and eggs.  The potatoes were incredibly salty though, and that was the only "seasoning" I could taste on them.  For what you get, the food is overpriced.  Basically the place was ok.  It will do if you are hungry on Mt Charleston or staying at the Resort.
0	VwFQsGbl6aljhf0tfRxgNg	I have been here 3 times. This place is so-so. The food isn't great, and the service is just ok. It's OK to go for a few drinks and halfway decent food. Just don't expect anything great to happen from this place.
0	pTpof9GjAtMrF87IYUQcjw	Got an email a couple weeks ago advertising the bikini contest, went last night and was surprised to see an unadvertised $5 cover charge.  Waited in line to get in and when I got to the front I was told it was $5 cash only, if you had a card you had to use the ATM.  The ATM charged $2.99 on top of whatever fees your bank charges so this would easily bump the cover charge over $10.  The fact that you got a coupon to use next month for paying does not matter.  I can't imagine that the people hosting this have ever run an event before.  It would be trivial to include the cover charge in your emails, that way people wouldn't get annoyed when they see the signs for it and leave (saw 3 groups of 3-5 people see it and walk off in 10 minutes waiting).  It would also be trivial to pay with a card, your business takes cards so this can only be a way to gouge your customers with fees.  Finally please work on your parking, people were having to park in other businesses' lots to get over to Twin Peaks, these places were still open at the time and it is quite rude of you to not account for that.  Food wise I've been before and was quite happy with the basic cheeseburger and staffing is hit and miss, I've had great service and then merely okay. Management on the other hand clearly has a lot of room to improve.

I am a lover of appetizers and seafood (yes, even at a steakhouse), so it would only make sense that i order the seafood appetizer. Oh my goodness, it was an incredible sampler of crab legs and shrimp and all that good stuff. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted as fresh as seafood can taste. I barely had any room left for my filet mignon! But I did...i always do. Haha.   As for my steak, it was as good as i had hoped. It was prepared medium-rare EXACTLY. This is great because I have been to places where medium rare = rare or well. Oh no, not here. The center was the perfect shade of dark pink. LOVELY. The sides are pretty awesome, too. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are a must.
0	iX4QYcF1E7FPVizEzMufg	It's very basic. Slotting in with a menu less expensive than Big Bad Burger Daddy's it shows in some places. For example my order of a Buffalo Burger & Coke came in a paper cup & tray. For such a dining experience at The Penguin that's expected. That Charlotte institution's diviness & grit are part of its charm. But Burger Co. has nice wooden tables & chairs, flat panel TVs galore, and obvious effort put into it's decor. For the operational cost cutting to be present in such an obvious way it is an off note.  Unfortunately this night they were out of the sweet potato fries ($2.50) & the waitress confirmed their tater tots are frozen in contrast to the freshly ground burgers. So how was it? The Buffalo Burger ($5) of buffalo wing sauce, bleu cheese, celery strips is a novel flavor combination & a differentiator from Burger Co's rivals. They were other such options available on the menu. The burger arrived perfectly hot with a soft warm bun. The meat was good though plain & a nice thickness that isn't skimping nor requiring genetics of an anaconda. Generally Burger Co. is a good tasty meal & a welcome addition to the west end but it doesn't feel much different than stopping at Cook Out on the way home.
0	Vv77zI4RNT8lL1eNN7x1wA	Love C4....It's the best!!  Great Vibe, great wine selection, impressive selection of beer, and if your'e like me (prefer a martini over wine) they make a good martini too!!  I find the menu to be a nice compliment to the wine.  How can go on with out mentioning the coffee... "Cowboy beans rock!!"   The owner's really work hard to create an upscale environment while not losing that good ole' "Cave Creek welcome home feeling" everyone loves so much. They've made recent improvements to the ambiance, and it's my opinion that they have just about perfected it!  I am so excited for their future success!  The Concerts in "The Camp" are a real treat, you will be amazed at the amount of talent that exists in the world! concerts in the "Camp" are worth the drive for sure.  These nights are great date nights, even if you've never heard of the artist, go anyway... you will be surprised at how cool and interactive, this small venue can be.  I reserve the fifth star for service.  I find that the service has been inconsistent in the past, but I'm hopeful that with the recent changes, the service will improve.  It is easy to forgive a server for a bad night as long as they serve with a friendly heart.  I will update this post after a few visits.  I am hoping to give C4 5 stars!
0	ZMd0mXlu6ywYuQu4BtBw	The happy hour is slammin!!   Happy hour is EVERYDAY from 4-7pm. They have half off all wine, well, and HUGE draft beers (only $3).  The appetizers are also half off. I have tried the Mediterranean Fondue and the Flat Iron Steak Crustini. I WAS SHOCKED. The fondue was good, but the star is the steak crustini. It was so good and only $4.50.   I like that the bar is completely separate from the dining room. I have not had lunch or dinner yet.   I cannot believe this place is not busier for happy hour. I think I might become a regular.
0	EONUQSfOXR8nKYtkHoHvA	I've been a Trekkie (that's right, vintage Trekkie, NOT new ageTrekker) for 35 years.   I have every episode of every series on dvd, as well as every movie.  Also collect NIB or MOC action figures (over 325 of them).  Have never been to a Star Trek convention, and I don't wear the uniforms and pointy ears and all that nonsense.  That being said, I couldn't wait for an opportunity to visit Star Trek:  The Experience.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen until March, 2007, with a return visit in July, 2008.......but now it's gone!!  What other reason could there be to visit the off-strip Hilton??    This was a Trekkie's paradise.  A bit pricey I thought, but lots of paraphernalia to examine (uniforms, props, gadgets, and aliens).  I thought both rides were pretty cool too.  I spent a long time gawking at everything on display.    Quark's bar was quite different too....but the service sucked when I was there.    Heard some rumors that the attraction was going to be re-constituted in some form at the Neonpolis downtown on Fremont St.    I sure hope so.  In the meantime, RIP Star Trek:  The Experience.
0	XJWnCN7MyMptXKg03kLwAA	While I was staying at the Hotel Valley Ho, ZuzZu became my mini-office and my home base for some breakfast comfort-food.   The decor here, as in the rest of the hotel, is really late 50's/early 60's influenced. I love the look of everything from the chairs to the coffee mugs. The outdoor area has bright orange umbrellas and sweet little potted flowers adorning each table.   I only had breakfast options, but each hit the spot. My first day, I had their home made granola w/cranberries and apricots, with yogurt on the side. The granola was really top notch, and the dried fruit was plentiful, no searching for it among the grains. The second morning, I opted for the strawberry waffles, which were nice and fluffy. I don't make big demands of my waffles -- they just have to be hot and right texture -- and these were juuust right.  In addition tot he strawberries, they also came with an orange curd, which I ordered on the side -- a really nice touch!  I'm not sure if the orange or pineapple juice that I had was fresh-squeezed.  I somehow don't think that it was, but was tasty nonetheless.  My servers both days were extremely attentive and sweet.    I really loved the fact that the hotel's free wi-fi worked here.  It make it a great spot to work while eating, and also to sit in on/host meetings. The only downfall in this department was the lack of outlets.  However, they probably don't want you whiling away your whole afternoon there, even if you *are* a hotel guest, so perhaps that's for the best!
0	BiV81Edq9LiqrrBzmXX2HQ	This used to be an A-OK restaurant when they first opened. Who doesn't like a square burger and have it cooked to order?  Been coming here on and off since day ONE. Usually the food is pretty tolerable and it gets me to my next location - Wally World. Just park the car in the middle of the parking lot and you only have to get out of the car once.  This location seems to always be a little tricky. The French Fries are normally cold and we have to go up and ask for some fresh ones. The Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches are not too bad depending on the roll of the dice and whether it is a full moon or not.  Service is rather poor and the inside could probably use a makeover. Today they asked me for my name and somehow they interpreted (Mark) for Bark. Could this just have been a Freudian slip or are we making Dog noises at me?  It almost seems that ever since the famous Dave Thomas left the picture this place has just gone downhill in general. Plus we miss the old lady with the white hair in the commercials. Ok ... WHERE"S THE BEEF?  2.25 STARS
0	DWtWRRT8HjVaMFFcormvig	It's on campus, and convenient. It isn't as good as other panda express I've been to, in the recipes they use are a little different than other pandas as well. One thing I don't like is that they charge for refills of soda pop. This is the first hand I've ever been to the charges for refills. The food comes in a to-go box and not on a plate which I am ambivalent about but the menu selection is very limited compared to other panda express. I've eaten here when the items in the hot table really look old and quite nasty, Other times the food actually looks fresh-ish.
0	qyk9jIKhXb9gWlGERQKsPw	Will definitely be coming back, if only because they actually serve congee.  For real, honest to goodness congee.  Not watered down congee, or overly thick congee.  Just right. (although, they could have cut up the preserved egg a little more).  Pea shoots were a little over salted, but those are so delicious that I don't care how I get it.  We also had gong chao ngo ho (that's beef with wide noodles), which was good, but the sauce was a little on the sweet side.  Too bad that they don't have fresh roast Chinese meats.  But whatever.  A real Cantonese restaurant that I can come to whenever I'm feeling a craving!  Now THAT'S something to be happy about.
0	MaOtIswEhCgCQm5dwyjYw	We really enjoyed this meal. I started out with a salad and the main course was the linguini with prawns.  The pasta is homemade and you can taste the difference.  My wife had a ravioli dish that she loved.  It was a success.
0	Fqqs8gn158tCsv0k2mRbUw	We ordered the 30pc special, which included an order of fries, medium ranch dressing and 2 drinks for $22.95. We got the Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan and Hot &  Sweet wings. The Lemon pepper were the best out of the three.  They had a pretty good flavor to them. The garlic parmesan were pretty plan. Not very garlicky or parmesany. The Hot & Sweet were neither hot or sweet. The wings overall were a bit on the dry side. Maybe a little overcooked. The fries were ok. We also ordered an order of the Funnel Cake fries but the picture looked better than what they really tasted like. Overall, I think I'll get my wings elsewhere.
0	0CUMD15dntXAW1Jo249REw	Needed somewhere near the office and happened to find Bonos via Google Maps. As soon as I saw the menu I knew I had to try it out. Called in an order for a Rueben and it was ready by the time I got there (maybe 10 minutes, if not less). It came untoasted (which was specified in the menu, toasting and extras have to be requested) but it was delicious. They also threw in some "Atomic" horseradish which was a little tamer than they had warned, but not for the faint of heart.  I will *ABSOLUTELY* be coming back here. The first meal was great and the prices are amazing. $5 for a 10" pizza too? (At the time of this writing) and they've got some great specials if you ask/are inside.
0	p59jr72NLFG4b2mfHAVQ	I'm surprised with several of the comments here. I live in the neighborhood and have eaten at Zen quite a few times over the last year and a half. The service is excellent as a rule and the staff very pleasant and unpretentious. It's nicely decorated, and except for street noise al fresco and parking lot light glare at night at a few inside tables, the ambiance is both contemporary and comfortable.   Of course the menu selection is varied in this theme and most of the dishes are memorable in taste and beautifully presented. I find the prices reasonable for most selections and the price fair given the food quality, service, and atmosphere. If price is an issue, sign up for their email list when there and you'll get discount offers from them routinely.
0	1DKKTR7P9t592qDJ8UHig	Nanay Gloria's has really turned me on to Filipino food.  Walking into this small buffet style restaurant makes me feel as though I'm in the Pillipines..! It's hot and humid in there and there is a television on the wall streaming either a soap opera or "wow-wow-wee" (a game show).    Good ol' filipino comfort foods such chicken adobo, sinigang, fried mackerels, and other braised meats and veg.  The look of it all is not so appealing but once you get a taste, there's so much flavor and depth to each dish, not to mention a lot of fatty goodness.  If you're lucky you'll find lechon or sisig, a filipino delicacy of crispy fried pork belly.    The day to day offerings at Nanay Gloria's varies but that is what makes it exciting.   Every now and then they will have Ta-ho... a soft tofu desert with brown syrup and black tapioca balls. My favorite..  Nanay Gloria's is what filipino food is all about...
0	H1yxdXg7oBspGnCXrgqPg	Roomie and i plan to hit one of the restaurant.com spots ( i have 8 coupons left ) - she's up for thai so we make the trek to Mix Zone on Charleston - sad to say they're CLOSED ! We then decide on Rosemary's start driving up Charleston, we see Hush Puppy - she likes the sign, " can we go there ? " uhhh, yeah , sure   I've seen the sign several times, but never went in - i didn't even know it's a restaurant !   walk in place is hoppin' - busy and loud ! get a menu, the server there in seconds for drink orders, i ask , how long you guys been here ? 35 YEARS !! oh, ok.   Southern food with an emphasis on frying - cat fish, oysters, shrimp, etc. For $13 get the all you can eat catfish filets and shrimp with fries and a salad bar - a grease fest !!! Roomie gets the cajun plate - blacken catfish, oysters and grilled shrimp - also $13 also comes with salad bar and she opts for the collard greens.   Salad Bar ? big bowl of greens, big bowl of coleslaw, big plate of sliced pickles, then bowls of the lil veggies - loved that they had the pseudo -bacon bits ! This place cracks me up !   my food - very greasy ! i stick with the catfish filets - not too greasy and some of the fillets are decent - nice crunch yet tender on the inside.   the blackened catfish ain't bad.   If you go into this place with the right attitude and expectation - it's worth a try - very reasonably priced, too.
0	6dvfBtiUTNBykbYKI8aw5w	Overpriced. Food was cold. Chile Relleno came out with cold cheese inside. Entrees came out at different times. When I told the waiter the draft beer he gave me wasn't dos equis he argued with me. The manager thinking he was doing us a favor gave us free flan for dessert. I don't care for flan.
0	o9TSivf2OqeXPojFdEYA	This place is delicious. The chicken finger sandwich is huge and the veggies on it seemed very fresh and crisp.  Great fingers, great sauce, good place to eat.  The owner was very nice and I felt very happy to help him out.  It is a small business, kind of hard to find (next to FYE), but this is way better than any drive-thru place.  Go check it out.
0	1ODWxtF6FFq2U5tuqYPJg	Susan and I went there for lunch today to try someplace different. We were very impressed. We both had the stuffed meatloaf and would definitely go back for it again. Service was terrific. Prices are reasonable. The wine selection could use some improvement or I would be giving it 5 stars. The building is really neat and seems to attract a lot of seniors. We didn't try the famous "salad room" but it looked like almost everyone else was.
0	nZSZqVIUUgvEtgoDyMQ8tg	Excellent Indian food. I wish this restaurant was here in Atlanta. Copper takes Indian cuisine to the next level. Presentation is outstanding and you can taste each unique flavor. That's pretty rare for Indian food which usually has a lot of intense flavors that are hard to decipher. We shared samosas as appetizers and I ordered the rack of lamb medium rare. It was divine. When I am visiting Charlotte next I will make it out to Copper once again!
0	EHtfYk0aRZAxbNMjP8X1g	I read the other reviews and some were similar if not spot on.  I went here for my Birthday (Mid February) The ambiance was great and fortunately for us the company was even better. The decor and feel of the restaurant is awesome and what I'm looking for in a quality chop house.  The service was good however, like Tanya's review our waiter didn't know anything about the wine.  Unfortunately, the food didn't hold up to what I hoped it would be.  I got the Pork Chop.  It was a solid piece of meat however it was dry and lacked the flavor I was hoping for.  Additionally, my baked potato was not fully cooked and I couldn't eat it?  My wife got the chicken which she was happy with but her side of mac n cheese was super dry as well.  The company we were with got the fillet.  It was OK but for $38 I was expecting it to be great.  Ive had better steaks for a lot less.  Anyhow, I was really hoping it would be great but the food was well below expectations.  Very doubtful Ill go back, Id rather go to Flemings or Houston's.
0	kJnbvshaLHNachzdlcvg	* I don't know if this is the page for the La Salsa that I went to, since there is another one on Yelp nearby. *  For something on the Strip, expect it to be pricey, of course. However, a sign outside that said "2 FOR 1 CORONAS" caught my eye, so that drew me in. The prices are a bit higher than I would normally pay for Mexican food. However, the food was seemingly a lot better than I had expected. The burrito ranchero I ordered burst with the fillings when I cut into it. I got it with carnitas, which I am glad I did, because the meat was great. In the end, our group ordered three entrees and 4 Coronas for the price of 2, and our bill was just under $60. I guess we got lucky and got the better quality service, because I really can't complain about anything during our visit.
0	LFSfUak6t1E7SJJNEILUg	Horrible beer selection, but the old meck brewery beers are good. Parking is a rough situation. Service wasn't that great as far as good went, but the bartender was great. Waited an hour for one order of kabobs, but they were amazing. Manager apologized and comped it, but still a ridiculous wait to be one of four tables in there.
0	0RvqUbw1eVyIBQpzbIdrA	First, NO atmosphere.  After working at the Clarendon for as long as I did, I recommended Fattoush quite a few times and never heard a bad word about it. But, honestly, I rarely stray further west than 15th avenue as general practice. Lucky for me, I was broke and at the will of my paying lunch partner, and he took me here (it's Ben from the Clar, FYI... here's proof that he's as into non-chain and local joints as most of us yelpers... and we drove there in his p-i-m-pin Prius... owoooo).  We had virtually the same thing and were both very pleased with it. The humus is very, very good. Incredibly smooth and flavorful.  Lentil soup also gets incredible thumbs up.
0	Zt8S82czBvwDJTlfBlpN8w	I should let you know that I have a very basic list of requirements in a bar: attractive lady bartenders, ice-cold beers, good service, low prices. THAT'S IT. I love having a million tv's all over the place, but that seems like an extra perk to me. Having said that.... I love PT's.  This particular location is semi-close to work, so sometimes we drop in to grab a drink after work. I only ever get a beer or two before heading out for other things, so I cannot complain too much about prices or anything like that. However, I showed up last Sat at like 5pm with a buddy, and all drinks were half-priced with their loyalty card. We had a lot of Jack and Coke's for like $30, which was a great deal. I was totally happy with the price, the drinks flowed well, and the lady bartender was hot. Happy camper, right?   Mostly. At first, they were quick to keep giving us new drinks. Towards the end, they tapered off really quick. I could've totally had another drink had they offered, but I sobered up and realized the best thing would be for me to stop.   Still, I'll be back.
0	TFso9UPbXFe0jHGdoJvbRQ	I really want to like Dillinger's. We live in the neighborhood and find ourselves considering it often for a quick bite and burger. Each time we've gone, the waitstaff has been nice, albeit distracted by tending to the bar area in addition to our table. Other reviewers have praised the burgers and I'll second that. I ordered a veggie burger on our first visit -- when our food was delivered, I took a bite and knew it wasn't a veggie burger but kept on going. So good. Be warned. They do have fifty beers on tap. But they're frequently behind the seasonal ball with taps that were relevant two months ago. The last time I was there, I ordered a beer, only to have the waitstaff come back, apologize, and say they were out. We went through this twice more, dipping into my B-team beer choices before finding one they actually had on tap. I'm not a beer snob, but if a large beer selection is going to be your calling card, you have to own it and not let that one thing slide. Because of this, we now think twice before walking over there. Second warning: If you are not a fan of death metal, just know this is what will probably be playing when you get there and probably be playing when you leave. We now know to pay attention to what's playing when you walk in because there will be NO variety in the music. Which may be great for some, but not for us. On the plus side, it's never hard to get a table at Dillinger's. Possibly because it's a specific clientele that's frequenting this tasty burger joint.
0	YJnJ4cK0HfwGiilW6rWOQ	This must be a old address, the new address is 4955 E Craig Rd.   We ordered the rib tip dinner with greens, mac and cheese with a hot link. Where do I start? The "rib tips" was just a bunch of chopped up rib meat, no tips, the meat was dry and some peices burnt. The greens had no flavor other then.vinagery, the mac and cheese was dry and very bland, the hot link taste like one of the red links you buy in the huge packs at the grocery store with the casing took off. Food was bad and most went in the trash..  The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is the workers was nice and.when you are walking past the aroma coming from the smoking pit outside is great..
0	pBPBDft1ZQbHtIpi3rXXCg	I'm all about some Los Favs.  I usually get the California Asada burrito which is super legit, and I'm actually a fan of their fish tacos too (not for everyone) and not as awesome as their burritos/dillas but they are good especially with their green hot sauce.  Also the breakfast burritos are off the hook, everyone I know loves those.  Plus the best part is it is cheap, quick and close by.
0	uTmNWEIAcdAYnfeQpbMg	Sometimes i love when i don't check Yelp before going somewhere because i may have glanced at the 2-star rating and moved on. We ended up here at the end of a great, uncrowded day at Carowinds drawn in of course by the $5.99 buffet (with drink purchase) sign, dollar more if you just want water.  As you enter there is a very attractive bar to the right and around the way a large dining area..   There were three different pastas that i thought were very good, as were the meatballs. Excellent breadsticks. The sauteed veggies were tasty too. Pizza was just average in my book.  The buffet had a good selection of pizza and pasta, as well as a salad bar and some dessert breadsticks.   Our server was on top of every drink refill and quick to take away dirty plates. The kind of buffet service that deserves a good tip despite having to get your own food. Manning the buffet was a little old Italian lady who was on top of anything running low. In my head, she must have been responsible for bringing her recipes all the way from Italy.   For a dollar more than you'd pay at CiCi's pizza (i think), this place was a perfect way to fill up after a day at Carowinds. As much as you want Italian goodness for a fair price.
0	2sp2wugcI2bShh8Kg93UQg	This review was from restaurant week. We ate at Steenbock on Friday night and were very disappointed in the quality of the food.  I had the soup which was by far the best part of the whole meal.  The other 3 people in our group had the risotto which lacked flavor. They ran out of the Halibut by 6:45 which was extremely disappointing since that was the main reason I wanted to go there.  Of the four of us 2 had the steak and the other 2 had lamb, both of which were very disappointing.  I would never buy either cut of meat if I was cooking it at home. The lamb wasn't a chop, it looked like a shank and was tough and hard to eat, almost no meat. It was served over beans that seemed to need more cooking. The steak was extremely gristly  and fatty, I could not eat it, but it was served with goat cheese potatoes and capellini onions that were both really good.  The banana foster creme brulee was gritty, molten chocolate cake was over done there was no lava in the middle and the pretzel ice cream was just a marble size dollop of soggy pretzels, no ice cream to speak of.  What a joke!  To top it of they only served wine and beer which I did not want and we were seated in bar area which is cold and has no ambience.  Overall it was a major disappointment and way over priced.
0	wkWEiklQ4ecx5eFj42pQ	My friends spoke HIGHLY of Binkley's so when I finally went on New Years Eve, I had HIGH expectations. The service was superb and we were greeted, seated, and served immediately with a reservation. We got the New Years Eve 7 course meal with "surprises" which took about 2 hours to consume. I enjoy the unique presentation.. some odd liquid potato soup in test tubes (mine tasted burnt, my husband claims his was fine), funky fish and mushroom soup in a bag. It's hard to remember what they actually were with their fancy words but it was all tasty enough and overall FUN & UNIQUE experience. The mango ball sak thing was super!!!! As far as taste, I've had more mouth watering mind-blowing food at other top restaurants, but I'm super glad I experienced Binkley's.
0	KsRHuhjI51dp0kEE2oKOQ	True Cantonese style. Taste good and prices are very good. Come here quite often for my wonton noodle soup, roast duck, salt and pepper shrimp, and beef chow fun. Friendly wait staff. Prefer coming here over Sam Woo (tourist trap).
0	O0a54Y1Cs2v7EltCXHsQ	My order was disappointing. I ordered a quesadilla which came in a big box, but when I opened it I was shocked to see 4 small pieces. (See picture)  For the price (almost $8), I should have bought  a pizza.
0	QdcfFxk3S1sAAOBzUILT4g	This place doesn't compare to the Two Hippies on 16th St. This place seems to always be empty or closed. The staff is not as friendly either. While I was there another couple came in and waited 5 min before they got any service and then left empty handed. Just a word of advice you need to make sure every customer leaves with something if you expect this place to remain open. I live 3 blocks away from this one and will drive to 16th St. one if I'm in the mood for Hippies again.  7/14/2011 Steph H who is one of the owners who wrote a review above mine I'm sure to get the ratings up, which Yelp frowns upon if you read the print in the comment block.  Steph H sent me an email because she didn't like what I saw with my own eyes and simply stated my OPINION which is what Yelp is about simply stating ones OPINION of ones vistit to ones business. Anybody knows business 101 the customer is always right.  With todays economy Steph H you should be doing everything possible to make sure all your customers are satisfied with there visit to your establishment.
0	cMEAWx3jPTcgqRgBCqYZg	Recht gro\u00dfer Imbiss mit vielen frischen Gerichten und (so weit ich das beurteilen konnte) freundlicher Bedienung. Leider gibt es auch hier nur den Standard Hackfleischd\u00f6ner und daf\u00fcr bin ich bekanntlich nicht zu haben. Warum sollte ich mich mit weniger als einem ordentlichen Kalbsd\u00f6ner zufrieden geben, der aus ordentlichen Fleischlappen geschichtet wurde? Dann geh doch lieber ein paar Meter weiter und hol mir eine deutsche Currywurst :-) Der Laden ist nicht schlecht, da es aber in Karlsruhe ausreichend bessere Spie\u00dfe gibt, wird man mich hier nicht antreffen.
0	R1kPZHZGfQpWSmXzw8PA	I really wanted to LOVE this place because of all the good reviews here and because of the reviews is why we went there tonight. Sometimes I wonder if relatives give these places the 4-5 star reviews.  I will say the place was clean and tidy and the counter girl was pleasant. I don't like cafeteria style restaurants, especially at $12.00 a plate. Only thing good about an order yourself place is I don't tip.  I ordered the BBQ pork and it was bbq'd right to the skewer so I had to eat it with my hands. It was over cooked, rubbery and way to thin. However, it did have a good flavor. The macaroni salad was very good and they were happy to replace the rice with a green salad at no extra cost.  The short ribs were very tough and cut thin, again the flavor was good. The coconut shrimp tasted like it was just ordinary frozen restaurant fare, nothing special. I really wanted to like this place as we need more family run places and not chain eateries. We were there from 5:30 to 6:30 and we were the only ones in the place the whole time. Too bad. Oh yeah, it took a long time to get our food being we were the only patrons . I may try it again and order the chicken.
0	HHfmRD0FduLsXhZknfvIA	I wanted to like this place, I love Jamaican food.  I had the jerk chicken which is a whopping $10.95, with cabbage and rice n peas, chicken has ok flavor, rice and peas kind of dry with ok flavor, and cabbage meh, I ate only about 20% of my food the rest went to the garbage!!  Also tried a beef patty the filling was delicious, but the crust was so hard I pretty much only ate the middle, well that was a $15.00 lesson.    I have been to Jamaica and ate traditional food made by friends and this is nothing like it, so I am sorry to say I will not be going back, maybe other things on the menu are better?  Area is not so great either.
0	Yi4Q7frBYXSyyNnkMCOU9g	The Plaza doesn't have the best fries ever.  It doesn't have the best food ever.  Plaza sauce is great on my burger, but it's not the most amazing burger ever.  You can find similar drink specials anywhere in Madison.  Sometimes there's a stupid line that you have to wait in.    So what is so great about The Plaza?  Two words:  Bubble Hockey.  Flash back to 1983.  The Cold War ended but there's still tension and resentment between USA and USSR.  What better way to settle things than on the ice?  We all know how the 1980 Olympic game turned out...  (I'll sound really stupid if the teams aren't USA v. USSR and are UW v. someone else instead.  I just can't remember.  Too many beers...)  Always good times and good memories at The Plaza.
0	DPBCMAOPai76I9SYHHWw	Can we just keep this between ourselves? They just don't need any more customers to form a line at Sushi Ken.  I lived in Japan for four years. My husband is Japanese, & we've picked apart every sushi restaurant in the East Valley(not on Yelp, though). I should make a list.  This is where we eat sushi. We live @ 40 minutes away & drive in for a meal.(Though with the price of gas...)  In the price:freshness ratio of good sushi, Sushi Ken has it made.  It's like a real Japanese family restaurant. Giant menus with a little of everything on it. Want sushi? Got it! Kids only eat noodles? Got it! Sister-in-law doesn't eat fish? Got it! Just like home, there's something for everyone.   In addition, the sushi is actually good, fresh & plentiful. Plus, if you can read Japanese there's little signs posted around with specialties like negitoro donburi, my favorite.  Here's a little story; We've been married almost 33 years. I'm ashamed to say that until my last trip to Japan in 2004 I didn't like sushi. At the great Tsukigi Fish Market, I ate my first negitoro donburi & fell in love. I even had it as my last meal at the airport before we left Japan, and my husband has taught himself to make it for me at home.(good guy!) It was life changing!  So go to Sushi Ken, and enjoy! But let's just keep it between us so there's still some negitoro for me!
0	TB0dvsotgiZlRpRWz8i3yA	I don't know why there are positive reviews for this place. We got delivery from them the other night. Remarkably unremarkable.  Their Fragrant Beef is just wrong. Not at all spicy, and the beef is weird.  Imperial Gardens East's version is MUCH better. The Triple Delight was mostly palm, and the shrimp that was in there, were tiny.  All in all, meh.
0	Y6IBZiXGS7WwMvIFEc11w	I want this pizza to be better than it is, if they could change a few things it probably would be as good as they claim.   I gave them a fair shake and waited to write this review after ordering from them 4 times.   Thin crust Pizza should be CRISP, mine was a soggy undercooked mess drowning in sauce, and skimping on toppings.   Original crust Pizza was also undercooked and drowning in sauce with a lack of toppings, some of which they even forgot.   -PLEASE use a light hand when saucing the pizzas and don't just squirt a pile of BBQ sauce on from the bottle, it should be evenly applied with a ladle and a swirl too.    How does the pizza have time to cook when it arrives literally 15 minutes after I hang up the phone?  I'm more concerned about quality than I am about your speedy delivery.   -PLEASE take the time to thoroughly cook those pizzas!   It seems when I order a pizza with meat for my man it's loaded with meat but when I order a veggie one for myself they tend to be stingy, especially with mushrooms for some reason.   -PLEASE be generous with the veggies if I order a pizza with no cheese or meat!   Fresh Herbs mean just that, FRESH, but when they are put on the pizza before baking they shrivel up and dry out and lose all flavor.   -PLEASE Put Herbs on the Pizza once it has come out of the oven!!    One more thing, PLEASE have your phone staff go through some more training.   I'm not giving up on you NAKED, but next time I order it will have to be in person so things are done right.   Let's get those stars up!
0	5G5HtCRU47qGyRtij0kVoQ	One of the few highlights of the Fremont Street area.  It's like a Wall Street type steakhouse, with friendly staff and good food.    It doesn't rate 4 stars on a national level, but it's head and shoulders above the competition within a 5 mile radius of Fremont St.
0	vC8QpBWsSAewCOMJlst6Cw	One Mississipi.... Two Mississipi.... Three Mississipi........Holy $H!T they're here already! Whether you are getting it delivered or ordering in store Jimmy John's is the fastest gun in the West. Insanely efficient and incredibly delicious. Jimmy John's never disappoints with the food or service, and prices on par with the major chains. If you are a fan of the toasted sub (as I am) next time you are considering Quiznos, or Port of Subs, skip it and hit up Jimmy John's, especially if you are in a hurry! I still give the crown to Capriotti's for Chain Sandwich shop, but Jimmy John's is definitely a close second. I recommend the Big John extra toasted (for the carnivore) or The Beach Club (if you like something lighter).
0	MJHOU3nGXvPAhRg8GsgYg	This restaurant was disappointing..  The place is new and looked OK but lacked ambiance.  The help was courteous but seemed inexperienced.  The steak was sub-par in tenderness and very diffcult on the digestive system.  VERY spicy.  I like spicy food but this steak went over the top to the point of making one nauseous.  Both husbands felt the same way.  One of the wives had a lobster and she thought it one of the best from a steakhouse chain.  The other wife had a chicken salad which we also very good.  Maybe I'll go back for the lobster but never for steak.
0	IcJZh1nNWDcC2JoiVG5EA	I've been eating at the Shroom since they opened their doors in 1974.  With that being said, I also realize my expectations are high and nostalgia plays a part too.    This is a great location and I really want to see them do well but they have a long way to go in my book.  This Shroom opened on Monday BUT this place sucks!    The pizza has too much cheese on it.  Literally covered with 2 fingers deep of cheese.  You cannot taste anything else.  Server was ok.  Their beer list is awesome!  The decor and ambiance is good.  The inside is super big and nice.  I'll be back again to see if they are Shroom worthy!
0	tkUbVemwGVC6MtKlfZKQ	I love Ru Sans!  I love the sushi, I love the decor, I love that at lunch I can eat all the sushi that I want for $10. I like the part of town it's in, and how you're greeted when you come in and when you leave. There are other sushi places in town, but I keep going back to Ru Sans.
0	qOloLB5FlzsEN8PFzURNHg	Oregano's gets my vote for best pizookie ever. Their pizza is great, but the pizookie is what sets this place apart. Eating outside in AZ during the hot weather never sounds like a good idea, but it's tolerable under the misters here. Too bad the wait is so long, but so it goes. If you can't drive down to Chandler for BJ's, this is probably the next best bet.
0	UR6MH35bwIcr0RNfYhXiZA	Excellent food at a great price.  I had the pleasure of going during their Sunday buffet.  What a treat.  $8.99 for all you can eat Gyros, rice, chicken, meatballs, hummus, fruit, lentil soup, stuffed grape leaves, pita, etc., etc..... the food was all very fresh and wonderfully seasoned.    The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  Their food is all home made and you can tell by the excellent taste.  Their lemon aid is fantastic, I highly recommend it.
0	DxIVnmXMQDYjC4zoqkBOAQ	The newspaper gave a great write up about a local chef who came back to open a new Italian Restaurant. It doesn't feel like a traditional Italian restaurant since no lasagna, eggplant , or parmesan are on the menu. The menu is like going thru  gauntlets since they don't talk about the sides (or the prices), so it is up to your imagination as to what you get with your entree and what the price is.  Bottom like - VERY MEDIOCRE and no where near the hype....  We can do much better at the Italian Grotto
0	tObfJTyq7KybPhYPOpcfjg	This Taco Bell is hit or miss. I LOVE Taco Bell and this is the only location I have ever not enjoyed. It seems that the afternoon/evening shift is the best time to go but still, it's hit and miss for me. They often forget my sauce packets, the 7 layer burrito is more often than not 2 layers of just guac and sour cream with a tiny bit of beans, the bean burritos almost never have cheese. It is very close to where I live so I have gone multiple times and will probably go again many times but it's not my favorite Taco Bell.
0	jwoTjmd146EO0lnI4983Q	I'm a fan of any place you can get 24 hour sushi!  We frequent LaHaina quite often.  Really yummy rolls.  My favorite is the Hot and Wild roll.  They must put crack in their garlic ponzu sauce because I can't get enough of it.  Service is hit or miss, but the few times it's been a miss, it's been really busy with just one server so I understand that.  Not saying it's ideal, but whatever.  Overall, I highly recommend it!
0	KvLHqwSRBpJ0c8V3KLpA	My salad was good but had things on it that weren't listed on the menu so had to pick it off. My husband had the taco salad and won't ever get that if we go back because it was covered in chili that he didn't care for. Not sure if we will give it another chance. It was average.
0	HFlFqZJNa9USQexPEHWUTQ	Love this place. It's probably what you would call a hole in the wall, but aren't those places usually the best? Both owners, wonderful people, always remember you, always smile and always go out of their way to accommodate you. You want to swap sides? No problem. I always eat lamb strips over Basati rice with lentils and roasted onions. I swap the cucumber sauce with a homemade red sauce with lots of garlic and sauteed onions.... Too big to eat and I take it home for only $6. I top it off with homemade tapioca pudding, topped with cinnamon and Pistachios. Sometimes I go in for a morning bagel. They recently switched to a different bakery and man..... those bagels are phenomenal. You can get them plain, cream cheese, different kind of egg sandwiches or some unusual ones such as the Hudson, which is Salmon, Cream Cheese, Capers and Cucumbers. Such a treat. Hope they will be around for a while since the economy is tough and lots of places around them don't make it. Location is good, NW corner of Lone Mountain and Decatur, right across from Vons. Go there and see for yourself that the smallest places usually come with the biggest surprises.
0	gAuES1GcaYhzWeEYtSnQ	For those Las Vegans who may remember the great food from North Beach Cafe, well Ozzie is back, running the restaurant of the same name inside Bogey's Bar. We've been twice now, and all our favorites on on the menu: we have tried caprese, house salad, chicken Marsala, fish of the day (Basa), salmon, and a fettuccini pizza, all were really good. Wine was very reasonably priced, and the cool bar seating is still there.   The gaming bar is on the other side, so the dining area was nice and quiet and relaxed, good for conversation with family. Great neighborhood gem.
0	sKu20eIWLV8FBQ8qR7z3hw	Great ambience especially happy hour (5-7pm) with low-key  live music. Happy hour is a great value at $5 per drink or appetizer.  Loved the braised pulled pork sliders, fried chicken on waffle, chicken pot pie and pear martini. Would love to come back to try dinner some time.
0	XhnwWHQPrdXNpuDD4K6qyw	I discovered this Domino's Pizzas a while back tucked away inside a Sinclair/7-11 gas station and finally remembered to check it out. I placed an order online during the March Madness basketball games this weekend and was given a 14 min ETA. When I arrived at the store about 15 min later, my pizza was done as promised so I paid and was on my way back to continue watching basketball.   I ordered a medium Honolulu Hawaiian pan pizza and the 1st thing I noticed when holding the box was that it was a little heavier than usual. When I opened the box I was pleased to find a pizza that was covered in a generous amount of toppings that put other pizza chains to shame. Well that explains why the box was so heavy! Overall the pizza was tasty although some parts of the crust could've used a few more min of cook time since it still tasted a little doughy  This location is smaller and inside a gas station so only carry-out is available, no deliveries. They are running a special where you can get menu items for $5.99 each (including medium 2 topping pizzas) as long as you order 2 or more from that list
0	jXlW8Bq0DNaY7GIzT4bRoQ	I've eaten here twice.  Once for lunch 2 years ago, and once for dinner 2 weeks ago.  I have to say that I really like this buffet.  There's nothing fancy or gourmet about it, but maybe that's what keeps the "down-home" menu consistently good.  Small selection at the salad bar, but the romaine lettuce mix was fresh and they had beets.  My favorite section is the BBQ.  The pork spareribs were baked to a delicious tenderness.  Sauce is served on the side.  Mac n cheese was  bright orange, creamy, and cheesy.  LOVED IT!  Other sides were simple but good.  The sign at the register said $13.99 for dinner but they were charging $16.99 that night (because it was Christmas week?).  We used our $1 off Gold card, so it was a good meal deal.
0	10Qfooraf2RS8PQC1nY9g	Great location, but I have to say that the food, not so good.  I have visited this place two times and tried different types of meals.  First time I had a spicy tuna roll with Jalepenos and the the rice was extra warm which should be at room temperature, then I had the the Reman noodle with pork.  The Noodles were under cooked, stiff like chalk and the broth was SO-SO.....  Second time around I had Chicken Katsu which was over cooked, hard, and barely any chicken I felt like I was eating bread crumbs. and the soup was luke warm.  Just not my cup of tea.  NYC and SFO have better places and so much more REASONABLE..  The second time around my meal nearly cost me $19.  Comparable to Kyoto bowl but double in price.  :/
0	CPWKpmbcIqjwMdaUkFD1A	Yes, it pains me to write this but it has been a long time coming.  I have been a life long fan of the 'Dane" and have basically grew up with it...starting in college when it first opened in 1994.  It was always a place you could count on for outstanding beers and very solid food.  Unfortunately, this is no more.  The beers, once different and unique, are now pedestrian at best.  The Scotch Ale no longer has the flavor and finish that it used to.  The specials are "special" in name alone.  One can only conclude that cheaper ingredients and the large growth has caught up to them.  Same can be said about the food.  Always a big fan of the calamari with banana peppers, the appetizer now is overbreaded, overcooked, and lacks flavor. The same can't be said about the Texarkana burger.  Piled high with bacon, onion straws and slathered with BBQ sauce, the burger was juicy and flavorful.  A small highlight in an otherwise gloomy night.    For a visual perspective, the Fitchburg location is appealing and comfortable.  The dark wood in the bar and high ceilings make it welcoming.  I will say the dining room feels more like a Dennys that a brewpub however.  In 1994, the Dane was something new and different on the Madison restaurant scene.  Craft brews were still new and the concept of a brewpub was as well.  They did well establishing themselves and now it appears they are content to rest on their laurels.    With restaurants/bars/gastropubs sprinkled all throughout Madison that serve better beer and better fare, the Dane best wake up and improve or just locate in other cities (like Wausau) where the competition isn't as fierce.
0	HC2EoInunz0hRCfT4w	Yummy, yummy, yummy barbecued pork ribs! I always get the Regular Ribs - 1/3 Slab Platter with a baked potato instead of the sides (which are blah). The corn on the cob and corn bread muffin that come with the Platter are delicious as well. My husband enjoys the Texas Beef Brisket.  So far, I haven't found another BBQ restaurant in the Valley that's better!  UPDATE: I still really like the BBQ here, but we prefer the Mesa Riverview location as it's less busy. Hmm, I'm downgrading from a previous 5-star. That was probably a bit crazy anyway. : )
0	eZVg9CWaLc1AvWva0s79sA	Great coffee shop that has recently expanded to dinner service on select days.  While  I haven't had dinner here, I can tell you that their breakfast sandwiches and pastry are excellent.  Try their O.M.I--an egg sandwich with a curry sauce.
0	8gmPgc6oFige3RNIJTlA	One of Las Vegas's newest hot spots - the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa.  This review is based on their Sand Bar and the entertainment events they host by the pool.  Arriving into the desert was "A Tribe Called Quest."  The setting, a huge outdoor pool with giant beds for outdoor lounging.  If you hope to score one of these beds to enjoy your concert experience, expect to get there early.  They are definitely hard to come by.    With alcohol sold poolside, you can still bring your previously purchased drinks into the concert area.  (They'll pour your drink into a plastic cup, that's all.)  A stage is put up for the performing artists and with its general admission, feel free to get up close and personal by making your way to the front.  If you arrive too late, plan on spending time in the way back.  With the pool being right in the middle of the venue, your only options are the front, sides or way back.    With it being September and with the headliners hitting the stage at 9 pm, it wasn't too hot outside.    Overall, Red Rock Casino Resort Spa is a pretty cool place.  Locals and tourists frequent the place as it's off the strip and not readily accessible to those who don't know about it.
0	D9SqHczTrCwvsF795PIWbQ	My friends and I differentiate between our two favourite Chinese places in C-U: The "really good one" (Lai Lai) and "the really fast one" (Empire).  Lai Lai is a bit spartan in its set up, but if you want a great selection, central location, and a delicious menu, hit it up.  I think it's ideal for a lunch time meet up with people from the university, and the tea dispenser is rather convenient.  Enjoy.
0	kLGcRstFxmDaoYmJyhVA2Q	This restaurant is in an unexpected area of North Las Vegas. Best AYCE sushi for $26.95 (dinner) "in North Las Vegas" we've ever had. Their tuna, salmon, and yellow tail were all very fresh. We tried the 911 spicy tuna roll and it literally made us cry. Keep in mind, we're no whimps when it comes to spice. FYI, free all you can drink beer and sake on Mondays and Tuesdays with an AYCE purchase.  Make sure the waitress gets the order right, or else they bring you more food than you can eat ... which they will charge you for (they have a sign for that).
0	C6uORGfN2hO8LeZF2FGGCA	I had heard some good things about this place for sometime and wanted to try it out. My girlfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night. The ambience is nice when you walk in. Has a nice water feature in the middle of the restaurant. We noticed the place was absolutely dead. There was one other couple there at 8pm. We wondered why it was so empty. We would find out once we started eating. We started with the sugar cane shrimp which was pretty good. It was unique. For entrees we ordered Pad Thai and Pad Panang Neau Gai. The entrees were just horrible! I love Pad Thai and eat it any chance I get. Their version of Pad Thai had some horrific flavoring, honestly tasted like Chef Boy R De sauce was used. The Pad Panang dish was just a trainwreck! It had chicken, peppers, coconut milk sauce and some kind of spice..It seriously tasted like the smell of dish detergent. My girlfriend and I love Thai food, but this had to be one of the worst meals we both have ever had. The server didn't seem to care although she did take the trainwreck dish off our bill. We left as soon as we could. No wonder why this place was empty.
0	Qi8i5DItPJ4kTndWkk1NQ	I met an old friend here for sushi last night and was stuffed! these guys have a wide variety of rolls with different seafoods, textures, and temperatures. their spicy tuna is nicely seasoned and all of their food was impeccably fresh.  also, my friend told me that these guys aced their health food inspection which i know is important to some of you yelpers.  minus one star only because they close at 10. with good food and lots of beer i usually want to stay out later. so go here, but don't go too late, or you will accidentally waste your spicy tuna too.
0	f0SH33XGUZK4AiAmyrwQ	This place is pretty cool.  Nice set up, people are nice.  Food is pretty good for bar food and the mixed drinks are strong.   I like how the bar is split... the tv side is separated by a middle patio for the smokers and then the other side is the pool, darts and other bar games.  There's poker nights and other games too.  Some places give me the heebie jeebies, but I don't get that from this one.
0	CGufPZF8pcwjje0CFbzuA	Just dined at Sierra Bonita again, and felt the need to jot a few notes.  First, Liz has been my server the last three times I've been there.  Keep up the good work, and note to manangement:  Keep Liz!  but you already know that.  she has the rare ability to make you feel well attended to, yet doesn't overdo it.  she has a genuine unfaked warmth and remembers everyone's names! today I tried the green corn tamale appetizer and the Five Spice Chicken sandwich, with a side salad.  the tamale is very good, hearty, moist and flavorful with a green chile sauce.  it is much better than its boring tex-mex counterpart you'd get at your typical Mexican place.  the sandwich is a very flavorful, marinated chicken breast, seared to crispiness, with bacon and some Mexican cheese over the top, with a flavored mayo not only adding a lot of savor to the sandwich but keeping it moist as well.  I'm too full to finish it but finish it I do, because it's that tasty.  Try Sierra Bonita, you'll be glad you did.
0	P8fFcd7vqMwRqRt7BaJRQ	I have been coming to Oggi's for awhile now and I have always had great experiences!  There are never a lot of people there and the food is served up quick.  They make their own beer and have a decent IPA which is very HOPPY.  They also have HOP JUICE!   If you're on a budget, just ask for a "sample" of the hopjuice and they will give you one.  Whalla!  You just got a SHOT OF 14% beer for FREE.  Haha!  Anyway, the WINGS ARE THE BEST.  I get the killer wings and request them GRILLED.  I also love their pizza titled SLAM DUNK which is made with the WING SAUCE!!
0	tPKpradQVZom4a4bg6rvg	Ive been going to Grand China for about 4 or 5 years now. Not once have I had a bad experience. When I do eat inside the restaurant, Ive always had quick friendly service. Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7. They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice. Definitely worth it. The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras. No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials. The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit.
0	p8gKUFTY2izCRn57juJOqQ	The one nice thing I can say about the place is that the workers were pretty nice. Everything pretty much goes down hill from there.  I ordered a gyro and I learned my lesson to never order a gyro from a place that doesn't specialize in it. (my bad)  My friend who I was with is vegan. He ordered a slice of vegan pizza. The problem was it smelled like real cheese. We asked some workers if they were sure that it was vegan and they couldn't give a straight answer. Instead they gave us another slice of vegan pizza. This time it looked completely different and there was no cheese so we thought he was pretty safe.   I think the worst part of the pizza lounge is the bathrooms. Apparently, the men's  restroom is so terrible not even the male employees will use it. I didn't even feel clean after just washing my hands in the women's restroom. If it is legal to not have a restroom in your restaurant, I think they are better off just closing it down for good.   Great if you have late night munchies - terrible if you're sober.
0	ArxwUz2WPaC9y6wZ5pcFQ	I found the staff really friendly, and the clientele too! It's a pretty long menu with reasonable prices. Great salsa; can't tell if they make their own chips though.. back in Queens you could tell by how greasy the chips where.  The decor is just this side of Salvation Army, which just adds to the charm for me. St. Patrick's Day was coming up and they had green decorations hanging from the ceiling, which was also amusing given the sombreros on the walls and the overall redness of the furnishings.  Try the albondingas soup. It's a spicy beef broth with two meatballs.
0	AzvrZkZ3y2JMoU1LISUkSQ	Although I was sick with a sinus infection... and what I mostly tasted was "cold" ...   From my previous visits to Tropical Smoothie, its sweet and delicious and oh-so refreshing on a "normal" Vegas day.   Will definitely come back since this place is more abundant than Jamba Juice or any other places of the sort around my neighborhood
0	i84tdSwNcQZbz1Xg7nl83Q	Been here twice, polar opposite experiences. First time I was brand new to veganism, had many questions about their menu. Decided on the blt with vegan bacon, asked the girl at cash about what the ingredients were. Made it very clear that I have a serious coconut allergy, was told there was only coconut in some of their drinks. You can see where this is going...two bites in and I was starting to feel awful and realized it was coconut. Girl behind the counter was almost defensive when I told her what had happened. Said I should know more about vegan ingredients if I was a "real" vegan. Amazing.   Spent three days at home with hives and a swollen face. Was not impressed and vowed not to go back.  Second time, friend begged me to go as he was craving something on their menu. Begrudgingly came with. Ordered nothing but a drink. Different girl behind cash, asked me why I wasn't eating and I explained my prior experience. She was overly apologetic even though it was a year earlier when it happened. She even offered to let me sample something else on the menu on her, she was very knowledgeable about ingredients and even the places the ingredients were from.  Super torn on this one. Almost died once, and then was given incredible service the second time.
0	CIiDrvrgxKO7W3phXIJw	The prices are very fair, the pastas are good, and the pizzas are great.  The restaurant is very small, so sometimes you feel like you are eating in your neighbor's lap.  The help is always friendly, if a little familiar.
0	2TXOBDl8PYJmCiuMmjLsAw	I tried Cook On Wok after receiving one of their promotional menus at my home.  I decided to have them deliver.  The food arrived after a decent wait.  We had pork fried rice, pepper steak with steamed rice, cream cheese won tons, and barbecued pork strips.  We thoroughly enjoyed the won tons, the pepper steak, and the steamed rice.  We thought the pork fried rice was absolutely delicious.  We weren't impressed with the barbecued pork strips.  Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be eating from Cook On Wok again.
0	U8GPNXx93ham9GQy0Zn59w	Sorry Sinobi. For awhile I could put up with the not-so-special sushi in lieu of the far superior offerings at Penn Ave Fish Company --the only other sushi place that I know of near my place of work downtown. But the meager, sad looking "rainbow roll" with teeny-tiny strips of nothing looks like fish bait. Never again will I fork over my money for something I could get at a convenience store. Owners: Please take the time to  read these reviews and put out quality sushi! It would be great to have more sushi options near market square. $13 bucks later and my stomach is still grumbling...
0	U6yVhxreKnQf4RxnZYbgQ	After being on our list for awhile, we finally made it out to Kashman's this week for breakfast (on a week day).  I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...  We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.    Kashman's get a solid four stars, and I'd probably go more often if it was a little more convenient for me, though I have a couple of relatives who I would consider making the drive out here for.
0	1oYFgAwSJRwnylwasuOJg	There are some days when you just have to splurge. And splurging in Vegas isn't cheap. But it's sometimes worth it. And worth it it was at SW Steakhouse. The filet mignon was exactly as I ordered. A delicious sidecar to get things going and washed down the steak with a beautiful pinot noir.  The service was impeccable. We had tickets to a 9:30pm Le Reve show and they still comfortably sat us around 8pm. We didn't feel rushed once. It was a special dinner for a special evening.
0	402p9gKMrR3uobF2GsXtcQ	Ok....so I was hungry one night and decided to order some Papa John's Pizza online.  I've done it before 100's of times....but it has been several years since the last time I ordered from PJ's online.  I ordered a large Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza.  The Pizza was delivered in a timely manner....however, after the guy left and I opened the box in the kitchen, I saw that it was only a CHEESE Pizza!  Dammit! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AoKRsxts46M2bCIqBukirg?select=t06CHUYESOoosWqYRkj7ew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AoKRsxts46M2bCIqBukirg?select=ScT-S7CASvjOnb_pO3BUdw  So disappointed!  I called them to tell them about it and they said that the order shows it was a Cheese Pizza and that they've been having a lot of problems with their new website with this type of issue.....did they offer a discount for a future order?  NO.....how about a replacement Pizza?  NO....what the hell?  I was starving, so I begrudgingly ate the Cheese Pizza....and you know, it tasted "bitter".....  Next time I will order via the phone, if I call this location again....IF.  Return Factor - 10%

But it's hard to enjoy when they literally disappear for your entire meal. I think there is one person running the whole place, including cooking. I've seen people walk on and wait for 10 minutes at the front and leave when no one comes out of the kitchen the entire time. I called ahead to get food to go. I asked for 3 dishes. When she told me it would be 45 minutes, I quickly said nevermind and that I wanted to cancel the order because I needed to pick it up sooner than that. She said - ok, we'll have it ready in 15 or 20 minutes. Fine. So I arrive. Nobody at the counter. Ring the bell. 5 minutes later, someone comes out, delivers food to the one table. Walks right past me back to the kitchen. What the heck!? So I ring the bell again. It's been 20 minutes since I called. He says it's not ready, and I pay. 45 minutes into it, my food comes out. I have to ask for extra rice because they forgot. Total bill was $33 for 3 dishes that I waited 50 minutes for. The portions are usually big -- this was 1/2 a to-go styrofoam container full. Not enough to fill a plate. I took pictures so I could show the owner when I drive past again. Absolutely insane!
0	SpAZrXU0GPqDH3Ks36Zw	The customer portion of this location is TINY. Perhaps 5 people can fit in there before it feels very cramped. A small portable swamp cooler was placed by the entrance to keep it from getting too warm in there, which was like a finger in a leaking dam.  The cashier seemed aloof and did not pay too much attention to what we were asking about in regards to our order. She would ask the cooks where pizzas with a different combination of toppings than ours was, to their confusion. Then turned right around and told us the pizza would be ready shortly.  Fortunately, our food came out correctly, which we were nervous about. It tasted as Little Ceasars pizza does. Nothing overly great, but it's an expensive meal or two.
0	AUeUfyPFIhmCdRvOOZg	Was not impressed. I am not a fan of cold cheddar cheese, took it home to heat it. I am gonna stick to the other getho fab places in the area when I crave tacos. I do prefer corn tortillas to flour tortillas.
0	qqcAABR6Z0LYMKKfCrzwg	Whoa, this place is SUPER crowded all the time!!!   The pizza is pretty good, they have some nice combinations (mushroom party).  The salads are also tasty.  And the bakery bread is delicious.  The cupcakes and other sweets in the display looked really good.   It's kind of like your normal gourmet type of sandwich shop.  It's a little on the pricey side but that's expected for where/what it is.  One drawback...it seems to be valet parking for $3.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.  I wouldn't be so pleased to pay for valet to run in for a quick sandwich.
0	fC4mK5PuXTGCDX5WgADfCg	Not really much to say other than the convenience of a Wendy's in the airport which is nice if you are in the mood for a burger and a Frosty. The only problem was airport prices! The cheapest combo if I remember correctly was $8. I got a chicken sandwich combo and a small frosty and my bill was $13. Really sad! I just don't understand the need to gouge the consumer for convenience.
0	txLqEx9uU4M3X3pkINEzRg	Wir waren vor ein paar Tagen im 5 Sterne Chinarestaurant und haben beide eine Mittagsmen\u00fc bestellt. Leider hat es uns beiden nicht geschmeckt. Auch waren die Bedienungen nicht wirklich freundlich.    Als wir letzten Sommer einmal abends dort waren, hat es uns wesentlich besser geschmeckt.
0	h0PyzfOveZfgUd1xYkuQ	I flat-out REFUSED to go to the Dane in college but now that I'm all grown up, I've changed my mind.  It can be over-crowded (and perhaps over-rated?) but they've got decent (or better) food (with diverse enough choices to please almost anyone) plus they serve Strongbow Hard Cider in addition to their many fine brews.  The garden, which I believed to be an urban myth in college, actually exists and is quite lovely.  And, it's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a "taste of Madison."  Finally - their newer location in Fitchburg has a wonderful deck and a bit older, post-college bar crowd.
0	Y2U4vrSdMCibkhKmo7QQ	Great place to sit and chill out for a few hours, especially when one has a midnight hankering to go out without imbibing liquor.  Staff is always friendly and talkative.  Comfortable seating, but can get crowded pretty quickly inside. Usually always enough patio space though. Lots of students seem to frequent it and I see familiar faces most every weekend.  The coffee & tea isn't all that fantastic however (though where is it that good in this city?).  Standard shake tea bags (loose leaf should be a standard by now) and coffee that's been sitting too long in their carafes.  However, their friendly atmosphere and eclectic music make up for this shortcoming in my opinion.
0	rbxpNE5zr8ewxd7gx3Lg	Awesome walk in place for a bite to eat.  You order up at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  The atmosphere is going for an island theme, and the waiters are very nice and helpful.  The food is really, they also have your average burger and fries, which is fine for me!  Had never tried fries with thousand island and now I love it.
0	fRzuSMCYoJlxRGPNY3iA4g	Not as terrible as you would expect~! The drinks were reasonably priced and tasty ($6ish for a decent fruity mojito). Coconut shrimp were tasty, and the skewers were great as well.. came with a good sized portion of meats and veggies. Atmosphere is nice and tropical (as one would expect).
0	yc4AGvxg5scqPaRJH0BDfw	Gyro was HUGE. Fresh onion, lettuce and tomato, bread was warm and soft. Tzatziki sauce was delicious, with just the right balance of flavors. Greek salad was very fresh, and dressing tasty. The only down side is that it is pricey ($8 for just a gyro).
0	LUSer9WqJeJfMnYbBWlA	Absolute pot head that dealt with us at the window.  He was so stoned he couldn't even figure out how to swipe my card and was laughing hysterically at himself.  While my 4 children uttered "What is the skunky smell Dad?" as his odor emanated out of the drive-thru window.  Mind you this was 10 am.  Suffice it to say, our smoothies were as advertised despite this.
0	gRggbuEewiqMCFdqKqbBzQ	I usually only go here for the breakfast buffet.  It's hit or miss at this place.  The breakfast items are your normal eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, french toast, blah blah blah.  However, what really makes this place hit or miss is the desserts.  Now, I know what you're thinking, desserts for breakfast?  That's overkill.  But, you're wrong.  So wrong in fact, that that's almost blasphemous!  At no time in life is dessert overkill, okay?  Okay!  Anyway, sometimes the desserts will be really good, sometimes you'll think to yourself that you could've got better desserts in the vending machine next to your room.  But, if you're one of the lucky people to catch them on the good day, then consider yourself blessed!
0	KFN2TL1XduRnxhd1tSN3Hg	I've been here multiple times and the customer service is consistently horrible! The people on the phone taking special orders are rude and I've showed up on several occasions after being told my pizza would be ready in 10 minutes to have to wait around another 10 cause they didn't start making it.  Incompetent is a pretty good adjective for the people who work here.
0	CJEayN0VqhuJnkDGgQyPRg	"How good is your mole man??"  I quipped to our fantastic waiter.   "I'm looking for momma's secret recipe with chocolate that doesn't taste like chocolate but crack and took forever to cook. I've been to Mexico but I want the real mexico man! No cabo san lucas!"  He humored the gringo and replied, "Our sauce has been slow cooked for over three days by my aunt Rosemaria and if you don't enjoy every last drop of sauce lovingly drizzled on your chicken your dinner's on me!"  Impressed by our waiter's gusto or his willingness to conjure the image of his dear aunt Rosemaria my friend and I ordered the chicken mole along with enchiladas. Waiting for our food we munched on freshly made chips with oniony guac and a variety of salsas. We sipped irresistible margaritas teased with salt and bursting with silver tequila.  The impeccable service delivered our dishes and we dug in. The enchiladas were drizzled with creme fraiche and had hot spices yielding complex flavors and aromas. It wasn't cheesy or beany hiding cheap ingredients but rather a masterful blend of tomatoes, tortilla, filling and spices.  True to his word, the chicken mole was worth the modest cost of our dining admission. This sh** was the chicken mole bomb! Tender chunks of meat nestled beneath a warm blanket of mole sauce on a bed of delicate rice.  Undecided for dessert we doubled down on chocolate with mini muffins on trails of dulce de leche accompanied by chocolate torte heaped on top with cinnamon-infused vanilla ice cream.  (4.5 * stars)
0	jEfARp7ze5g6HwRMJ222g	One thing I'm constantly on the search for in Chicago is a good deli...I got spoiled by them growing up in South Florida! So I was very jealous of you Phoenix yelpers after visiting Kashman's Place yesterday. Kashmans- we need you in Chicago!  Ordering your food makes Kashman's a great option for a quick and casual meal.  The menu has lots to choose from, but I went with scrambled egg whites and added in some pepper jack cheese.  This came with 2 slices of delicious toast (my lunch partner, Gabi K, tells me their bagels are pretty tasty too) and fresh fruit!  Definitely a spot I'd be frequenting often if I lived in the Phoenix area and I plan on going back during my next visit...next time I'm going to have to try their potato latkes!
0	NqL4CfMeAIgsgotLDFzQ	I hardly ever feel like I waste money when eating out, but this place is an exception. They were good but my experience today solidifies my belief that this is a glorified truck stop gone chain. Our food wa greasy, undercooked and the toast--something a five year old can do right--was burnt. I ate quietly and left because it wasn't worth the energy to complain.  Needless to say, I shan't return.
0	4RczkDD6yNy7Ljn38hQNQA	Got the vegetarian pizza.  The slice was the perfect size, and cost about 5.50$.   The pizza didn't really have much taste to it though. Couldn't really taste any of the vegetables that were on it.   Won't be returning.
0	q3c3dSHnKQuhVTy86jVjvw	This was like dining at your crazy neighbor Mr. Wilson's nuclear bomb shelter - except it's not 20 feet underground and there wasn't any toilet paper (except the piece wedged under the table) or water (bottled or from a pipe) available. If experiencing post-WW3 brunch excites you, bomb away.
0	4KNwGdSOhFWjeVSyImypw	We just moved here from Scottsdale and live very close to this place. We desperately want it to be good.  I would much rather support a local establishment than a chain.  The first couple times we visited in Sept it was awesome.  Unfortunately it has gone down hill a bit from there.  Their pizza that started out as a stand out has been lackluster and soggy the last few times we have ordered it.  I hope this is just growing pains and they can right the ship.
0	hdMz5ZiriQxZ3lpzmVog	We could not believe there was a Shanghainese restaurant in Vegas. We were just driving around and I noticed in huge Chinese writing for xiao long bao $3.95. Hubby said "let's go eat there". I'm like "right now?" He's like "yeah". It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.  We get in there and the Shanghainese owner seated us. He was pretty funny. After finding out I could speak the language, he came over and talked and talked with us.   We got the XLB since it was so cheap hoping it would be good. They also had 'ma lan tou' which is a cold appetizer (which I love). We also ordered scallion pancakes which is lil guy's favorite. Stir fried rice cake is also another favorite of our's so we got an order of that too.  I then noticed they also had salty soy bean milk which, generally is on the weekend menu of many restaurants but here, you can get it at any time.  The rice cakes was delicious, so was the ma lan tou. Lil guy loved the scallion pancakes AND the rice cakes. Hubby loved the salty soy milk. I thought the soy milk was really good.... again so surprising in Las Vegas of all places. The only thing which was not up to par to Din Tai Fung of course as the wrapper was on the thick side, but for $3.95, it was alright.  To find such good Shanghainese food is one thing in the LA area, but in Vegas? I was pretty blown away. The owner was tickled pink watching hubby eat all the traditional foods commenting on it whenever he could. Since the restaurant was empty at 4pm, he was hovering over us pretty much the entire time we were eating. So funny!
0	1qO3nabeZoGchUyQif3fNQ	I liked the place even when I thought it was a chain.  I REALLY liked it when I found out it was independently owned and operated.  I've been here lots of time - but I don't even remember much about the pizza.  It was good, and other folks liked it, but I got the lasagna the first time I went there and it was so good, it's hard to try other things.  I've strayed a bit, but I keep going back to that.    Huge portions and a fun family atmosphere - though when all the seats are full it can get a bit tight.  It's not a huge place, but big enough I thought it was a chain though it's an independent building.    Meals run $12 to $23 ish, but they also run HUGE.  And not only can you share, but if you tell them you're sharing then for a few bucks more they'll split it onto 2 plates and give you an extra dinner salad.  Definitely a bonus.    Last note - if you go when the weather is nice they have a really great outdoor seating area.  The chairs aren't special, but the sides and top are covered w/ really pretty vines.  Perfect way to eat good Italian food - al fresco.
0	Q3sKOQz7A5mb5ikB40A4kA	Great little Thai place close to Nellis AFB. Fast service and friendly wait staff delivering hot and fresh Thai dishes. Their menu is not expansive but the dishes they do offer are well prepared. Prices are reasonable. Chicken Pad Kee Mow for lunch with a water. $6.95
0	RjbyxGZjEBQHiLefs0u2gw	It's okay.  They seem to have a lot of drink specials, and they had quite an extensive food special menu for the day I was there.  I wouldn't get the ribs next time, boiled meat with alot of barbecue sauce poured over the top.  Plenty of tv's, and the waitress said they couldn't make the Mojito I had order because they didn't have fresh mint for it, much to their credit.  Must be the place to take the kids on the weekend, because despite the Chuckie Cheese across the street, most had kids in tow.
0	A14oyVtnry7MJjZRjtQpsQ	This restaurant is inside the hotel Marriott directly at the airport.  If you happen to find yourself at the airport and don't have the time to head back to the city (Montreal), this is probably and unfortunately your best choice. It has a very nice ambiance and good service. The food has elements of greatness, but fails time and time again in the execution.  Asparagus soup: Delicious. I particular like the small flakes of goat cheese they added. It added just a hint of of a very nice flavor. Onion Soup: Pretty good. Halibut: Overcooked Steak: First overcooked, and when I sent it back the next one came back undercooked. Deserts: Ok  Again, probably your best choice at the airport, but nothing to write home about. If you can, take a taxi to Montreal (foodie heaven).
0	cOAdeg1k2u5unQ0oPyPnzw	Didn't expect much here upon arrival to the strip mall it is located in but was pleasantly surprised.   Decided to go for Italian food rather than go to the trendy Tarbell's  located in the same strip mall. As opposed to other reviewers,  I simple just parked in the half empty lot in front of the place, no problems.  Valet was available but not required.  The place was empty but the reception was friendly and the service was good to excellent.  Friendly Italian waiter told me it was the slowest week of the year traditionally here.   The wine list was more than adequate but the Italian selections were pricey, I found some better deals on the US selections.   The food was also good to excellent with excellent pastas and fish available, I had the cioppino (I know cioppino and this was 4 star). Salad and vegetable sides were done very well. It is a little old school, kind of reminded me of a suburban Italian Durant's.
0	q4StiN993OzWJmGJyPQOoA	My go-to place for caffeine, pastries and occasionally the stinky-bun french toast.  Can be hard to find a seat at peak bunch times and sometimes the kitchen seems slow but but it is still the best breakfast place I have been to on the east side.  I particularly like the tarts the sell though they tend to be under-cooked.
0	Pjf8hmUKzKsj9mBYLWJc2g	This Einstein is not smart. The number of mistakes they made on my order, brother's order, and a customers order is stuff a business can only get away with in an airport concession. I ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon shmear. They didn't toast my bagel. My brother ordered a toasted bagel without cream cheese. They did not toast his bagel plus they added a bagel with cream cheese that they charged him for. When I poured my dark roast coffee another customer brought it to their attention that they gave her the wrong bagel. We were about to board a plane for Chicago and didn't sweat over the small stuff.    Obviously the Terminal B Einstein Brothers Bagels is not sweating over the small stuff such as their bagels. It leaves a poor impression on the business when they are out of sesame and poppy seed bagels at 6 in the morning. But they sweat over the big stuff: making a profit. The bagel with salmon smear and coffee that costs me $5 and a few pennies at a local Einstein Brothers Bagels costed about $6.50 here.     Two things save this location from my pending "Mad Check-ins: 1 Star places that Annoy Me" list. Although the employees need to be trained to comprehend what the customer is ordering and to learn to toast a bagel they made the wrong orders fast and with a smile. And the coffee was strong and favorable on the tadte buds. It is the same setup with all the Einstein Bagels where you serve your own coffee. And that is a good thing because if I was pouring it I know it would not be decaffeinated.      What this location has going for it is its location beyond security. Because their isn't much competition beyond the security gate,  especially at 6 a.m.; Einstein Brothers Bagels is in a position to charge more and continue to run a 2 star business. In the future I will try to leave more time so that I could have a 3 star or above breakfast experience anyplace else before a flight.
0	GPI6ZHROfPpdnaUgNO3Q	Very tasty and more unique, the pizzas are NOT Dominos or such, some are without sauce (eat as is or with olive oil), great wood fired oven.  We tried the Sofia and loved the smoked mozzarella.  Not cheap, but getting a higher quality product, we will be back.
0	xzLbg1fMG5bBOUievxNtLQ	Bon...  Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9s pendant plus de 30 minutes, avant qu'une serveuse s'occupe de nous.  Le service laissait grandement \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, surtout quand on doit demander plus de trois fois la m\u00eame chose avant de l'obtenir.  Le sourire ne semble pas \u00eatre la marque de commerce de ce restaurant. La nourriture \u00e9tait bonne (pas \u00e0 se jeter par terre) et la pr\u00e9sentation agr\u00e9able. Les quantit\u00e9s convenables quand on partage. Bref, un endroit qui gagnerait \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer son service.
0	PnaunmYxyVhKzquvk6xBIA	Staff is unfriendly here.  I pulled into the parking lot and was getting out of the car.  It was 850pm and the sign said open.  One of the staff members pushing a garbage can said we are closed, "no mo" I asked aren't you open until 9?  He said yes, but the last people are in the drive thru now and that's all.  Your sign says open, but you say closed?  I guess you're more concerned with going home for the evening then my business.  Poor representation of your company.  Plenty of substitutes.  I'll stay with Pei Wei.  For a buck or two more, the service is superior and no comparison between the two.
0	1dB6728DWAA3wAJPEx5bWA	I haven't sampled the entire menu, but for a place with pizza in the name, it's a bit lackluster. Decent bang for your buck though.  Good heavy crust, not too spongy, not too tough. Way too much cheese, not nearly enough sauce and it was too bland. Good crisp veggies though.  They also have baklava which is pretty good, but not made in house which is probably why it's pretty good.   Haven't tried the rest of the menu, doubt I will.
0	I2ZS9vrTTKres1eeqHI5A	A new Japanese tapas restaurant nearby my house...awesome! I was excited to try this place bc it's closeby in SW and I dont have to drive to China/Korea Town if I wanna grab a quick bite. Well, maybe I had my hopes up too high? or maybe I was expecting it to be similar to Ichiza? For ppl who are "used to" Ichiza, dont expect this place to deliever the types of tapas and the fun Japanese-street-style-restaurant atmosphere here.   They had many varities of tapas for sure, but many tastes similar...salt or terriyaki flavor. The portion is small...all the dishes are like the size of a palm, literally. And they are on the pricier side. The quality and freshness were there but not the usual Tapas I was used to. Guess I'll still be driving down to Spring Mtn afterall~
0	QSAfaQ1us9bDldrPNneMiQ	Prices here seem about $2 more than any other Thai place, but if the food matches up, then it can be overlooked for the most part. Wandered in for dinner about 9pm and very nice looking employee steered me towards the Singapore Noodles and I substituted chicken for BBQ Pork. This dish is an acquired taste because you have to like yellow curry for it to be effective. THe shrimp and chicken in the dish were both above average with the shrimp stealing the show. The curry flavor wasn't as strong as in some other places which is a good thing and overall the dish was a pretty good rendition of the standard with better meat. It would be better for under $10 which is what most places (especially around UNLV) should be charging. Probably worth another visit though.
0	VsUJ5yGzPvBw5aksP6XXQ	This is a dance club? LOL. Guess a place can't determine the crowd that comes in...or can it??  I'll bring extra money to play the games next time. Maybe I'm just antisocial but having a bathroom for me to pee in while strolling through downtown at night was the best part. Zing!
0	rAG0B55sJTfWpA0aIfOmQ	I am disappointed to stay that they have changed their sangria.  I had previously wrote how they had the best sangria I have ever had in my life. I had pumped all my friends and boyfriend up about getting sangria and after a month, we finally made it.   The original sangria came filled with plump black berries and was made with basil which added the perfect twist to the sweetness.   However, this has all changed. No more plump black berries. No more basil. Their excuse was that basil is out of season.  I am pretty sure that you can still get a hold of it.  I think the real reason is that the person who created the menu has since left.  My bet is that the new chef thought he could cut corners without realizing the impact it had.
0	cgDCJRkRVdDXektvAJpmQ	My son loves to go to the play place, usually the kids are nice, the parents are nice too. Employees are polite for the most part, bathrooms are clean. Sadly this area has more crime each time I come here so I just stopped going.
0	AMkuoPvGjrnFRbZT1RJg	I was looking for a place to go with a group of friends, and we spotted this place on Yelp.  Summary- Pizza so good you'll slap your momma.  We had a stuffed meat pizza, 2 pitchers of beer, and a huge appetizer for less than $60. It was epic and amazing. I actually took a picture of the pizza to show people. If you have a car and can make it about a mile off the strip, eat here.
0	Q1VDEiHuS4Q5QoOth4nGbA	Food was ok, overpriced for burgers. BUT I'm giving 2 stars because of the service staff.   Service staff at the counter was surly and unhappy. I had to repeat myself a couple of times as she stared at me blankly when I ordered.   My order for a couple of burgers, drink and pie took a long time. And I had to check my order, ask for sauce, ask for plastic utensils.   I'm on holiday, so was in a positive mood, so I thought nah, maybe it's just me. But as I was waiting for my order to be ready, I noticed her snarling at other customers as well.   I'm not asking for the best service ever, but is it too hard to just give minimal service without the surliness?
0	iF3Vg9kE5JR2JNoCN8w	Dimanche 7 avril 2013 Eggstyle est un endroit "styl\u00e9" pour d\u00e9jeuner mais le menu ne l'est pas. Les plats sont en tous points pareils \u00e0 ceux rencontr\u00e9s dans tous les autres endroits \u00e0 brunch avec, en plus, un service lent, un stationnement pratiquement impossible, c'est un endroit beaucoup trop petit pour la quantit\u00e9 de clients qui y arrivent, combin\u00e9 avec un service trop lent, c'est le chaos. Les prix sont trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ce que vous y mangez.  Sunday april 7th 2013 Eggstyle is simply a "stylish" place to eat, nothing more. The menu doesn't follow. Everything is the same as any other brunch place and more to that, slow service or really slow service, impossible parking (no accessible parking spot or very hard to find), it's too small for all the clientele it receives, combined with a slow service, it's chaos. The prices are high in comparaison to what you really get.
0	Sa5FEpOjxiIlLt9d69IQw	The atmosphere is very nice for a Sports bar, however, the food and service were not impressive.  We went on a Sunday for lunch.  The wings were good, but the rest of the food was very average.   We waited a long time for the food to come and it was not very hot when we received it.  I realize we were there at a busy time, but found our server too busy to check on our table and take care of our needs.  We even waited for our bill!  I probably will not go back.
0	6RemKby8B8UUl7gpncZ7ug	First visit. My friend wanted to go for the wine dinner advertised in the Charlotte Observer the same day. We arrived and the server did not know about the advertisement and returned to say they weren't doing it. Apparently they needed reservations?  They didn't offer any other alternative for the special.  We stayed and dinner was good but not great.  Service was fine, ambiance was nice.  For the prices the food needs to be great and an effort by a manager should have been put forth to accommodate the advertised special. I probably will not go back.
0	G1YGiXrIjFyU544MQXAQ	I just had the Montreal burger.  It was the driest beef burger I've had in a long time. Way over cooked. There was no flavor to the meat so I added ketchup and mustard.  The gravy in my poutine was tasteless. The only good thing was the cheese.  I love poutine so I was pretty disappointed.  I also noticed that the girl sitting close to me made a comment about her poutine and was given a new one.  I've had great Quebecois food in the past and this was a huge disappointment.
0	6GgWxtXlDrtW9Fk6j2OP6g	This place is the very essence of 2-stars.  The only attribute that could be awarded 3 stars would be the decor.  The plates were chipped, didn't feel clean. The food was mediocre. The service was anything but friendly.  I can think of no reason to go back, even for a cheap teriyaki bowl. I figure if the more expensive dishes are lacking, the cheap dishes will be downright frightful.  For lunch on a weekend it was nearly empty; two tables occupied in a sea of vacancy.
0	1zV0fk3regDdGZX4CkppA	We were driven to this place since it showed a lot of curb appeal as a sports bar. Yes, it is one. The walls are decked out with memorabilia and it's an awesome place to watch a hockey game for sure. The bar tender was very friendly and fast in getting us some drinks and good service.   For some reason-the place just seemed dead for a Saturday night, especially during game 7 of the western conference finals. There were two large groups in the seating area who added to the chill atmosphere, but it appeared that they were eating food that wasn't even from MVPs kitchen. There was no music playing and barely any sound coming from the TVS that played the game. it seemed that our bartender was the only one working. I can't personally vouch for the food but the service was exceptional.   We left after we finished our drinks, and saw what else crescent had to offer.

The also offer a $7.99 one topping large pizza for carry-out any time.    A good value and good food.  I will say the service can be very spotty.  If they weren't so close to home I would keep searching for better service.

I see this happening every time I come her. So why are you expecting a tip when you don't even come to take to check out your customers?!?!  I like to order the pizza by th slice. They give you large slices.

I had driven past this place a million times but was less than impressed by the strip mall so I was hesitant to try it.  I've been missing out on some seriously good pizza.  We ordered a 16" pizza with mushrooms and half sausage/half pepperoni.  We picked up rather than delivery because it is in the neighborhood and they said there would be a $3 delivery charge.  It was ready in about 20 minutes and the service was great.  After we got the pizza home, we dove in and it was fantastic.  The crust was crispy but still chewy.  The tomato sauce was flavorful with out being too spicy or sweet.  I was glad to see that they used fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  The pepperoni was more flavorful than the sausage.  We thought the sausage would be better in chunk form or thicker slices.  The thing that I especially appreciated was that the entire layer of topping didn't slide off the crust when you took a bite.  We will be back to this place again and are thrilled to have a great neighborhood pizza joint.

They do a great job here and I will definitely be back.  The coffee here rivals my usual spot copper star coffee.  The drive through is awesome... I love not having to get out of my car:).
0	E3rVcJVbDyvlhDj5COCWIA	Mon Ami Gabi is a great spot for a nice dinner.  Not quite upscale like the Eiffel Tower restaurant but still a decent place for a meal.  Most will recognize Mon Ami Gabi for being "that sidewalk cafe at Paris".  Yup, that place.  The wait can get a little long, so you may want to call ahead or put your name down and gamble for a bit.  Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long since we called ahead and were seated promptly.  The staff was very nice and filled our waters without being asked.    The hanger steak was very flavorful and cooked just as requested.  I don't know if it was the alcohol or what, but I loved the steak and it was easily one of the best steaks I've had.  I've never had "frites" before (think regular french fries but thinner and less greasy) and they complimented the steak famously.  After a couple martinis and the meal, we finished our meal by enjoying a strawberry crepe.  Not the best I've ever had, but still very tasty and enjoyable.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit Mon Ami Gabi again.
0	e15Md1FSlhnfhGqfUCbFGQ	I've been to the Greek Isles several times and have always had great service. The food is great --- not the same as being in Greece, but it's really good for a restaurant in Charlotte. Great for families, dates, anything. Make sure you save room for dessert!!!
0	cN3Tz6LhIvzBmnlKI5QF3A	The sushi is far from traditional, the food is overcomplicated and doesn't make sense.  For example, the bottles on the table say Kikkoman, but when I asked why it didn't taste right they claimed the chef buys a special and much more expensive sauce for the Kikkoman bottles.  I can attest it wasn't better and strange that they would fill branded bottles with something entirely different.  The sushi rice tasted very bland and contained some hard rice.  My impression was they need to focus on getting the basics right before they expand their menu in a creative direction.
0	q1uXO9lshcxu9La96Io7g	17.47 for three burritos that seemed more like wrapped soup than than actual Mexican food. Sloppy leaky beans and virtually flavorless red chilli. I still have the green chilli burro on the counter waiting for tomorrow morning. Hopefully by then I can eat it without changing shirts. I live close by and rarely see the place open so I stopped by when I caught the "open" sign on.......rare enough. Live and learn.....
0	VdvtUbTGJL9UZmf3Wd7sCw	I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.  Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was "forced" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not "qualify" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.  The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.  They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today.
0	J6sWidUPbkFbKWDCegPg	DQ has great food for the price point. I grew up eating DQ while living in both Texas and California. However this DQ always seems to disappoint. The food has the consistency of the other DQs I've visited. However the service here is always horrible. On my most recent trip here they gave my food to the table next to me. Previously I've encountered rude cashiers and people who I'm skeptical to allow them to get anywhere near me much less my food. If you can locate another DQ nearby I recommend avoiding this one ..or going to In N Out down the street.
0	QLRfR6K9GQAeG3tNSMofw	After a long day if travel, I dragged myself in hoping for just a decent meal. I started with the House Salad with Jalapeno Ranch. Wow, kick and flavor! This "basic" salad had candied pecans, bacon and cheeses. Emboldened, I ordered the crab cake entree. Two decent sized crab cakes had so much lump meat that crab claws were poking out from all sides. I substituted asparagus for the garlic broccoli and got a nice amount of thin savory stalks. Jasmine rice was very mediocre but everything else was so great, I let it slide.   By the way, I'm not a huge beer drinker and the fresh lemonade was sweet and light!  Service was great, too. My waiter was upbeat and attentive.   I'll be back!
0	qfFwRKETQ2dJQO2fixWfTA	I love this place! The food is good, portions are guaranteed to fill you up, prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.   Timbers also has the best spinach dip in town! Ask for it extra brown and you WILL thank me later!  My only compliant and the reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that it is really smokey inside. You definitely leave smelling like a fire place.
0	txzVkAOgbTPuE5FZcFKg	We ordered Maestro's party pack #1 for $19.95.   It comes with 2 large pizzas with 2 toppings & 2 liter soda.  I ordered 1 pepperoni/pineapple and 1 canadian bacon/pineapple.  We were told that it will take 45 minutes for delivery.  Our pizzas arrived after 1 hour and 15 minutes later.  They messed one of the pizzas.  They used regular bacon instead of canadian bacon.  The pizza was good.  I gave them 2 stars because of bad service due to late delivery and wrong ingredient.
0	slhktHXxSN6hAbODFkbatQ	I really really wanted to give this place a higher star due to the "established by firefighters" idea, but I think after it has been opened for a few weeks, the kinks that the other reviewers have mentioned should have thus been addressed and ironed out by now.     These small franchise businesses must up their game in service and quality if they want to survive in this down economy;  there is no excuses for below average customer service especially for a brand new food joint trying to BUILD business.      I purposely timed my visit to go after the dinner rush, ample time before closing time.  Before I ordered online, I had driven past the food joint and looked in to make sure that there were no lines or customers waiting, as the common complaint was the long wait time for the sandwiches to be made.     Well, despite my on-line order and the payment made online via credit card (there was no option to pay at pick up if you order online), when I arrived punctually at the designated time for pick up, the workers looked confused at the confirmation number I handed to them for pick up.  Then, they said:  do you want to pay here at the register;  um, look at the receipt, it said credit card payment made online.  Then, someone notified the kid who appeared to be the night manager was notified that the online order was "missed"  but he didn't even come out to say anything;   he just sat counting bills from the cash register.     I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Mind you, there were no customers in line ahead or behind me in the whole joint.  After 15 minutes, the sandwich was finally ready.  And the kid making the sandwich said, "oh, you want it for carryout?  Really?  But I already made it for eat in, darn" and then he wrapped the sub in paper.     Hello, are you serious?!  Then one worker said:  "sorry, we didn't check the fax machine for orders".  Ok, then, don't have On-line orders;  defeats the purpose, doesn't it?     Food:  And the sub, the "hot" Italian was supposed to be steamed and warm;  um, it was sickly lukewarm.  And tasted like the Italian COLD CUT sandwich from Subway.  Yah, it was THAT cold.  The cheese was barely visible as it obviously was so thin it evaporated away.  The only thing I liked about my  Cold-Cut-Supposedly-Hot-Italian Sub was the french bread---The ones at Subway have a weird aftertaste.       I was confused, what sub place did the others eat at????   Sorry, if I'm going to shell out 12 bucks for a sub, chips and drink, I'm going to a deli or to a Subway, where at least I can get a GIANT sub for that price.  While I love FireFighters, my support is going to go via direct donations;  Firefighters are all about quality and service.   This place doesn't do our heroes justice.    You are better off going to your local Subway for a Cheap no frills sandwich.
0	GVbjJBjUeXmuUkcqwLj1HA	I want to be nice so I'll start with the place having a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Other than that, we went on a Saturday evening and found the place practically empty (The place is HUGE!). We were there with a coupon, so we had a set menu to order from. We had the 6 oz Filet Mignon which was crispy on the edges and not medium rare, as ordered. It was closer to medium/well done and a poor cut. The Mac and Cheese, Garlic Mashed Potatoes were very bland and tasteless. The wine menu is very over priced for some of the labels (Yes, we're Wine Slobs), and when asked if they had a corkage fee, we were told it was illegal in Clark County to bring your own bottle (Not True! Again, Wine Slobs)! They also were out of a couple of items which shouldn't happen in a steakhouse with nobody there to sell out to. Not particularly impressed and will probably not return. If you try it, make sure you get a Groupon or Travelzoo coupon to lessen the sting!
0	4ivfaLjDlCfBNkqTzPlQLw	I got sick while on a work trip in Pitt. I ordered some comfort food from this place and felt much better. The latkes were ok, but I'm ukie so nothing beats the potato pancakes that my baba makes in her special lithuanian potato mashing maserating machine! They used shredded potato pieces here. Chicken noodle soup was great. I don't like those big chunks of veggies and chicken in my soup and this one had them diced up finely. Lots of noodles. Best ever - noodle kugel!! I wish I had ordered another - it was awesome! The delivery was through "wheeldeliver".
0	92pfKG8tjpAK3BzXvpAaw	This is a great place.  The food is consistently good the atmosphere is nice and the entire place is clean.  The server are pleasant, the food cost is reasonable and the monogolian beef is wonderful.  This place has the velveting down pat.  The Garlic shrimp with noodles is to die for.  They use fresh vegies and nothing is greasy.  We go there at least once every couple of weeks.  Very reasonable priced.
0	iINRI4CBZ18PrW11qpaNw	All I see is a bunch of mixed reviews for this specific location.  For me, I think this was one of the better Red Lobster's I've been to and I've been to a lot.  Most of the Red Lobsters I've been to in California always include a long wait.  I have yet to wait more than 10 minutes at a Las Vegas/Henderson Red Lobster.  Let's start with service.  Been to this specific location about 4 times.  I remember one time meeting a friend here 30 minutes before they closed.  I showed up in time, but she was running late.  She showed up 10 minutes before closing and the restaurant still managed to serve us with a smile and no attitude.  I know, that's their job, but a lot of restaurants show that they are not happy when you arrive minutes before they close.  They kept the kitchen open for us even after closing.  What I will never forget is that they continued to check on us and basically asked permission if they can shut certain parts of the kitchen down.  Now, that's good service.   -Food:  If you have not been to Red Lobster before, they offer basically what any other seafood restaurant offers.  They specialize in price because it's much cheaper to eat seafood here than any other seafood restaurant (no don't Long John Silvers).    -Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good.   -Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp  -Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.    -Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  Had steaks here come too dry.  Had some come too juicy. Then had some just right.  Not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's.   -Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small thought.   -Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!  -Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.  -Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables.   -Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder.   Overall....I think you get more than what you pay for at this restaurant.  Regarding service,  I've always had good service.  One of the reviewers mentioned poor service because they were seated after someone that came in later. I have to admit, they once or twice, have done that for me. I'm not a regular or a baller, but sometimes it can be due to how big your party is and how you talk to them. Ha ha..flirting can go a long ways sometimes.
0	n4fYwpmDkqpPDQX0KFC7w	Started working in the area and came across Heidi's by accident...  I've tried the Reuben and the Hell's Kitchen, which is an AMAZING egg salad sandwich.  Been there 4 times in the past 2 weeks.  Good stuff!!  Little disappointed on the size of the sandwiches when you get them to go.  Seems like you get more when you eat there.
0	A0DFov8p1fbWet7mqCNBHw	They have specials listed on the front of the restaurant, but ask the bartenders as well.  Each bartender charged differently for their drinks.  I had some of their pre-mixed lime margaritas on ice.  I'm not usually a margarita on ice person, but they were pretty tasty.  HUGE free basket of nachos and salsa as soon as we sat at the bar.   I saw large groups, parties, kids, the whole spectrum.
0	EWrlFUFoVqutUsDrHuszEA	Beware when using the two lane drive through. We watched at least seven cars go by on one side without any response from the speaker on our side. I had to walk inside while my wife was stuck in the drive through to get anything done about the situation. And these are the people that want to make $15 per hour?
0	NwLOZy89WefWE87dhsxrOg	Two stars is probably a bit harsh but, oh well.  The other night I told my man I was taking him out to dinner because I had a hankering for some Dionika.  We joked that we would finally decide to go there again and it would be closed or something.  Well we were right, it was closed.    But, it was 7:00 on a Friday night and we were hungry, in the mood to eat out and didn't want to go far, so my guy suggested Pierre Victoire.  I can't remember what it used to be called but apparently it used to be French tapas, and tapas were definitely what we were in the mood for.  Unfortunately in the metamorphosis to Pierre Victoire they threw out the tapas in favour of standard full sized fare.  Shortly after arriving we were seated by a couple of lovely French waitresses and were brought a very small *free* starter of polenta, which was very very nice.  We ordered proper starters of the fish soup and shrimp and vegetable tempura.  I didn't try the soup but the tempura was lovely, if a bit large for a starter (though I always think starters are too large).  For our mains my boyfriend had the fish of the day, I believe, and I had the lightly curried Salmon fish cakes.  The fish of the day came with a random cooked oyster which just seemed unnecessary and the fish cakes came with chips.  Chips?  Fish cakes and chips?  It seemed like quite a lot of potato as the fish cakes were beefed out with potato.  Don't get me wrong, it was all tasty but the fish cakes would really have gone much more nicely with a salad.  Having said that I'm sure I could have asked for a substitution and it wouldn't have been a problem.    At the end of our meals (I couldn't even finish mine) we couldn't face coffee or dessert, and settled up.  After dinner my guy asked me if I would go back.  I thought for a minute and decided that no, I wouldn't.  He agreed.  Neither of us could quite put our finger on it but I think that it was a combination of the food being fine - nothing special - and the atmosphere being ok- not great- that just left both of us thinking that there are so many other amazing restaurants in the city, why go back?
0	6DUS0KHRYujQKpcKrt4oBQ	I had high expectations but am disappointed.  Here's why:  - prices are a buck or two more than they should be - seating is really cramped inside  Pro's - the cooking IS good, so there is that - patio looks like it will be good once the temps break  Really wish I could have give better marks.   I will come back and hang in there in a month or two and see how things are.
0	gUjUTblsnOlni4zNqIZGw	Went here a couple of weeks ago on a weekend at about 3:30-4'ish.  There were a few people in there but it wasn't packed.  I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, saut\u00e9ed with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!   We finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.  All in all, I will definitely go here again, just on the Steak Picado alone.
0	TIaWYpiH2Qq9E5DQO5GW4g	We were going to Kazu but it was closed for their winter vacations and we entered into Saigon VIP to escape from the cold (-20). I was so happy when I saw Laksa on the menu. I fell in love with this authentic Malay dish in Kuala Lumpur, at a restaurant called Precious. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the one I had at Saigon VIP. The mussels weren't fresh, the squid was way too rubbery, the broth wasn't flavourful enough to my liking.   My bf had the mie goreng. It was better than my dish, but still, nothing complex.   My server came with first the mie goreng and gave it to me saying it was laksa. He had no idea what he was serving.
0	J04CAoBGaUHSWbCfwDcA	I randomly ate here maybe a year or two ago w/ friends bc we were staying across the way, and my friend had a bunch of credits for free food.  My friend got some red wine sauce linguini w/ jumbo shrimp and it was freaking delicious.  I've been craving it ever since, so this time around, we came back and both ordered the same dish.  Of course, it wasn't as good as I remembered (mainly bc the four jumbo shrimp it came with was overcooked and the pasta was slightly cold), but it was still good.  We also ordered the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was really yummy and perfect for a hangover.  Though my friend didn't get the clams again, she said they were really good the last time.  Bread wasn't that great, but we were hardly able to put a dent in our food bc the portions were pretty large so it didn't matter anyways.
0	SP3ZC5D7E5Qy8qeFd8vOxQ	So my grandmother requested we go to Ruby Tuesdays for dinner last night - not my choice, but hey if it makes her happy I'll always go along with it.   I ordered the Cajun seafood  dish (broiled tilapia with sauteed shrimp and a parm sauce). I had to look that up on the menu because I am honestly shocked that was shrimp...in fact I am almost positive that they put the wrong type of meat on it because it tasted like severely  overcooked bitter lobster...it was something I ate because I came directly from work and was really hungry...and I feel bad complaining in front of my grandmother.    I ordered the side of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes with the meal ( yea super healthy...I know). The mashed potatoes were fine but the mac n cheese was way too rich for me- not horrible but I am not much for Velveeta and it was along those lines. I actually ended up giving it to  my grandmother to take home as I knew it wasn't something id eat.  The server wasn't rude - but wasn't friendly really either...I would say quite unenthusiastic sums her up.   I added on the plus one star because the manager came over to us and offered a bogo coupon which was very nice.   I am positive I would not go here on my own accord....100% positive.

Ein Buffet mit verschiedensten angemachten Salaten (von Couscous- bis Eiersalat), Rohkost und Salatsossen, daneben ein Antipasti-Buffet (marinierter Tofu, verschiedenes Gem\u00fcse, Oliven + Kapern) verf\u00fchrt zum probieren Es gibt auch warmes Essen, S\u00fcsses und S\u00e4fte und w\u00e4hrend der Woche relativ preiswerte Mittags-Snacks, aber alles vegetarisch bzw. vegan, jedoch nicht Bio (ausser Getreide und Eier).    Das Buffet selber ist jedoch ziemlich teuer (1,69 Euro pro 100g) f\u00fcr Nicht-/Teilbio-Ware, Selbstbedienung und Kantinenatmosph\u00e4re. Diesmal zu teuer, da das Gem\u00fcse in den Salaten teilweise sehr grob und steinhart war, die Nudeln im Salat waren mehr als al dente, die Artischoken faserig und manches hatte einen fast bitteren Beigeschmack  Vielleicht ein Ausrutscher (beim letzten Besuch konnte ich nicht meckern), ich hoff's mal.
0	GsQjiT2lwsiBA8TgO1eJfQ	Security guard has something against teenage skaters.  The majority of whom were Latino and she told them at the top of her lungs "go to Taco Bell if you want" while pushing them out the door.   She let everyone know exactly what she thought of them too. Shouting, instead of talking to customers or other staff "you know skaters" hardy har har.   I know they probably did bug her at some point, but my God they are kids, they bug everyone, you just get on with it?  She was unprofessional and let everyone know it, and not to mention racist with a remark like "go to Taco Bell if you want" to a bunch of Latino teenagers.   I know MacDonald's isn't an "outstanding" place to eat. But shut up and let me get on with it without listening to you shout at a bunch of bored teenagers.   The food is what it is lol
0	ovODC52JfcTSi1TriLkd5g	Eh....what more can I say then that.  Very bland, tries to model themselves like chipotle but nothing like chipotle...not good, not good at all. We'd rather go to Taco's N More or just drive to Chandler and get Chipotle or drive to Ahwatukee for The Burrito Company.

0	Lb7899s50WvwmJU1TXvDZw	Do you love sports and trivia?  Do you have a burning love for wings?  I have just the place for you...  Buffalo Wild Wings.  And that's just what they have - wild wings.  My favorite day here is Thursday.  Thursday = 50 cent boneless wing day.  I love boneless wings.  They are tasty and not as messy as traditional wings.  The ones here are great because they are nice and crispy (see FRIED) on the outside and hot and juicy (see MEATY) on the inside.  A perfect combo to match with one of their many sauces.  They even have a page in their menu with the sauce listings and descriptions.  They also list them in a heat-o-meter style so you know just what to order to suit your spicy taste.  You + a buddy + $15 +Thursday at BWW = 4 flavors, 24+wings, celery, ranch, bleu cheese, and enough wet naps to clean up even the messiest wingstravaganza.  If you are more of a traditional style wing fan, hit up 40 cent wing Tuesdays and chow down on all of the wings you want.  They also have a karaoke night and other gimmicky feature nights, but the wings are where it's at.  They have a lot of beers to choose from, but the selection is a little lacking for a gal who likes an amber ale.  Most people would (and should) be satisfied with the selection - especially for a chain establishment.  As for the sports, it's a good place to watch.  They have several (6 maybe?) gigantic projection screens so no matter where you sit you can see your game - as long as it's something reasonably popular.  Don't be tryin' to see your exhibition game when some national contest is being decided.  They also have about 30 other TVs showing other sports and the trivia game being played.  The place is family friendly, but I find that this is the type of place where parents just let their kids run amok (see ARCADE GAMES).  Leave 'em at home please - for me?
0	oNMMNFXSOO5mMcshv7OZBw	We received a coupon to go hear during a short trip to Edinburgh. The maitre d' was vaguely rude to us and extremely rude to the waitresses. The restaurant was very busy, so we were excited to get our food, but it lacked flavor. Both of us are huge seafood fans, and we felt a little let down by our meal. During the lovely walk home, we both began to notice our noisy stomachs around the same time. Although it wasn't full-blown food poisoning, we definitely had something off from the restaurant. We're both very adventurous eaters and neither of us have weak stomachs, and from the nature of the illness it was pretty easy to tell that we'd gotten a poorly handled piece of fish or an unfresh mussel. It definitely wasn't a horrible dining experience, but I wouldn't recommend the restaurant and we won't be in any hurry to dine there again.
0	kJcBvEK4aTDaJL9Ex45w	Ich war schon \u00f6fter im Aposto, meistens aber im Sommer, weil man so toll drau\u00dfen sitzen kann in netter, gem\u00fctlicher Umgebung. Am 15.01.2010 habe ich mit mit ein paar Freunden getroffen (hatte 1 Woche vorher einen Tisch reserviert) und war leider mit dem Service sehr unzufrieden. Wir sind um 15 Uhr angekommen. Es war weder noch Mittagszeit noch bereits Kaffeezeit und es war auch nicht soviel los. Es hat 15 min. gedauert, bis eine Bedienung kam. Die Speisekarten hatten wir uns vorher selbst vom Nachbartisch besorgt. Das Essen hat genau 1 Stunde gedauert (kam auch peu \u00e1 peu). Das Essen war nett angerichtet und hat echt gut geschmeckt. Das Pizzabrot hat allerdings getrieft vor \u00d6l. Die M\u00e4dels vom Service waren hoffnungslos \u00fcberfordert. Mir hat das f\u00fcr's Erste gereicht.

I eat here often, mainly because i'm one of the cheapest people you will ever meet when comes to getting lunch, and mainly because I use their Qdoba points card which gives me a free burrito after I buy 10 or something...   I would normally rate them 3 stars because it's usually "just ok", but when you can catch them at their prime lunch time, everything just seems so freakin BOMB!!  Go Qdoba!

It's a tiny, BUSY burger joint/diner on Central Ave.  It's quick too-- they got me in and out and happily fed in good time.  I need to pick a day soon to head over there again!
0	PIInWwjbVkVsNGV9jNjuXw	Was looking for a good dog on this side of town, and happened into Chicago Bob's.   I read the few reviews and decided to try the place.   Let me begin by saying they ripped off the few good places in town, the way the menu reads, but the food is not as good as others.  The Chicago Dog was over cooked. I have been eating these dogs for over 40 years and I can tell when one sits around too long. This one just had that "overcooked" flavor to it.  I also had two sliders. They are nothing like a few of the other places in town and have a weird after taste to them. As Patrick E said, NOTHING EVEN CLOSE to white castle. Chicago Hamburger or Sweet Home Chicago is the place for Sliders.   The fries were mushy and not made correctly for Homemade Fries. The best Homemade Fries in the valley are either Chicago Hamburger Co or Johnnies on Thomas.  These fries were dark and nasty tasting.  I was surprised that none of the employees even cared to ask how we liked our food.  To sum it up; The store looks like a typical Chicago place, but the food is not even close. I think Vienna should really look at who represents their product because this is yet another disappointment in the Chicago Food Experience.
0	hNvBpPXQn7Y566vPxGkYrw	Food was fresh but took a while. I noticed a younger gentleman cleaning the floors when the tables were what needed attention, and booths were dirty! Id say management is at fault and needs to give better direction. Customer service wasn't the friendliest even from the manager herself. Wouldn't be all that excited to dine in here again.
0	xjvW2pmCgvggAmsqACYjXw	"Meh" is the correct word, indeed. We received a pretty good coupon in the mail ($10 off a $20 purchase) so decided to give this place a try. After looking at their pizza prices, I could see why they needed to send out coupons ($15 for a large cheese pizza is a bit much). But, I figured, maybe they're just that good.  The garlic knots we got were kind of hard and cold, and the sauce that came with them was pretty bland. All around, void of flavor. The pizza- eh, it was okay. We ordered The Deluxe, which seemed like it should have had a lot on it, but didn't live up to the expectations. The crust was really good, though.  I might give them another shot in the future- probably only if I get another coupon, though. But damn, that California Vacation looks good. Should have tried that instead!
0	lWV36rjGz5OUhs0NQVWw	All I have to say is........I waited 30 minutes for a 12 piece box with biscuits and 20 more minutes after I got the 12 piece for some dirty rice and fries........they didn't even offer me a free apple pie for the wait.
0	R05cO9Fy2YiXgSyh0pdo1w	I keep trying to like this place and each time this place just disappoints. On this particular occasion we went and the place was empty, which is a hard feat in itself.   The food bar was messy, and most of the items were only half available. The bowls seem to keep getting smaller.   They also don't much service oriented people around, everyone was pretty snippy and rude, though the employees were congregated at the front of the restaurant playing on their cell phones and speaking inappropriately with us within ear shot.  We went the whole meal without refills and to check up on us.  I know this is a "fast food diy" concept restaurant but for the prices and the fact that there are employees doing nothing a little attention would have done well by this place.   Meh, is the best this place gets.
0	9CUl3sp5QWQy77T7iic5g	Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.  1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2) 2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too. 3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, "We have every beer you can think of in bottle." False. Who wants to play the game, "Do you have {insert beer}" repeatedly in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them. 4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult human size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini. 5. The clam chowder is very good. 6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.  I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.
0	qdJCkDXYVDHFa7TgJE7ohw	I can't tell you how much I wanted to like this place. We've been counting down the days until it opened. So I'm deeply sad to report that I'm very much "Meh" on the place. In fact, I'm borderline "Eeek".   The service was just plain ol' bad. We were left waiting forever for most things. Water's asked for, never came, we sat and watched our margarita's at the bar ($7.50 each) a good 10 minutes before they made it too our table and my daughters order was completely wrong.  Oh and did I mention the Mexican holiday music and it's not even Halloween yet. Argh. The thing that really burns me about the lack of service is the manager (I'm making an educated guess that the man behind the bar, ringing checks but doing little else, was the manager, never helped any of the servers, who all looked in the weeds the entire time. No one asked how our meal was. We were never checked on. We were asked if we wanted another Margarita when we asked for our check. We probably would have had another 20 minutes ago. Had I left drunk, perhaps today's review would have been kinder!   As for the food, utterly forgettable. Chips, good. Salsa, so-so. (And don't expect them to come to your table for free, oh no, there's a $2.50 charge for that.) Guacamole ($4), bland (note to Cinco, there are other ingredients in guac other then avocados!) My husband had shrimp fajitas ($15.50) . Meh. I asked if they could make me a vegetarian burrito. I asked for cheese. Nope! I got onions and peppers with a couple of black beans and zero sides. It was beneath Chipotle for twice the price. It also always burns me when they charge me the same as the meat option when I didn't get anything instead. Add a little guacamole or cheese instead of the meat or charge me less. Anyhow... $12.00. My daughter went off menu and asked for a bean, rice and cheese burrito. Sounds easy? Wrong. She got a burrito loaded with onions and peppers just like mine. The second attempt? A tortilla with just black beans. What? Booo!   Although none of us enjoyed ourselves, we may wait a month or two and give Cinco one more try because they are new and so close. Maybe. Or Maybe not.
0	qimLVlLdmM2LfbWWYznnAg	I have eaten at this restaurant many, many times. They must have had an inexperienced cook on the line.   Vegetables were so overloaded with rosemary, that I felt as though I had put a rosemary branch in my mouth.   Some sauce on the potatoes tasted spoiled, as did the yogurt sauce. Luckily, I did not become ill, I would have been very disappointed about that.  My friend  had Chicken Parmesan and the pasta was so over cooked it was like a paste.   Told the waiter about the experience and his reply was "I'll tell the manager." No replacement offered, did not see the manager.   Had to ask for our waiter three different occasions, he was very, very inattentive. I have never had this experience here in the past, so we MAY come back to see if they were just having a bad day. If it's not a bad day, they'll be closed soon.
0	pzLC23rrxBRU71qiGZwjmA	This is my place of choice for pizza in Maricopa.   I really like the service, the fresh ingredients, and the deals that they constantly offer.  They know what oregano and gravy are about.  Spend a little more and get a good quality taste of Chicago style pizza...delivered to your door with a smile.  And no after - problems with your stomach!    I especially enjoy their white pizzas!
0	cyofissS0xi6Ne9uBDkb0A	We went to have brunch at egg and I this past Sunday. Fast service really good filling food. A great option to the buffets while visiting in Vegas. This will definitely be a place to go whenever we are in town. Our waitress was also really nice. Can't wait to go back to have the biscuits mmmm!
0	h6EQ7SJ20u8WzgNjKLhQ	My girlfriend and I decided to brave the freezing cold and stop by for some chicken  to warm us up. We both ordered a meal to go and began our wait at 1:07, id say about ten other people came in after us and ordered and received their meals before us. Come 1:34 we finally received our meal and had to sprint to my car so I would not get a ticket. I had thought to ask if the chicken I was eating was fresh butchered since it took so long. Anywho. I dont think ill be going back to this establishment. After the long wait. Our chicken/fries didnt even taste fresh.
0	gD6Q0ry8spdKcWf0uUff5A	Came here tonight with a couple of friends.  Atmosphere was nice and good place to watch a game.  Food wasn't very good and service was sub-par too.  Might come back to watch a game and grab a beer, but that's about it.
0	1GuXrtBeqfRLBN8twnSqHg	Food: Average  Service: Ok  Early Sunday afternoon and the server tells me the fryer is "down" because the cooks are cleaning it. Who cleans a fryer in the middle of lunch service on a Sunday? Then I over here the same server, she was the only one that seemed to be working, tell a guest that they were out a BBQ sauce...again, Sunday lunch, Smith's and Alberston's are within walking distance.   We wanted to love it..maybe if they had a busser or another set of hands to help.
0	dnVokpxIXncS0bkP0x3Bg	Meh is right.   I was here because I had people in from out of town, and well, we just happened upon it.    The prices are ridiculous, though I understand because it's in a major resort, but really, if you're going to price-gouge me at least give me decent service.   The server was less than pleasant and really looked like he was being inconvenienced by, y'know, serving people.  Thanks guy.   The food is... meh.  There was New England clam chowder, lobster stuffed mushrooms, and cajun fried shrimp.  It was on par of a Joe's Crab Shack.  Yeah... again, meh.   Would I come back? Not unless the out-of-towners desperately wanted to return.
0	AzDMtzR6B7buCDZmAIAtDw	Took Matt S. advice, I am new to Queen Creek from California. If you are coming from Queen Creek and you are heading south onto hunt highway, Chens in on the left in the same center as Frys Market, but its around the corner a bit, we had to look for it.   The food was great my wife and friend loved it. Always love a good Chinese place. The portions are huge so beware. We had three people with  a grand total of $44.00 with tax. We had plenty of left overs and quality food for about the same price as Panda Express, which I am not a huge fan of.   I ordered the orange chicken it was really good, slightly crispy on outside and the orange sauce was great.  Thank you Matt for great review I know we will be back for take out soon. I would highly recommend Chen's Chinese Restaurant.
0	WwqJuhmoDkxOUHCMGE6bYw	I absolutely love this place for the corned beef sandwiches. I think the one I order is called Zachery's Brooklyn. I add cheese and get it on white bread. Yes yes...I know, you hardcore deli people, that you're supposed to get it on rye, but I'm just not that kind of gal. Anyways...   One Las Vegas trip with the parents, I was waiting for them to come back to room from gambling for dinner. They never showed up so eventually I made my way downstairs searching for a restaurant and found myself in front of Canter's. Whenever I am famish, I can't settle for something new. I have to get something I know I like. Since I already have been to the one in Los Angeles, I was ecstatic they had one at my hotel. Then I noticed the menu was a lot smaller than the original location. I have only had the French dip. OH NO!!! After 10 minutes of reading the menu (more like staring at the menu), I decided to take a chance and eat something new in my state of hunger.   This is how my relationship with the Canter's corned beef sandwich began. When I got my order, I couldn't believe how good it was. My favorite part was the coleslaw in the sandwich-so sweet, so delicious. A few minutes later, I found myself finished. I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing by myself. IT WAS HUGE!!!   I eventually came back to this Canter's and found myself ordering another one. Supposedly food taste better when you're starving, but this sandwich is just as good as when you're just moderately hungry.   I would of gave it 5 stars, but I'll save it until they add more items from the the original location to the menu. I love the bakery in the one in Los Angeles. I can't get enough of their chocolate cheesecake.   As for now, I would recommend Canter's to anyone looking for a quick place to get a sandwich. You order your food at the cashier, pay for it and then wait at your table. It will not disappoint.   Random side note: Don't forget to ask for a side of Thousand Island Dressing. It totally adds to a corned beef sandwich. Also, the Lox and Bagel is good too. HUGE SERVING!!! Also, yummy cream cheese.
0	mBxKbg9Ejm92a94iCGSOGA	I visited Dairy Queen off of 27th Avenue and Carefree Hwy and ordered a "Brownie Sundae" I also ordered a "Peanut Buster" parfait at the drive thru.  Once at home, I opened the bag and there was only vanilla ice cream with brownies on top. I returned to the DQ and indicated that my order is incorrect, and I explained what I received and they said well this is what you ordered.  I stated it should have hot fudge.  The young person so called "apologized" then replied, "Well you have to be specific when ordering as we have a peanut sundaes, marshmallow, and so on.  I then said, "I guess I will know for next time".     Now I wonder if I ordered their promotional "Oreo Brownie Earthquake Sundae" are you telling me that it will only have Oreo cookies and brownies on the sundae?  When people are trained proper customer service you do not make the customer be wrong and pretend you are doing them a favor.  That is one way to not have a returning customer.
0	kasNRva6MdQACvVx59w	Ordered the sampler set! 1oz of sample for 5 beers cost about $5. Much cheaper than most brew pub.  There are 4 regular variety of beer + 1 seasonal brew. All the beer are good. The ales are smooth, with a hint of sweetness in the after taste.   I did not order food here except chips and salsa, so I cannot comment on the food/prices.
0	UNV8sA9I5a7ph2Ku7pjg	Alright, y'all. This place is UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT as of three days ago. That means, new menu, new food preparation, new prices.  Soggy rice (that was JUST put out), poor execution of tradition dishes, and the price. Wow. $12 for a lunch buffet with only ten poorly executed options (although I can't speak for the two meat dishes).  I try not to be super negative when writing reviews but, it seems like a good warning to those who look up where in University City to eat and see almost four stars across the board for a place that doesn't have the same menu any more.
0	ajDKsFQoUy8ZWqIRRB9aw	Clean, bright, seat-yourself dining room.   The good -- Well-done ribs. Delish hot cornbread. And cole slaw that was crisp and fresh, with a decent sweet-tangy sauce.  The bad -- Soggy bun on the pulled pork sandwich.  The ugly -- Pulled pork that tasted like soot or something got into the meat! It only happened once, but it was very unappetizing!
0	cJCoWMg0VioKkn8Np5RQ	We ordered from Verdi Restaurant tonight and had it delivered to our house, we had received a flier in our door from there a couple of days ago and we have never been here before and saw several good reviews in here about them.  We ordered the Verdi Calzone with only the meat and cheese in it and had them add sausage.  We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and one of each the cheesecake, cannoli and  the chocolate cake.  The total for the food we ordered came to $39.99 plus tip.  We were looking forward to it coming!  It got here hot and in the time span they said it would arrive.  The food was quite disappointing :(  The spaghetti had a rather plain sauce on it, and the meatballs were tasty, but not browned at all so they were actually a grey color which is not very nice to see, the noodles were quite overcooked, and we understand it was delivered but they were REALLY overcooked! The calzones crust was very bland with little flavor and it had a very bland sauce inside of it, I would not order either of these dishes again. The desserts, the chocolate cake was extremely dried out, actually to the point i could not eat it, the cheesecake was not bad, but we have had much better and the cannoli was disappointing also, the filling was gritty and heavy not light and creamy the way it should be and the cannoli shell seemed to be deep fried it had the taste of old oil and was not pleasant at all.  The best part of our meal was the bottle of wine we had with our meal, which my husband had received for his birthday earlier this month! We don't think we will be ordering from this restaurant again...
0	lIkMmxpdvFFVPwRvTY36wg	Its not the best food ever but its fast food what do you expect? They will mess up your order sometimes but its fast food what do you expect? Do you see where I'm going with this? The reason I like this Del Taco is that its great for a quick cheap meal....and they have Mr. Pibb.
0	OlxHJlROaksqQPyVzj2UA	Zink was great.  There were so much I wanted to try on the menu but did not get a chance.  I ended up ordering 2 appetizers and that was it.  I'd definitely have to go back if I get the chance.     The lobster mac & cheese appetizer is yummy.  Very creamy and the cheesiness was perfect but I didn't get too many pieces of lobster meat.  I'm not sure why they have such a big sushi menu(?) but it was ok.  I tried the Philly roll and there were way too much cream cheese in it  But instead of a small piece of smoked salmon in the roll, it was placed on top of the roll so I got a lot of salmon!  We sat at the bar and thought the service was a bit slow...
0	EoU6rC7GQKqX2RzLtDeyw	This was the second buffet we hit up on our trip and it was a great choice. The prime rib wasn't as good as the Bellagio but the crab was 5x better. We must've ate our weight in crab legs. The desert room was off the hook. The flan was the best ever. minus one star for the cold unagi (who eats it like this? eww.) and the dissapointing made to order rissotto bar. a lil too gourmet to call a buffet and a lil too buffet to gourmet. but I'd probably go back again.
0	zs666ExvwKAAxA7N2mSA	This place used to be our favorite place to go. But for months the service/food has gotten progressively worse. Not to mention the music they play on the weekends makes you want to run out the door. Sad to see a place with great food (when it opened) and a great location go down hill so fast.
0	eAGImC4QR7cgRw47f9NQ	I needed good food & alcohol so my friend took me here.  The food is great home cooked Korean food.  We had the slow cooked pork belly with oysters.  This dish is fantastic.  Definitely not for everyone because of the oysters, but if you eat just the pork belly and pickled napa cabbage you'd still be amazed how flavorful this dish is.  We also had the potato & beef rib soup.  Loved the soup! It was just the right amount of spice.  We also ordered the candied corn & cheese dish to finish off.  Man that dish is the best drunk food ever!  The service is fantastic.  It's a few blocks from UNLV so it is kind of in a ghetto area, but it's the little hole in the walls that have the best food right?  Very reasonable pricing.  Can't wait to go eat there again.
0	PmRoBNEmeZFgnIOOWGOk7A	as a BBQ lover that is fequently in this area I also was SO looking fwd to 2 BBQ places opening!! we tried css bbq first, Ive never done this pay by the pound type of ordering, where did this come from?!? THAT WAS THE 1ST THING THAT THREW ME OFF,  THE WEIRD WAY YOUR FORCED TO ORDER THE MEAT.  Im sorry I dont get impressed by an aluminum tray! when you exit the line EVERYTHING is right there: drinks, condiments, sides, garbages, girls working, it was very crowded in that little area and   A VERY BAD LAYOUT DESIGN. the food wasnt anything special, the sides werent either. there were girls working right in that area the entire time we ate, it was hard to get back to the drinks. too many flies. 1. I HATE THE DELI STYLE ORDERING or whatever its called. 2. I WONT BE BACK.
0	knaJ2W13DGvdp1FeDcpVtA	Warmest Beer in the Burgh! Ive seen the owner bring back beer at 5 and put it in the cooler and expects it to be cold for HH and it's just like drinking hot water for tea. And to add to the warm beer there is no A/C so thats where I want to be on a hot summer night. The place isn't the cleanest which is a negative for me a chef always told me look at a places bathroom that will reflect the kitchen... The bathroom looks like it gets cleaned monthly maybe weekly so hopefully the kitchen gets cleaned more often. Now the Food, it is good yet inconsistent depends on day of the week (cook cooking) to determine outcome of food. Staff is par if that. And no matter what time you to the Pub there is some sort of rift raft no matter the age or gender there is just jagoffs everywhere.
0	lksT4HdDEmRASIKRurpQ	This Subway has some, er, interesting characters that patronize this location. This could probably be chalked up to the fact that the Subway here isn't in the best area. When Thai Pepper failed me and my husband, we ended up here for a quick meal. I instantly noticed that most tables were dirty. When paying for our meal, there was a bit of a language barrier. While trying to enjoy our lunch, we were bothered by drunken fools trying to make conservation with us. I hate talkative drunk people! I highly doubt I'll be returning to this location.

0	gIzlo6U3bXOpRP6R56tzw	it's a pick-up taco stand inside a bar-about 10 person seating-with nice murals & bar decor. kinda of skanky dirty dive suprise! suprise! very spicy & super tender meat almost like pot roast. mex mix(pico) was spicy!! hamburger was like you bbq it yourself-yummy. mushrooms a little overdone & greasy. chimichanga & bean tostadas were delicous!! real good food for a bar. especially if your inebriated!! Did I forget to mentio they deliver 24/7!!! i wish they would get rid of the styrofoam container all ready-it just kills food!!
0	FIKIsw4QeYZeOpXELkkUQ	Live guacamole (YUMMMM), house margaritas are simply awesome. We really enjoy going to this place with friends and hanging out over a couple of drinks and tasty food choices on the menu.  For Vegetarians- their veg fajita,  avocado enchiladas(less cheesy) and spinach mushrooms  enchilada (more cheesey) are great among other things. Strictly vegetarians must ask for cilantro lime rice coz it does not have chicken stock and for black beans because the refried beans usually at all places including here have pork loin.  Enjoy!!
0	f1tmdp44zWj1nitWSUcA	I had the fried salt n pepper catfish and calabash shrimp, it was pretty good. I'd say average for a fried fish place. The salad bar was worthless though, lettuce was wilted and gross. However the service was absolutely awful. It is not crowded at all and we have been waiting for over ten minutes for our waitress.
0	vuQPEgld6nCPBMhI48iEHg	As a vegetarian, Port of Subs is one of the few fast food/casual dining type places I can/will eat at. I looove a veggie sub from Port of Subs.   They slice the cheese (and meat) here, it's much more appetizing than the cheese/meat you see sitting there at Subway and other sandwich shops.   The main bonuses here, other than fresh slicing, are the sourdough bread and pepperjack cheese (never know if other sandwich shops have either of those), and first and foremost the mayo/mustard mix. I always get a ton of it. The only reason I took one star off my review is that lately, the mayo/mustard mix tastes a bit different (although that may just be my taste buds??), which was, honestly, the main draw for me, so I find myself coming here less often.   I also really, really appreciate that they clean the machine before slicing the cheese for a veggie (#6) sandwich here. They say it is their policy to do so, but not every location does so...and I have learned to make sure the machine is cleaned first, after I got a sandwich with some slices of meat on it from another location. I appreciate that they do this without my having to ask (esp. since I always feel a little bit bad asking them to take the time to do so, esp. @ lunchtime, when this location gets crazy busy).   Also love the frequent customer type card, buy 12 get one free! Always makes me happy to get a free, delicious sandwich.
0	0VJjWHAB1KIh1322YPOsg	Average food court. Has a ticket booth that sells tickets for cheap prices. The food is good or whatever.  They got:  - Wendy's - Nathans Famous - Subway - Sbarro - A small crepe joint - Taco Maker - some other stuff.  I never found the Cinnmanbon they claimed they had. :'(
0	fbLJmknfWvAVw0StBdLtfQ	My mom, her friend, and I had dinner at VinciTorio's last night, and what a great dinner it was. A Pilates instructor actually suggested it to my mom and so, as a loyal Yelper, I called my boyfriend and had him check the reviews. Good prices and food? We're there.   We showed up around 7 without having called ahead to find that there was a small line of people ahead of us. The restaurant was packed with families and elderly people. A good sign. We waited and chatted with the hostess, who gave us some recommendations off the menu of her favorite items. The decor was really cute, all I can really think of to call it is busy. Lots of family photographs, fake vines and leaves, painted walls. Even the bathroom has some framed photos of someone's baby, which I found hilarious. There was also some live music, from a guitarist singing covers of sappy soft rock love songs (I'm not going to lie, yes I do know all the lyrics to "I'll Be". Judge me.)   We were seated quickly and immediately brought water. Our server's name was Josh and he came right after the buser left to ask us about drinks. None of us wanted any wine or anything and he was super polite and did not judge (appreciated), and took our calamari appetizer order while giving us time to further peruse the menu. He came back with a drink for my mom's friend and a basket of delicious bread: garlic bread on a toasted baguette, and some focaccia with tomato and basil sauce. I decided on their lasagna, my mom's friend got the seafood fettucine, and my mom ordered eggplant parmesan.   The calamari arrived and it was so frickin' good! The spicy marinara sauce was fresh and had huge chunks of tomatoes and a liberal sprinkling of dried peppers in it. The calamari was in large spiraled chunks (rather than the tiny ringed slices you usually get), with a light crispy breading. We finished it off right away with the bread; there is olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table for you to mix yourself, and we definitely partook in it with the bread. Lots of grease, I know. We were then brought salads and soup; I had a Ceaser salad that had too much parmesan on it, and they both had the Italian wedding soup, which was like an Italian albondigas: a tiny orvo looking pasta, shredded veggies, white beans, and tiny meatballs. They both loved the soup.   At this point, we're already starting to fill up, when our entrees arrived. My mom's friend's pasta came in a large bowl: jumbo shrimp, clams, and mussels on fettucine, drizzled with a light tomato broth. My mom's eggplant parmesan had penne and a vegetable mix (not canned, but sliced and steamed zucchini, summer squash, and carrots).   The eggplant parm was great; I disagree with the review below that says eggplant parmesan is supposed to be cut thick. I've never been to Italy so I can't speak to that level of authenticity, but every Italian deli that I've been to slices the eggplant thinly, breads it, and then stacks it on thick. This is because eggplant has mild toxins it, people. It's purple for a reason-you're not supposed to eat it raw, EVER, and if it's cut thick and not fully cooked to softness, that chewy eggplant texture means it still retains some toxicity.   My lasagna was deliciosu and definitely very fresh; the ricotta was fragrant with basil, and the homemade pasta was extremely tender. There was too much mozzarella at the top but I think I'm just picky; I peeled the mozzarella off the eggplant as well because that much cheese really masks the taste for me. We were all too full to even come close to finishing, so we picked and picked until just packing it up.   Appetizer, one soft drink, and 3 dinner time entrees for $60. How's that for a nice evening?   Commendations again, on the service, the food, and an overall extremely pleasant experience. The ambience is very nice, and I could see this being a lovely place for a date or to bring your family to. It makes me feel good to support a family-owned business that is so welcoming to their clientele.

The pizza here was surprisingly good. Friendly service. Overpriced for my standards, but reasonably priced for Vegas standards. I would stop by here again next time I'm at Bally's.
0	QnHxHeaVTCLv7ezSKxmA	I loved the pizza here, but thought that it was a little overpriced.  I waited over 45 minutes for pizza to be done.  I highly recommend calling in your order before hand.  Not sure if I will be back because the price was high.  However, they do have awesome customer service and great pizza
0	iQvwD4PmInRn80EKh72czg	This McDonald's has gone downhill for quite some time now.  They used to be our favorite, but about every other time we go here, something is wrong - they get our order wrong, charge us wrong, eggshells in the sausage egg mcmuffins, hand us sticky cups.  Today the guy handed me my drink and the cup was all sticky.  I didn't have wipes in my car, so the steering wheel and everything I touched was sticky until I could find a place to wash my hands.  If you overflow the drink, please clean the outside of the cup.  We're not expecting that when you go through the drive-thru, you need a bag of wipes to clean your hands due to the McDonald's person handing you sticky things.
0	ljztb6X3hL4USBe8QKoD0A	We waited for over 45 minutes to get a table for my son and I.  From that point on it got worse.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food. My son took a bite and said his mac n cheese was cold.   It was freezing cold. I sent it back. It took more than 5 mins to get a replacement back for my son. On top of that the food I ordered was not at all as good as it has been at other locations. The only reason I gave 2 stars is due to the server who did his best with the situation the kitchen created.  If I have my choice I will prob not be going back any time soon.
0	HBMPhfVzO8oPOqfcSgYBg	Had breakfast here today with my wife.  Took a couple minutes before anyone came to the counter to take our order.  She was pleasant enough when she finally arrived though.  Dinning room was clean.  Took awhile for the food to come out to the table.  Holy grease when it did arrive.  Soaked through the wrappers on our sandwiches and the cardboard on the hash brown  things.   Twas a fast food breakfast.  If one of the 3 employees that seen us at the counter had offered a "someone will be with you in a moment"  or possibly let someone know there were customers at the counter this may have been a 3.
0	rkiiWO5OYTqEl6a9D3Qxtg	If one word comes to mind when thinking about how to review the food at Naked Fish, the word is "surprise."  You're in Las Vegas, you drive 30 minutes off the strip, and you're thinking... sushi? In the desert? Come on. Wow.  Top quality, great food, well priced, good service, open late, awesome.  I always end up coming here with sushi connoisseurs who order for me, and I have yet to be disappointed. These guys are big sushi eaters and this is one of their favorite places to go. That should tell you something!  Don't miss this if you're up for an off-the-strip adventure as a tourist, and if you're local, you have no excuse for not coming here.
0	9AHugQdyQQlYqNUEgn8IRw	Taco Tuesday fish tacos is where it is at. Crispy crunchy tacos. I like the roasted chipotle salsa to go with it. Beans are for the birds. Rice is nice though. I always sub beans for the rice. Over all, a pretty decent place.
0	9PVj7D9p4RzW2mH79pPbIg	I haven't ordered from this place for awhile, but I remember liking this place due to the fact that they're one of the few places that does Sicilian-style pizza.  It was delicious!  It's huge, though, so make sure you have a couple of friends if you're going to order a Sicilian.
0	lqUFw015SQOnpATPc7mhQ	Decided to try some new pizza last night and we now wish that we had stuck with our usuals.  Ordered delivery for a cheese pizza with half sausage.  The delivery was super fast, like 25 minutes but I wasn't happy with the results.  First of all, the delivery driver didn't have any change on him so that was annoying.  Then I looked at the pizza and it looked half cooked.  I like my pizza well done and this pizza wasn't even done!  The mozz. wasn't even fully melted in some places.  The sliced sausage was yucky too, it had a rubbery texture to it.  I don't recommend this pizza, it's bunk.
0	7homDVhpO9PByhHycfJw	In the fast food world Sonic ranks right up there for four very important reasons:  Cherry Dr Pepper.  Tots.  Breakfast burritos.  Breakfast burritos with tots inside.  I'm not the biggest fan in the world of a Sonic burger.  Their chicken  sandwiches are ho-hum.  Their wraps are actually good, and if you get the grilled chicken one it's actually not too bad for you, either.  Nothing else on the menu really grabs me where it counts, ya know?  By no matter what, if I get it with a side of tots and a Cherry Dr Pepper I'm a happy girl.  Better yet, if I get one of their, frankly, pretty effing awesome breakfast burritos encapsulating not only the eggs and peppers and all that goodness but also acting as an edible treasure chest full of tots I'm over the moon!  Their soda fountain can't be beat.  I loved it as a kid and I love it now.  Although I'm pretty much firmly ensconced in the Cherry Dr Pepper camp, you can add one of TONS of flavors to any drink, not just your traditional chocolate, vanilla and cherry.  Orange, grape, watermelon, coconut, lemon, lime, strawberry - the list goes on and on.  It's still funny to see the carhops come out in their roller blades.  I know Sonic gave up it's trying-to-do-the-50s thing a while ago, but the roller blades still crack me up.
0	8OsyvBbU2tLvsjcO4oZaQ	the charm of the place is still present but the coffee.. very disappointing. it's water flavored coffee which is not what you want from a good coffee. I was here not too long ago. OK, last November-December and I don't remember the coffee to be this bad..  its still a nice place to lounge or work on whatever and there's free Wi-Fi which is good. other than that, I'd skip the coffee, seriously!
0	KoT5cZq37a9FO8CBLIOcw	Have again: the Philly sandwich was actually not bad because the bun was delicious and the meat/onions was good. Not have again: the bacon/cheese fries were marred because of the cheese, which of course is not really cheese. Service was not very good since I had to remind them that they still needed to give me the fries twice.
0	6F5vS9netV1Gm7AOqMuG7A	I have dined at Sergios many time. The food is always good. Sometimes they have large parties that come in by bus unexpectedly so there can be a challenge for the waiters.  Dessert is always good.  Eclectic place, very old Vegas. One waiter names Wes is exceptional! Two other older gentlemen are ok but prefer not to have them. They replaced two very eclectic previous waiters who were a hoot, one was a German former actor and the other a dancer and lover of old movies.  I must say I MISS the other two waiters as you really got the feel of Vegas with them!  EVERY time we eat here we say why is WES working there as he should be at a busy, upscale place.  You never know from one time to the next if there will be busloads of people or just a couple of people in the whole place.
0	XMjNdDm6deHPxzUHx4APeg	I have never been to Fatburger before and it's right outside the movie theatre I frequent, so we went early to stop for lunch.  Groupons are great!  Now I like hamburgers and fries, but my daughter LOVES them.  And Fatburger didn't disappoint either of us.  The burgers were juicy and cooked just right.  We also ordered bacon on them, and the bacon was cooked nice and crisp with thick slices, none of that see through crap you get at lots of burger joints.  Curly fries were nice and hot and fresh.  And when you have all you can drink diet coke, that's like a big fat cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae!  This place was great, a little expensive for a hamburger place, but really good nonetheless.  We will definitely stop back, especially since we walk right past it at least twice a month when we go to the movies.  Yum.
0	dVF1YRP7qYqry05jmTc2PQ	Small, cramped, and serving the same disgusting chicken that this chain always has. Unfortunately, the KFC on Indian School is also a pit, so if you're craving fried chicken in South Scottsdale the only good option you have is LoLo's.  The second star is because the employees were nice.
0	NKFcCibDiSRz3FMsqI732Q	Love this Mexican restaurant but this location never get my order the way i ask for it, as many times i tell them they don't get it right and the afternoon cashier lady not friendly at all. No more this location to bad this is the closest location to my house.
0	sRaoa7yopmfO7yWPNKkg	Oh boy here we go with the wanna be sushi specialist, these folk know nothing about how to roll.  I think the intent is good but if they don't get it together we will be counting the days until they close.  How do you run out of ingredients during lunch?  You're only open for lunch, how does that happen?  I  agree with Melissa that it's way too much rice and it just took over the roll.  I think I'll continue to roll over to 112 or Enso for my lunchtime sushi fix.
0	veuOf17xc5d6V0DD5WiXw	Alright, I'm really severe I know, but hey i'll have the decency of saying to future tourist: The Best Poutine in Town? Nah Not so sure. I know where's my best poutine ever now that i've experience the supposedly the best poutine in Montreal.  Ok it's 24h. Ok it's cool to see some weird mixt of poutine but please, have the courage to call it something else. Anyway the place is always pact, the service is typically Snack Bar but in a the Trendy Plateau Mont-Royal. So I went there for my 25th birtday, wanted to try the regular poutine thinking i'll be eating the best damn thing ever. 9.10$ for a large regular poutine ( and for the other so called poutine it goes up to 13-14$ ) . It's over expensive for a poutine. For a poutine never pay more than 8$! Anyway, I eat there and feel the regular really acid sauce, I felt i was getting some cheap caned poutine sauce. Really disapointed. The large size is too big so get a regular one and save some money!  Location : feels like a neighbourhood restaurant, jammed pack with people 24/7 and like I said, too expensive for a poutine that feel pretty OK.
0	glVKCOhRliosuJy1vTXRg	This place rocks!  Cheapest lunch in Scottsdale, AZ!  For $5.00 (including tax), you get a nice serving of rice, macaroni salad and your choice of meat with boiled cabbage (most tasty).  Nice way to avoid overeating as the serving is just right.  If you're on a low carb diet, ask for extra cabbage, no rice, no mac salad.  Meat choices are chicken, beef and pork, bbq or teriyaki.  They serve katsu chicken which is nice and crispy, lightly breaded.  There is spam musubi, manapua, gyoza, crab wonton wraps and noodle dishes.  Service is good even during the lunch hour rush.  They get the line moving fast.  Sauces on the side, choice of teriyaki or katsu, sriracha.  Give it a try...  The price is RIGHT!
0	Zfws9b1k4epx3w7FQBdlcA	I ate here last night with three friends. The concept - an upscale bourbon and wine bar/pub - is great. As is the design of the restaurant. The interior is cozy and the patio feels spacious and light.   The execution of the concept, however, was lacking. The waitstaff were clearly selected for their appearance rather than competence. It took our waiter 3 long trips back to the table and about 20 minutes to figure out which wine (on the menu) my partner ordered. (Somehow he managed to confuse rose with champagne.) Just write orders down!    The cheese plate was good. The mac and cheese was OK; not amazing. My pulled pork sandwich was good, but came on a huge tray with my side piled up in a small bowl, which made for awkward presentation. The salads were huge; several times larger than the sandwiches. The bourbon flights are definitely the highlight. I would definitely recommend trying them if you're into bourbon.  With some more training of the waitstaff, this place could be very nice. But you think they'd work that out before the restaurant opened.   I might definitely come back for a few bourbon flights with my buds, but will not try the food again for a while.
0	fWjxNipuAgQrQnNv0sw7g	The quick and easy breakfast burrito (that I'm accustomed to getting at the old location) was anything but that yesterday morning when I went here to grab 4 burritos for co-workers and I.  It should have been a sign telling me to leave when I walked in and a woman was upset because she called in her order 20 mins prior and when she arrived they had not started it yet even though she was told on the phone it would be 10-15 mins.  Considering I was ordering for more than myself (didn't want to disappoint friends when they thought they were getting La Canasta and I showed up with a breakfast jack instead), I stayed.    25+mins later my order was called out and I asked if I could have hot sauce please.  I was then told "they in there" so of course I looked and I found 2 small containers...for 4 burritos.  I'm close with my co-workers but not that close that we need to share 2 hot sauces for 4 burritos.  When I asked for me she told they charged for extra and then gave me two more (which I did not and would not have paid for).  I would give this a 1 star, but nonetheless...the food is still decent.
0	KzWvUJXwvUwKqFw5bHK0w	Stopped in for lunch and grabbed the pizza + salad + drink lunch special for $9. Nice deal.  The salad was tasty. I got the Margarita pizza (sauce, cheese, tomato, basil) and it was good. Super thin crust, charred to a good crispiness. Lots of strips of fresh basil on top, making it extra delicious. I love fresh basil ! I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, but the lunch specials are great!
0	uMD71aDrmKwCnA0tlWDfDw	Allgemein Wir wurden durch die positive Kritik bei diesem Forum auf die Pizzeria aufmerksam und entschlossen uns, diese zu besuchen. Leider waren wir abschlie\u00dfend etwas entt\u00e4uscht. Bedienung Die Bedienung wirkte teilweise etwas genervt, man hatte den Eindruck, man wirkt als Gast ''st\u00f6rend'' und das, obwohl die Pizzeria noch viele feie Pl\u00e4tze zur Verf\u00fcgung hatte. Das Essen Wir hatten zwei Mal Insalata Mista, zwei Mal eingelegte Oliven und vier mal Pizza (drei verschiedene Sorten). Die Salate waren leider mit z\u00e4hem Fertigdressing angerichtet, das sehr nach Chemie schmeckte. Von der Pizza waren wir optisch und geschmacklich alle entt\u00e4uscht. Der Teig schmeckte sehr nach ''Fertigprodukt''. Er war fad und man hatte das Gef\u00fchl, auf Pappe zu kauen. Der Belag war fettig und die Salami schmeckte, als sei sie erst kurz vor Ende des Garvorgangs auf die Pizza gelegt worden. Ich mache den hohen Fettgehalt der Salami daf\u00fcr verantwortlich. Alles in Allem - entt\u00e4uschend! Das Ambiente Die Pizzeria ist gem\u00fctlich eingerichtet und man wird mit angenehmer Musik ''berieselt'' Sauberkeit Die Gastst\u00e4tte war sauber, allerdings kann das von den Toiletten nicht behauptet werden.
0	f9gHgzjCx7VHzuf6ZnkYMA	Ordered: the dish with different meat (ribs, brisket, and pork), Mac and cheese, jalape\u00f1o bread, fried pickle.   Meat was dry, fried pickle was okay, Mac and cheese was awesome.   Service was great! Can the servers here teach a thing or two for the servers at Queen City q?
0	1sB9J3Ac2GkjLfxP1aesBw	Well I found this little place here on yelp and after reading reviews decided the fam and I just had to try it. When we got there only one table was occupied so I figured it would be quick. Wrong..we ordered a couple tacos a burrito, torta, and some chicos tacos everyone raves about. Took over 30 mins to get our food. The burrito was good the tacos soggy and bland and the sauce on the chicos tacos was more like a glorified fideo broth. And on top of that they forgot two tacos in our order and then had the nerve to get upset when I called to inform them i was coming back to get them. Overall a burrito isn't enough to keep us coming back. So disappointing!!
0	GyrxhpcfgOERC4fxGBCbxw	I had dinner here with a friend tonight... I have to say that i have been a fan of flemings for awhile...  I started with the crab cakes and the french onion soup... I liked both,,, too much filler for me on the crab cake, soup was good but how hard is french onion soup... I had a salad wedge,, it was delish and i was satisfied by it... The entree was the prime bone in rib eye, med rare.. It was very good and hit the spot, some people say you ruin the steak wit A1 but hey its my steak... I can never finish it so i usually have a nice meal later...The sides were a huge baked tater,, i couldnt finish it, it came home also, the mac and cheese was good,, for some reason i love stouffers mac and cheese... Dessert was the creme brulee,  i always get this everytime where its available,,, i really like how they do theirs...  Dinner for 2 can get well over 200 bucks so i treat this as a special occasion... I love their service and their food.. Flemings is always on my list of places to eat for a special dinner....
0	mN8TcjYTX8rR9bQkXeHbnQ	Ok how about 2.5 stars? The atmosphere is the quintessential blues vibe you'd expect. Our server Jeanelle was chipper and sweet, sloooooow, but sweet. They weren't very busy at 10 am and we just wanted a simple breakfast. We got dragged in by the guy offering "free drink tickets" with your food. I didn't have high expectations about it and I'm glad I didn't. I got Chicken & Waffles, which I've had before and it was mehh. My friends got omelette's and they didn't really LOVE them, but hey, we were hungry.  Glad to know there is a Starbucks and another coffee shop in the casino.
0	lhv3dApKdOpJZKI8hgoQ	This pizza is absolutely great!!! My husband and I stopped by on Sunday, and I found myself there again today! The sausage and pepperoni slice (or pepperoni and sausage) was a great taste and a bargain( $3.12). The dough is thin, the toppings are plentiful, and the taste will have you wanting to eat pizza for days!!!!
0	GBt9CSJ7eRiqrjXNXWwYA	Dear Waffle House,   I love you dearly.  You are like a comfy pair of shoes, or a really good boyfriend.  Your always available 24 hours a day, your always within a few miles of me, and your food is reliable comforting goodness.  I came home from work on Friday tired and very stressed out.  When I woke  up Saturday Morning, the mood was somewhat still present. I decided that I needed to treat myself to a warm hearty breakfast, and I knew I was overdue for a visit to a Waffle house.  This location is just like all the others, in regards to size and design.  It seems to be a more dated, possibly older version of some of the other waffle houses I have been in.  But, the food here is always good, reliable and tasty.  I had eggs, hash browns and raisin toast with coffee.  I cleaned my plate and left one happy camper!
0	GZuIwrW8n4xrwZveDhxJEg	Came here with my girlfriend the other night and it was a very good meal that i was surprised to see in a restaurant in this area. To start with we decided to go with a bottle of wine that while very good was hard to find many priced below $40 a bottle. We selected a blend red wine that was very good enough so that i purchased one at Fry's the following day(but for half the price). To try the most variety and keep our spending to a minimum (being college kids) we decided to go with an order of bruschetta, the special scallop app., and the bison rib-eye.  The bruschetta was the star of the meal and was a true home run. When ordered there are 5-6 different kinds they do and you pick 3 and get two pieces of each. We ordered the Caprese, Smoked Salmon and the Prosciutto. All of them came piled high with toppings and great flavor. The Caprese had some of the best tomatoes and great mozzarella. The Salmon was the slacker of the trio and that isn't a bad place to be, tons of salmon and great olive/caper topping made this a very interesting and tasty dish. The prosciutto was the best with a ton of prosciutto and a great combo of balsamic reduction and pine nuts this one is something that will keep us coming back.  Next was the Salmon Wrapped Scallop appetizer which is the only thing holding this back from a 5 star review. The salmon was good as it was the same as in the bruschetta but it's flavor over powered the scallop flavor. All that came through was the grill flavor and the salmon. The scallop however was perfectly cooked just it was hard to find it's flavor.  The main course was the bison rib-eye which we ordered medium-rare and came with some excellent Guinness mashed potatoes and well cooked and flavored spinach. The rib-eye itself was a bit tougher than i expected but i expect that is because it was a gamier meat than steak which is more of what i had in my head for the taste of bison so that was on me. The steak flavor was great and while i was full about half way through i pushed forward to clear the plate it was so good.  The meal was great and worth the $100 or so after tip we spent. We will be coming here more frequently especially for the bruschetta
0	0lGDdOvUZXJmr8oRsj5Ww	I'm being gracious here.  If you like the dirty, old fashioned "hick" hillbilly feel, then this place is 4U. Terrible, rude customer service by some young weird looking chic who is a busboy. She has 2 toned color hair. Warning:  She usually works A.M. shift.  Asked her politely for an extra set of napkin with utensils and she just stared at me without a word and walked away.  Seriously?!  This cafe seriously needs employee retraining.  If busboy gal doesn't like her job, then quit, get a REAL job, or get an education.  All waitresses and real male busboys are polite here except for skunk head busboy chic.
0	dWMqcu2j0U7NvV2Vnww	Judging by the other reviews, I was expecting this place to be pretty awesome. I have  a feeling that none of the people giving it high ratings so far have had good BBQ.   Honestly, this is probably the most overcooked BBQ I've ever had, with the exception of the brisket, which was tough and clearly undercooked. The ribs were pretty much mush. They couldn't even be picked up. The bones just slid out of the meat. That's called overcooked. Ribs should NOT fall off the bone. The pork was dry and a bit tough. I wouldn't be surprised if they were serving leftovers of that. The chicken was even drier than the pork. There wasn't enough sauce in the building to bring that back to life.   As far as the sauces go, the sweet & spicy one (whatever it's called) was pretty good. Better than most sauces you'll find elsewhere. The teriyaki was horrendous. That's a flavor that doesn't belong with BBQ in any way, shape, or form. I tried it with each of the meats and none of them went well with it.   I also wasn't impressed with the overall vibe of the place. It felt dead & the staff seemed less than enthusiastic to be there.   If you're in the area and they're open, it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good BBQ is. Otherwise, it's a no-go.
0	8oXd4cscv8xhpvhTxpuxA	Take a few extra mins out of your trip and just go down to the tacobell at 67th and Peoria. The other store is nicer, in every aspect. Plus this tacobell doesn't seem to be a testing store so it takes forever for promotional items to get it.
0	FiSJWSw2Er0JiWvxB0KmQ	I've been here twice. It's a small place across from the SouthPoint.  The cavatelli - was a bit bland for me at first. Added a lot of grated cheese and the next day the flavors had evolved into a good meal.  The ribs were very good - an entire rack - enough for 3 meals.  Staff are friendly. Sports is always on.
0	K19g4oCE45qTE5LYz90Kmw	We really wanted to love it here.  We loved the Satisfied Frog and were sad to see it go.  When we heard this was a local guy, we especially wanted to love it.    The cheese appetizer, the salsa (yum!) and the hamburgers are all pretty good.  The rest, not so much.    We invited some friends to join us for lunch and burgers and ribs.  The ribs were stuck to the bone, chewy and just not very flavorful.  Another friend had lamb and said it was OK.  The beef/veggie wrap was not bad.    The staff is very young, but they're enthusiastic and want to please.  I don't mind the misspelling on the menu - it makes it more "home-grown" somehow.  The owner came out both times we visited to talk to us about the dishes.  We just didn't have the heart to tell him they really weren't great.
0	QOZaswpYu6nmezfS4TCDg	Random Mexican food place that's pretty decent.  My Australian friend and I were in Phoenix for a night during our 2 week road trip.  This place got recommended to us by the hotel guy based on pure proximity, but also for being pretty good.  Despite some semi-shady characters chillin' out front, the place was neat and clean.  The staff was friendly.  The food was also fairly decent.  We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it.  You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid.  All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.  If I ever find myself there again, I'll grab a taco or 2...
0	Ln7MkX8kgKmTuo7gUv83Q	I've been 3 times, and I don't think the quality approaches what Mike, his wife, and his mother offered in terms of food quality.  Something major has gone wrong with each of my visits so far, 1st being the seafood in the red curry was really chewy, overcooked, and possibly over aged.  2nd being the little boat appetizer nearly chipped a tooth it was so hard.  3rd being the waaaay too sweet mussaman curry I had the 3rd time.  I really wanted to like this place because it housed Mike Thai which I thought was superb on a level with Siam Orchid, but, alas, no.  Might comeback in 6 months in hopes of something radical changing.  Not quite worthy of a 1 star as that should be reserved for places that induce rage and disgust., and Swan Thai summoned quiet, bitter disappointment.
0	E5aLTklwXWUJtkiUQdYEg	Legendary service.  Our waiter killed us with kindness.  And knowledge.  And quick refills.  I don't remember the last time I've had service this good.  The grub was above average.  A little pricey, but not unreasonable.  I think my mole hovered around 17 dollars and I'd absolutely order it again.  Very balanced.  The decor is rad.  At first, I felt like I was walking into a little mission.  Once inside, I found a very comfortable, colorful dining room.  Like Danny said, not much to talk about.  It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it's in the top 10 somewhere.
0	coSXJoad7mcmV53oA0WLg	Well nicolas  you missed out on good food cuz  a guy had a smoke before he served you.  Get over it ya baby.  Bartenders smoke all the time then get you ,a drink get over it.  This is a site for opinions but not babys.
0	0ridr4GJAjXHdeGxkgTjQ	I gotta say the Bobbie has to be one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  I absolutely love all the componets that make the sandwich.  Especially the cranberry I appreciate the fact it's not the jello like stuff you get in a can.  For me it's what makes the sandwich.  The capstrami is another good sandwich.
0	nnlSzTa860yBVazxQh9Ckg	What a lovely place!!! I went here with my family for dinner and it was so nice! With Italian cuisine, and a killer view of the airplanes landing, you won't be disapointed with this place. I don't think the food is killer, but its really good. It is expensive here, and your really paying for both the food and the view.  To make it a little more inexpenive, sit in their fantastic lounge area and order wine and appitizers. I love it that there is no casino to walk through also.
0	Ok9kFIbs5f4SNdfyegLUCQ	Well, well, well... Pizza Hut. So my bf and I went around looking for a PH buffet. We went to one in BF Egypt to no avail and asked them... of course they didnt know so we took a chance and called this little gem. SUCCESS!  5.99 Lunch buffet, YES PLEASE! I used to live in Colorado and had one right by the house; cheapest and best pizza buffet imo. Of course as soon as they bring out new pizzas the people flock to it like vultures on a dead cow. But I love that they have cinna stix. The server was Meh, but the little beaner one we had the next time was suave. I'm a beaner fyi so I could say that... lol. She was awesome, the first one asked how old my 5yr old was and said she would have to charge him full price and I was like wtf?! He ate 1 slice of pizza!! (my son hardly eats, hes a skinny mini!!) but this next one didnt ask and didnt charge! My kinda woman!  Anyway, pizza here is good... salad is ok, and the service is meh if you get the good ONE. Also, seems like they always only have 1 waitress there; so I always tip a little better... unless she tries to charge me full price for the mini!
0	a4KDIKdoIjbWEQaLCirVw	Great burritos! to be honest, everything on the menu is really good. I'm a fan of the Chorrizo burrito, it has egg and potatoes, very tasty. I use to live right around the corner from here so I had the chance to try pretty much everything on the menu. The easiest way to rate this place would be to say it is just as good or better than your Filberto's, Fredrico's and your Armando's. The prices are a bit cheaper for example a Carne Asada burrito runs $4.60. The din in portion of the restaurant is really small, I usually take out. If your in the area, stop by and give it a try.
0	EJPt6Ygebjv4dZJawGpQ	Have been here almost every time I come to Phoenix.  Love the atmosphere.  My daughter and father love the big salt water aquarium at the front door.  The service is always great.  The waitress the last time we went made our meal and spoiled my daughter.    Love the non-stop edamame, especially how it is seasoned.  I am never disappointed with the food that I order.  I am confident that no matter what I order, I will love it.  The portion size is perfect.   Although it is not ideal to bring my 11 month old, the staff were great and she loved it.

Finally, after referring someone else on Yelp to this place, I figure I had to go see for myself.  For $26.95/pp, it's all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi...with pretty much no restrictions.  Now this is what makes Hikari very special.  Other restaurants usually limit you on one order of uni, amaebi, and hamachi collar per person.  Not here.  You get to order an unlimited amount, even without rice!  Yes, without rice I say!    Since the sushi bar was full, we sat at one of those teppanyaki tables and ordered off their sushi menu.  The waitress (all the staff were young and native Japanese speakers) took our beverage orders and was ready to get started with our sushi orders.  When I inquired about the sashimi, she said I could get whatever they had as sashimi instead of nigiri.  And that's pretty much what we ended up ordering all night.  Sure, they don't have a bunch of fancy rolls to choose from, but that's not why I'm here anyway.  This is what we did get:   * Agedashi Tofu * Soft Shell Crab Appetizer * Sashimi Combination * Oysters on the Half Shell * Maguro Sashimi * Hamachi Sashimi * Super White Tuna Sashimi * Seared Albacore * White Fish Sashimi * Sake Sashimi * Saba Sashimi * Amaebi Sashimi (including the deep-fried heads) * Ikura * Uni * Ika * Salmon Skin Hand Roll (with rice and without the rice) * Miso Soup  The only really bad food choices we made were the seared albacore and the saba.  The albacore and saba weren't that fresh, a bit tough and just not good.  Avoid!   The Big F really enjoyed their salmon skin hand rolls (sans the rice), having at least four all to himself!  I really enjoyed all the uni, ikura, and oysters on the half shell myself.    Sure, they don't offer dessert as part of the AYCE as the other places do.  But I'll skip some mochi ice cream for more uni or sashimi!  Service was good for the most part.  Our waitress came by often to see if we wanted more food.  There's a lot of staff here, and they are more than willing to help.  I did have to ask for my tea to be refilled all the time, so I wish they came by with the teapot more often.  (Next time I'll just ask for a teapot of my own.)  And it didn't take long at all for our food to arrive.  We barely had any waiting time in between each order.  They do offer Teppanyaki dinners that include Japanese Onion Soup, Salad, Shrimp Appetizer, Fried Rice, and Combination Vegetables along with your entree choice.  There are a couple of kid choices too.    Gratuity of 18% will be added for parties of 4 or more.  They are even open until 2 am, last call being at 1:30 am.  And ladies seated after 11 pm, get a discount at $22.50/pp.  We'll be back for sure!
0	XE8lt3YmRPMlZl0s65Gvg	My wife is in love with Chipotle, and I am in love with Qdoba. I've tried to explain the difference to people, and I am bombarded with "They are the same this"!  My response to this obviously is, "False!"  So, my wife and I found ourselves venturing over to Middleton, and since it was around 11:30, we were hungry. She spotted this particular Chipotle, and being the great husband that I am, I agreed. A very bad life choice on my part.  I ordered a simple steak burrito. Got all the fixing's on it. Looked for some awesome hot sauce like Qdoba has....left with Tabasco Sauce....No Thank you!  My burrito lacked flavor.  The Steak Sucked! It was chewy, and fatty. Not a good cut of meat. I found myself picking up my napkin multiple times, and spitting the steak pieces out. No Queso sauce!!!!!!!!!! I repeat, No Queso!  I get the whole eat healthy thing Chipotle has going on......"would you like brown rice", but honestly...."No, I want white rice, and I want some Queso". I'm not a total fatty. If I'm paying $8/$9 for a burrito, It better be great! Also, I believe that nothing is better than Cholula hot sauce. It's the best. This is something only offered by Qdoba.  I gave this Chipotle a chance and it failed miserably. No thank you Chipotle. I'll stick with Qdoba!
0	JPWfaqv9VcuuN844wnrGA	I had heard good things about Don Pedro, so when a co-worker suggested we go there for lunch on Friday, I was excited to try it out.  However, I was not terribly impressed with the food or the service.  For one, they were extremely slow in terms of service.  Then, they messed up 2 orders at our table of 4.    I was not a fan at all of their salsa -  it had way too much onion.   The lunch special I ordered was meh. I doubt I'll be going back.
0	I2vPS3LEZk42ZhBIstKpw	I have been here twice and was completly satisfied. the first time we ate in and the second time i went we just stoped for pie.  The prices are a little high.  but the pies are wonderful.. The only complaint i would have is that i had three peices of apple pie and it cost what a whole pie would have cost and they never said anything about the fact the better deal would be to get a whole pie.  we had two peices in one box and it didnt quite look like two.  but the taste of these deserts are wonderful!
0	WMMJUzixOXiBYsw7uj4taw	I really wanted to like this place as I prefer to support local owners when I can, but it was just so-so.  My husband and I had breakfast here about a week ago.  The service was really slow. We were told to seat ourselves, and then it took a long time before anyone came to take our order.  Our server was very nice, he took our drink order, brought those, but then it took another long amount of time before we got to order our meals.  We ordered breakfast plates, I had the biscuits and gravy meal that came with eggs and a meat.  I chose the ham steak.  The food was just your standard breakfast food, it was good but not great.  However, my ham "steak" was just a thin slice of ham. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I was expecting a thick piece of ham.  The prices were okay, at $6.99 it seemed expensive for just an average meal.  My husband said the same thing.  I don't intend to return to this place.
0	Kdpf7gqxA7P0yWCUpVOdA	We met friends af the end of the mid-week lunch crowd on the 2nd level patio on a warm sunny day.  This our first visit and  had the special of the day "fish tacos" while the other couple had the fish sandwich.  The "fish tacos" are apparently not always available but we found them to be excellent.  We had great service including the manager checking periodically and bringing new drinks as opposed to re-fills.
0	uJ9flwNjFkZCfUYWGSweQ	I've been here a few times.  The food is decent and cheap as well.  I've gone here sporadically during my two years in Vegas, and the 4.99 for the large bowl of pho is a good value if you were looking for it.  Although they cut you short on the green leafy mints/leaves that come on the side.  The service here is pretty good compared to other Pho places, because they don't have that much traffic, although it is due to the location of the business.    If you are going north towards spring mountain, it is easy to access.  However if you are going south and away from spring mountain, it may be a very difficult left turn due to traffic the opposite way because there is no stop light and during heavy congestion, it may take awhile due to the lack of courtesy of Las Vegas drivers.  If you are looking for value or bang for the buck, I'd recommend this place, although if the price doesn't matter, there are other places with better food.
0	pQif5kD0EW8BXHPZnP0Yg	I moved here from Northern California 2 years ago and have really been missing Togo's  sandwiches.  I finally found one in Gilbert and got so excited, I went today and had cold roast beef.  Sadly I have to say I will not be going back.  I was very disappoint, my bread was so steal it crumbled, and the produce were not as fresh as I'm use to getting in CA.  Place was clean and the young man that helped us was great but I can't say to much for the manager that was working. He stood and just watched the guy make sandwiches while other customer waited in line.  I know he was the one to ring up the customers but he  could still have help him wait on customers.  Think I'll stay with my new favorite place the firehouse.
0	1Ziv9fBJpORG5HFwjbPsJg	Good Indian chats! I would recommend the Samosa ragda. The prices are reasonable for the food. Not so reasonable for the groceries. The ambiance isn't anything special but they have all the bare minimums to let one sit and eat.  The grocery store is part of this eatery and has a decent selection of Indian snacks and other stuff one would expect to find at an indian grocery. The only drawback is the non-availability of fresh Indian vegetables. They do have frozen vegetables though. Oh, and I almost forgot, they sell excellent Samosas that come with mint and tamarind chutneys for just a dollar apiece. The closest competitor I can think of is India Plaza, they sell the same sized Samosas that taste okay for $1.29 but don't offer the mint and tamarind chutneys.
0	PC4ELuvKIHVHNI5da7adRg	first and foremost I love Genos Tempe and Gilbert! so when I saw this open next to my dads place I was like pops we need to take you there, well this one not as good as the others  it is smaller it is in a old take out pizza joint but size shouldnt matter then i see the menu is slightly different they only have one size cheese steak which is strange to me.  The cheese steak the bread was slightly stale and this place does not compare with the meat portion that the others give you at Tempe and Gilbert you have to use a fork because of all the excess meat   whoever is in charge of this location thumbs down!
0	U3iWCVcWzSp0e3o6GjmgEQ	Don't read too much in to these 1, 2, and 3 star reviews. They're mainly complaining about the service. The employees for this restaurant is made up of mainly teenagers and young adults. The service is hit or miss which is about what you would expect. It is what it is. I give it 4 stars because you have to judge it for what it is.    Peter pipers is a pizza restaurant geared more towards kids. Do you hate going to chucky cheese? I do too. Lol. Go to Peter piper. I've been 3 times already for no occasion really and I'm going again today for my sons birthday. The pizza in my opinion is amazing. I love it. I've never really had any issues with the service. I really like this place. So if you want a good pizza then go to Peter pipers.
0	arTAOpYfygZKqopPkbJA	Wanting to be fair, I've gone back to Hillside Spot (Is that name godawful and unimaginative or what?) several times, hitting breakfast, lunch and dinner..I guess I desperately want to have something more than chains and fast food near me in Ahwatukee.  I just left there after having dinner again.  They still have lots of work to do.. and need to get some of those  fools out of their kitchen before it's too late....Let's start with breakfast two mornings ago.  Pancakes, two eggs over medium, and bacon( gots to eat the sacred pig you know) .  I do like their pancakes...even if they aren't whole grain.. The over medium eggs were fried on the bottom, fried brown.   The bacon was ice cold. Not warm, not room temperature, cold.  I called someone over and told her my over medium eggs were actually fried on the bottom and she had the nerve to tell me "well you have to fry an egg to cook it."   I mean do I look like I just fell of the turnip truck? I told her I know what over medium is and these ain't.  Then told her the bacon was cold.  Cold.  She took my plate and came back with another one in 3-4 minutes announcing she had taken someone else's order.  At least the eggs were done right and the bacon was hot.  Ok.. dinner last week was a chicken and house made pasta dish that I thought was rather good.  And worked well as leftovers too.  I like a good pasta..  Dinner tonight...their roasted half chicken is always good, tasty, but the fries that came with it had so much salt on them I thought I was Lot's wife!  I mean bitter salty..How does that happen in a good kitchen? The apple pie was a mixture of warm and cool and mostly big chunks of crust....ug....... I'm batting about .150 here with this joint....I suppose I'll keep trying and see if they ever get it right....
0	eksQirJ4Ax9v6QwbLs9zqw	I really had mixed feelings about this place. After having spent a lot of time in the Planet Hollywood, I needed some place new to eat so we ventured in here. Wait was about 25 minutes with about a quarter of the tables in the restaurant being empty? They didnt seem to be short staffed but I defer to them as to what they can handle.   We started at the bar and got a couple beers. I asked the Bartender where things might be good that night and got the upsell to come back here as they were doing something with girls and the bull...no thanks. She then referred us over to their sister bar. After she was done pimping their spots, she walked around the bar and blew a sports whistle at some guys walking by. Seriously? People trying to have a drink, eat dinner and they are blowing whistles.   Once seating the waitress was pretty quick to take our order and I got the pork ribs with a starter salad. The salad was basically a huge bowl with lettuce. I got the full stack of ribs and instantly regretted it when they arrived. The stack was HUGE. The ribs had a pretty heavy smoke flavor and were decent. I also got a side of coleslaw...it was supposed to be "hot" or something of that nature and the red on top seemed to indicate such. However when I took a bite of the slaw I wanted to spit it out on the floor. This was the point at which I wanted to ask the idiot what they were thinking when they decided that putting POP ROCKS on top of COLESLAW was a good idea? It was absolutely disgusting.   Service in general was fine...you see your waitress once maybe twice and then "other" servers come out and help you the rest of the meal. Not the best experience but they seemed to be on top of things...except a bit eager to take away plates, etc.
0	YWM2qje49tMnSwxrsX03Rw	How can you say 'no' to Chinese food after a long day at work?! I know I sure can't...and unfortunately for DragonFly I got there at the end of the night. A part of me felt guilty for going in for a sit down meal, but hey, they could have told me I needed to order take out. Instead, they were very kind and served my husband and I a delicious dinner. (By the way, we were out of there by the time they were officially closed...we're not that unkind.)  The portions are large. Each dish is approximately $9-$12 depending on what you order. We ordered pan-fried noodles with vegetables and a tofu dish. Yummy and lots of both! The server was friendly and attentive.   DragonFly is located in a convenient shopping center off of Park Rd. They stay open until 10pm...so for a late night craving it is definitely accommodating and tasty!
0	LpOnHtDArA7bcHjyzbga4Q	Why does just about everything in Ayrsley suck when compared to other locations?  Is this development built on some cursed grave site?  The Portofino's is easily the worst of any in the area, the Wild Wing has been shut down twice for serving alcohol to minors and also received some pretty bad inspections scores, and now Moe's is probably the worst of any in the area.    Every Monday is Moe Monday at all Charlotte area locations.  $5 gets you any burrito, chips, and a drink.  Last Monday, we went to Moe's in Ballantyne and were served very healthy burritos, a huge portion of chips, and made our drinks at the Coca Cola freestyle machine.  That Moe's was very busy.  Today I go to Moe's at Ayrsley and received two burritos that were skimpy on the meat and barely a handful of chips, plus no freestyle Coke machine.  I guess that explains why there was only one other customer in the place.  This isn't the first time we have have been less than satisfied at this location, and we have been to several others from north Charlotte to Rock Hilll.  If you're craving Moe's, go to a different one than Ayrsley.
0	G64uSSB75XRimpQwJGRZtA	Impeccable service... near flawless food... foie gras with lentils and black truffle was such a nice change from the norm of sweet pairings with foie... downright one of the best traditional french meals one can find in las vegas.  A bit cold atmosphere but exceptional cuisine.
0	Zojq7G7Mu6mtvAVU8pXk5A	Not sure what everybody sees in this place. Split a cheese steak and Italian beef beef with a friend and the entire meal was lacking in flavor. I was surprised at how bland and tasteless it was, I was definitely disappointed based on the yelp reviews. I think I'll stick with Lukes of Chicago.
0	uEUpua5NKErQDGzc6HhCA	We've been here three times. I had sliders twice and a steak once. The slider are ok but nothing to write home about. The big disappointment was the steak. It was cooked fine an the quality of meat was ok, but the cooking method could use work. Traditionally, a steak is seared on both aides to give it a crust and then finished to desired temperature in the oven. It tasted like this one was done in the oven the entire time so it ha no crisp crust. Just a warm mush.  The drink menu is very large and creative. However, they're very inconsistent with how drinks are made. Ive had the same drink all three times and it changes significantly each time.  This place is also a little pricey if you order anything but finger foods. A steak.   Overall, with more consistency and quality control this could be a really good place. As it stands now, we'd rather eat at another close by restaurant with a wait than be seated at this place immediately.
0	e8H7XNg12VogBuvgpBfg	A wonderful dining experience as you revolve atop the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix.    This restaurant, with its valet parking, and walking distance to most events makes for the perfect downtown dining experience.  Beside that, the food and service as great.    Here's our review, complete with video: http://www.theroamingboomers.com/?p=5211
0	m2juIqCxTM1lOvMpknchog	Stumbled across this restaurant with a friend visiting in and decided to take a chance with it and do I regret making that choice.  When we went in it looked busy and took a while for them to stay us but then we were led into the other dining area which was nearly empty (only about three or for people exited from here when we entered).   I ordered the chicken pad Thai and all three of us got a mango smoothie. When the food came my chicken in the pad Thai was tough and dry although the noodles were okay. When or drinks came they gave my friend a cup that was filled 75% compared to mine. When my friend complained they said it was because it was all that was left in the blender after pouring the previous two. Could they not have bothered to put in the effort to make a bit more so it didn't look as bad? It really wasn't that busy.... Service was bad to begin with as well and slow.   Nerve coming here again.  Overall two stars both for service and quality of food.
0	fL08NhFw8uhFPUS4BPEgJQ	After way too many days and nights on the strip I headed out with the rental car looking for a sports bar or neighborhood haunt so that I could sit and relax and not be paying $12 for a drink  or $40 for dinner. I drove down Flamingo and saw the sign that said 'smokers welcome'. I thought how Iclever is that marketing scheme? I kept driving and all I could find was Mexican and Asian restaurants and bars-and I was looking for a burger or sandwich place. I decided to head back to Zodies. The lot was empty except for 2 cars. I went in--was greeted by one customer at the bar-a gal who worked 3 jobs to make it in Vegas and the bartender, Julie. I sat at the bar, ordered a diet coke and played video poker. No food because of the smoking ban where food is served but Julie quickly told me that I could get just about anything I wanted delivered and she was willing to make the calls for me. I decided not to. This place is a dump-broken down, needing repairs but I tell you, it was an awesome experience-service, friendly people in a big city where you are invisible. I will go back!  Also won $132. :-)
0	Z8YBh7AT5qs3GcM7mbiOWw	I ordered chicken tacos with no cheese to go.  I got to my office and opened a bag of tacos smothered in cheese.  I tried to call, but this place doesn't even have a phone number.  I'm sure the food is good, there is an obvious disconnect from the cashier to the kitchen. Good take-out begins with getting the order correct.
0	nNUiL93FVGYosrwAj3wUQQ	I love the food and the ambience is amazing, but I won't be coming back, because the service is frankly horrendous. We waited a half an hour to order (with several large tables seated after us ordering before us) and when we ordered, they were out of almost half of the menu. Literally half, including the dish I most like. They need to at least double the staff and work on the level of professionalism exhibited across the board. I worked in the food service industry for many years and am quite forgiving of the fact that everyone has a bad night, but this experience has become the norm at this restaurant, sadly. I just can't keep going back, despite my desire to support a local restaurant that's run by very nice people.
0	ENStrrK5gsPx5wcWb6sIA	This is the sister restaurant of Mastro's Steakhouses.  This is a seafood restaurant, however they serve the same cuts as the steakhouses.  The service was impeccable, the food was also great.  Went here while on a business trip, so I didn't spend any of my money on it.  This place is expensive though.  The bill ended up being around one hundred and thirty bucks per person.  We were drinking though, so that probably added 20-30 per person.    This is the kind of place where the waiter who serves you is 50 years old and has probably been waitering his whole life - and it shows.  Service was really great.  This is also the kind of place where there is a guy in the bathroom handing you towels.  Not a huge fan of that, but thought I should mention it.  Their bar is huge and stacked with anything you can imagine.  They also have a big screen TV in the bar.  I recommend it but it is a very expensive place (like all Mastro's Steakhouses).
0	pYG3Rxxo2dTXQHW2fIBQkg	I have driven by  Carluccio's many times over the past 20 yrs and always wanted to try it but never got around to it. It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like. Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccio's, he said it was very good. Works for me. Really cool decor, very nice and attentive staff. I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly. I think the crutons may have been homemade. Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great. The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants. Had to take half home and eat the next day. When you walk into the door, the smell of garlic hits you, which is a good sign! I thought it was priced right, $9 and up. I will be back!
0	YEpyiUpjYY3KBGb2EwtNA	Expected more from the likes of  Frank Scibelli. I am a rabid fan of his other establishments but Paco's just fell flat for me.   Chips and Salsa = forgettable The margaritas were strong, but the food was just like that appetizer - forgettable.   Worth giving them a few weeks and checking it out again, but the location was odd and along with a pretty uninspiring meal, I won't be rushing back.
0	8B755mZ2LatBKBtIYxuSvQ	If it's your fist visit, try a combo platter. Such as the beef brisket, sliced pork and St. Louis ribs. The brisket is especially tender, juicy and flavorful. The ribs are also very good.   The sides at Bobby Q are also good-sized and tasty. The beans and mac 'n cheese are especially good.   One final note: after you pay your bill, you're presented with a "Thank-Q" brown bag with fresh-baked cake donuts. Nice touch!
0	ZqwnBUAS8WJY98wwLHH1ug	Want to do something midweek and not sure where to go?  If you like a sports bar atmosphere and like to play trivia then this is a great place to go on a Wednesday night.    I'm scoring the place based on the staff and the new happy hour menu.   Recently, a group of friends ,my husband and I went there for some Wednesday night trivia.  We always have a great time and the happy hour menu did not disappoint us.  If the place is really crowded you may have to wait a little bit for your food and drinks, but it's worth it.   For those that like ice tea I recommend theirs.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  Between 6:30 and 7pm trivia starts and is a lot of fun and you can win gift certificates towards your next meal/visit.   The place isn't as noisy as it is at other places and it is nice to be able to conspire with your friends when playing trivia.
0	UPK34teo0u13BS5qqsMXwg	awesome place to eat. I come here regularly on my lunch break in the service is always friendly I recommend asking them to 'mix it up' for you once your burro is done they mix it all up before wrapping it :)
0	N1gg1NK4KZTYpHWwL1XuDg	Stopped in Vegas on our way home to San Diego but didn't want to deal with a casino. Jason's was a perfect choice! 5 min off the freeway. Huge sandwiches, fresh, natural foods, yummy soups, salad bar and a free soft serve cone for everyone!  I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Jason's is an exception.
0	dvOwkXrY9r4Ox1rWZ6jFw	I feel like a dork for reviewing a Subway. I hate chain restaurants, and I hate fast food, so why am I doing this??   I feel like a super star whenever I walk into this store. It's always "HI, welcome to Subway!" The young men who work here always use "ma'am, " and "sir" which I think is so old school, but they really are always so respectful. I've started to keep my stunna shades on in the store since I get the rock star treatment anyway.
0	WpyXlCGgheH2COwkGKXNQ	Square pizza on a cracker, I would have expected this novelty not last as long as it did, but it's still around. Quite a few have closed in the last two decades but the survivors have been some what revamped.  I remember when first open, it was a new and fresh experience.  Pizza was tasty but you did feel like ordering a second or third one as one individual portion felt like the focaccia appetizers you would get at some good Italian restaurants.  Ok, so nothing good to say on the portions, but wanting more was due to the fact it was tasty and good.  It's probably been over 10 years since I've had one but when Enoteca Mozza and Bottega were filled to the brim last night, it was a very reluctant choice over what are two great places to eat some pie.  Should have gone with my instincts and tried harder convince my better half to drop her pizza craving.  Pizza was bland and skimpy.  The charm of a crispy cracker as the base was quickly over as it was now just soft compressed piece of wonder bread.  What used to be the deal maker for them, the olive oil infused with chili peppers to pour all over your dish, was colored canola oil.  Here is a tip for them;  When the oil runs out in the serving vessel, don't top it up with more oil, dried chili peppers can only stretch out so much and will reach a point where there is no more heat to infuse the oil.  Oh well.... guess bad food is the price you pay to get a table outside on the terrace on a beautiful Friday night. Nothing worse than settling for mere convenience.  Maybe in 10 years I'll give it another shot.
0	HniSBtkgqflbSYzOuzdUA	Maybe I'm a big kid but I love this place. Not because of the bathrooms or the big freaking beers but I do love the arcades. I love the basketball, I spend at least half my card on that. Bowling is fun too but it harder then really bowling for some odd reason. Horse racing is crazy hard but I love playing it. Football is really fun too, but sometimes its down for no reason.   I might spend $20 bucks there, they always have coupons in the LV travel magazines.   The bar downstairs is crazying during football days. I was standing for about 2 hours one time. The tables have a minimum of $15 bucks a person, but the bar is where it's at. Have fun here and try to beat my score in hoops.
0	nZ6P0lip54404zNJ3phAQ	This fantastic restaurant inside Wynn surprised us.   The room was beautiful & the staff was incredible.    We had the tasting menu which most dishes was great.  The wine pairing is one of the best I've had.   Oh, and my wife fell in love with the little chairs for woman's purses, lol
0	l8T7Xsobadnm1Cp1MxBaSg	A nice place.  Actually, a little too nice for my tastes.  I like my bars just a bit rowdy.  I often feel I'm being too loud at Montmarte.  However, they do get some great bands in here.  And the drinks are always well-crafted.
0	BH0CbashwgsCTSBWu6q0cQ	Since Basha is supposed to be a fast-food type restaurant, it was nice to see that there was a good sit-down section, like in a traditional restaurant. However, the speed of the service turned the fast-food into slow food. The waitress was nice enough, but there was only one of her, and many hungry patrons. The food is standard fare Montreal Lebanese fast food. We ordered some wine with our lunch (what can I say, I'm European!). Since we didn't want to be drunk getting back to work, we ordered the only wine which was available as a 1/2 bottle. It was terrible! All in all, there are much better restos in the area which are much better and cheaper, though often without the liquor license (try Chinatown, right close by). If you must have Lebanese food in the area, this is one of the only places to go.
0	Ig6oEWRV8Lv7Ec8SNiUROw	Pretty solid Chinese.. Just didn't like the sweet and sour chicken.. But that was because it was already in the sauce.. But the rice, perfect! Still yet to find my go to Chinese place here in Charlotte that is a good substitute for my Boston, MA Chinese, but this place is very solid. I'll be back for sure...
0	bSguQslg3Z7G7wFuS28jQg	Maybe it was the fact that my team (Wisconsin Badgers) was killing San Diego State...maybe it was the fact that Angry Ale's was pretty open & not filled with drunkies mid-Saturday afternoon....maybe it was the tasty sweet potato fries....or maybe it was my husband's low key company but I really liked Angry Ale's.   I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!  I ordered the Baby Burger w/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.  Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!
0	gWsWMEH0A0s8Xj3mixRAw	I ordered a steak burrito.  Turned out that there was hardly a scoop of steak left.  Kid behind the counter asked if that would be good enough.  No.  So they had to make more steak, because of course they didn't think anyone else at 6 o'clock would order steak, and saw no need to make more upon running low.    Also, the rice wasn't cooked all the way.  2 stars only because they were friendly.
0	REryRl9gj7myBjZJJsIrg	I have only been here for lunch, and it was great. The seafood is excellent (had the Halibut Cheeks).  One of the best restaurants downtown, nice upscale atmosphere, great location, and wonderfully unique offerings. This place is a real treat at lunchtime.  I will try to get down here for dinner in the near future...
0	u4LY2nfywyoXKnHkscIv4g	I love Delux's vegetable pannini (sp?) sandwich. Superb. The sweet potato fries that come in a little shopping cart are quite aesthetically pleasing. The parking lot sucks a lot, since it is near the Biltmore and everyone who drives at and near the Biltmore are morons. Except me, of course. They're a bit pricey but if you're a rich homosexual, that shouldn't be a problem.
0	Vxg12tnFuXUnkyrsNEw	The food is technically okay here, but it's nothing amazing.  I've ordered a few times here just because it's close to my office on the west side of campus.  I've never been impressed, nor have I been utterly disgusted.   For lunch, here's how it works:  This place is downstairs beneath the building that houses Subway and The Library bar.  The only entrance is along University, which leads you directly to a stairway and the basement.  You then enter a pretty long line and are served cafeteria-style.  First you choose if you want rice or noodles, then you choose 2 items off the buffet.  They're pretty clearly marked, which is a good thing.  After you are given your items, you pay $6.70, and either sit down at a table or take your food to go.  I tend to stick to the chicken items, as the texture of the cuts of beef they use is not the greatest  Also, vegetarians beware, as I'm pretty sure the ma po tofu has bits of meat in it.  The noodles tend to be a bit greasy too, but the rice options are okay.  They also have the deep fried Chinese mainstays of sesame chicken and the like.    If I were just grading the service aspect of the restaurant, I'd give them 0 stars.  Service isn't as important as food to me, especially when I'm taking the food to go, but every time I've been here I don't really even feel welcomed or thanked because the cashier makes no eye contact nor says a single word to me.  The first time I arrived was during a busy lunch period, and there were two women working the front line of the restaurant.  The first woman took my order by barking "noodle or rice!" and then, "2 item!", and once I chose my food the second woman took my credit card and handed it back to me with my receipt without saying a single word or making eye contact.  Today I visited and was served by the same person because it was not as busy, but yet again she made no eye contact and did not say a single word during the transaction.  I don't expect great service, but at least say thanks when I patronize your restaurant?  You'd probably get another star.
0	MalfDNZ0h8lCGsB36EE2Q	I work in the same complex, just across the way. I frequent Jade Palace at least once a week, for a delicious and economical lunch. Their lunch combinations are really great! I usually get Kung Pao, which is served with Fried Rice, an Egg Roll, and a Crab Wonton. For $8.95, I couldn't ask for anything better.   My only complaint is that I don't get the soup with the lunch combo because I always eat take out!
0	BBU2fajjHIBSL9gHAMnxA	Food is ok but ridiculously overpriced. I paid $11 for a "sancocho de gallina" during lunch hour - that is simply outrageous!! And I must agree the service is absolutely terrible. They take way too long to bring your food - they even take a very long time to bring you a menu. When my co-workers and I walked in today we basically waited a full 10 minutes to even be acknowledged (and there were only 2 other tables taken). Someone in my group had to actually get up grab some napkins and wipe our table as the 2 waitresses were simply ignoring us. Not sure what that was all about. I had not been to this restaurant in many, many months and now I remember why. NEVER going back there again. The food is simply ok (definitely NOT good enough to overlook everything else that is wrong with this place). If you want better Colombian food and GREAT service try Los Paisas (and no I have no affiliation to that restaurant - it's simply the truth)
0	0RLZOREkd7sEDQxqsqKQ	Probably deserves three stars -- because the food was A-OK - priced well, uncomplicated.  Our server was pleasant enough, although a little awkward -- perhaps this is a new career for him.  We definitely enjoyed it enough to return and enough to tell our friends about it UNTIL THE BILL CAME.  We had both ordered a well drink on the rocks.  When the bill arrived, we were charged first for the drinks ($9.00 each) and then FOR THE ROCKS ($3.60 each).  The waiter said that is because they pour more when you order it on the rocks, although he hadn't indicated that when we ordered the drink.  So, perhaps they made $7.20 more than night from us, BUT they lost sooooooooooo much more in the long run.  Disappointing!  Totally!
0	ugzo93OULZwCmBQ1ZScg	Ok, don't go here late at night and give an order through the drive-through.  They messed up our order completely and what we did get was cold.  We were in a hurry to go home or we would have returned to get our food fixed (and probably spit in).  We were not happy at all.
0	AVOJjGfzwvGjB4rAAN9g	I love PB Loco.  At one time, there was a location in The Mall of America.  Sad to say,  that the MOA location has closed.  I think you can order their PB online.  I like the White Chocolate Raspberry best.
0	TryuS1a12VdLzTydw9pGoA	I don't really like Hooters' wings, but at 25 cents a pop, I'm not going to complain too much. However, it was rather unfortunate that the Hooters girls aren't actually there the same time as the wing deal.  The wings were so greasy that my friend ended up puking back at the hotel from all the fat. But he's a wuss anyway ;)
0	R34bn9OcKdmZOtmS9euFCQ	Sorry to be the one to do this, but the rating for today is low.  I know this establishment has only been open 2 days, but there were some major downfalls in today's experience.  To start, the fish taco was awesome!  So were the side dishes. The shrimp taco was not so awesome.  In fact, I'm tempted to go get a bottle of Pepto just in case.  I'm pretty sure the shrimp was not cooked all the way through.  I would have still given them 4 stars if the service was on top of things.  They were very friendly, and we beat the lunch-crowd rush, so it was not busy at all when we arrived.  My colleague ordered his bowl and they showed up with an extra burrito.  After explaining to the waiter that he did not order that, they said they would go "take care of it", but nobody returned with a refund or credit, and by the time we left, there were 20 people in line.  That was an expensive lunch for him.  I ordered the special with 2 fish tacos and asked for an additional shrimp taco.  I got one of each.  I was fine with it because the special comes with a heaping plate of beans and rice, but the guy at the counter even repeated the order to me.  He must have been having some malfunctions with his terminal.  More positives include the nice job they did on the layout.  The previous Rockin' Baja Lobster layout was not very well thought through.  Now the bar area is completely separate from the restaurant.  Great for the lunch crowd to just pop in or to take the kids for dinner, without hearing the bar crowd or dealing with smoke.  I expect to revise this review at a later visit.  For now....work out the processes Wahoos.  I'll be back.
0	qY6uAXZUy58qwCQ0lkW6Yg	There are some serious management problems at this Qdoba. I live nearby and go here often, but only because I prefer it to the Chipotle next door and get a free drink as a college student. The line will get very long and the staff takes forever compared to Chipotle. Also, I went in once and the person at the counter said nothing the entire time and instead awkwardly pointed at things. The place is always not as clean or put together as Chipotle and I think this particular store suffers because of it. The line for Chipotle is always out the door while here it slows down so much that people leave. Please, hire at least 2 or more people for the rush times!
0	8qxdeXSbLXi91t1o3qmBw	My 4 star rating is solely for the food. My hubster and I have always been curious about this place as we live right up the street and since the little one was spending the night at the in laws, we decided to pop in. It wasn't busy but then again it was a Thursday around 6pm. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger that came with thick crinkle cut fries and I had the chicken fingers. I only ordered them because I couldn't figure out what I wanted and I didn't want to hold up the waitress any longer so I was expecting your typical dive chicken fingers...fried with a nasty after taste and thin. I was wrong! Hands down these are the best chicken fingers I have had EVER eaten in Las Vegas (Cane's comes in a close second). Juicy, thick and hand breaded and they give you a shiyet load of them! It came with home made potato chips however I am not a potato chip fan period, so my the hubster ate them and I ate his fries (which were awesome). He also had a few of my chicken fingers and after we were done eating he said "i feel like we've had fingers like that before." We figured out that the fingers here are closely similar to the fingers at Cane's, another fave place of ours! My hubster also raved about the jalapeno burger saying it was juicy and great tasting.
0	qg2vJk1rfDtS42XjUlAaAw	Average  Everything was nice, apart from the coffee. Popped in during a Sunday in the festival, quick service, and my bacon roll was fresh and came pre-sauced with TK. I got excited reading the posters about shows on at the Zoo nextdoor, but did not have time to stop.   This is a comfy place with indoor and outdoor seating, and it was quite busy. The service was nice, but the coffee however, was pretty sub standard. If you see my comment on my check in, I spoke too soon....
0	t5L3htj2MfhkUvt5g73hg	I was less than impressed - given the background of the owners and the  expertise that this team brings to the table - I was UNDERWHELMED by the food, the design (which was nothing we havent seen before and looked like an outpost of Vintner Grill ) - and the mediocre service. So disappointing that tthey cold not come up with a more interesting menu or bring something new to the table that has not been done.  It was not horrible - I was just was hoping for a lot more.
0	TX2D7e3k8NoroM7WJcWOg	Not the best experience...  I'll start off w/ the good: the service was pretty good. Not spectacular, but very solid w/ no negatives.  Now onto the bad: The food is not good. In the future, I'll get a coffee and/or a juice and some toast w/ creton (which was fine). DO NOT ORDER THEIR "CLUB SUPREME" OR THEIR "BREAKFAST SAUSAGE". The philly steak in the former is dry and cardboard-like (Update: I've been told by the resto's HQ that this item is leaving the menu soon). The latter was greasy and I did not like it's seasoning.  Update #2: The resto's HQ graciously reached out to me since this review. This is consistent w the good service experience I had. They explained the changes they'll be making to the menu soon and have convinced me to give one of their many locations another try sometime. I do appreciate this concern for customer satisfaction (I have never had this kind of response before!). Hopefully my next experience will be much improved and I can update this overall review more favourably ;-)
0	RQ4FufE6JPSNJRTwxBahLA	New owners. Strange having San Diego microbrews when there are fabulous locally-brewed microbrews in PHX.   The caramel-chipotle wings were kind of a sticky mess, heavy on the caramel but the chipotle or punch of spice was missing.  It was described as their "famous (infamous?)" caramel-chipotle sauce and I certainly can't all it anything but a mouthful of sticky sweet caramel with no zing -- and at $8 for 8, I'd expected something much better.  The other option was "tavern sauce" which is a mixture of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce -- ugh! I didn't try it but I have at other bars and its a disgusting combination.   Please, have a basic "Hot Buffalo Sauce" option, nail it and leave the other sauces as options.  A sports bar HAS to get buffalo wings down and these were anything but.   Tried the calamari which was advertised with a orange-lime something sauce (can't remember) but was nothing more than ketchup and mayonnaise. Also, it was sold as topped with cilantro, mint and basil whereas when they arrived at our table, cold, there were a couple sprinkles of tired and brown basil.  Largely a cold, tentacled disaster with Utah-style ring sauce and something formerly green sprinkled on top.  The menu looks fantastic.  Clearly it was written by a professional but the end product doesn't quite match the delicious descriptions.   My suggestions are to dumb down the menu to match the product that comes out of the kitchen or make damned sure you run quality control before you present your patrons with their food.  And San Diego microbrews in the land of Four Peaks, San Tan, Nimbus and now Fate brewery?  That's akin to serving mild Pace picante sauce out of a central Phoenix taco truck.  Please.  I want to love this place as it's in my neighborhood but you have to get your shizzle together.   Please please please.  Get the wings down, get the calamari HOT and as described in the menu and if you're going to showcase microbrews from San Diego, tell me more than "well, there's a dark, I think there is an IPA and uhh some other ones"  You take care of those things and McDowell mountain ranch will take care of your bar. Work on QC because SG 101 is too close to Four Peaks, Twin Peaks and a host of other bars to send food like that out.
0	MTx2WyeXrMYuKGCnViUkQ	There are huge matzoh balls in the soup here. However, the soup is a little on the bland side - I had to add a lot of pepper.  A slice of New York style cheesecake is ridiculously big. I started out helping someone on his dessert and thought there was no way we'd finish. Little did I know this would be the best cheesecake I'd ever tasted, so polishing it off was easy.  This is one of the cheapest good places to eat on the strip.
0	yYBRzFtNR68WVsOn6Ujrw	I went to this place after searching for egg foo young in my area. Since it is really close by and Sherry M. says the egg foo young is really good I had to try it out. Not in the greatest of neighborhoods but sometimes that's where you find really good food. I did like the fact that it said "New York Style Chinese Food" on the menu. None of the lunch specials looked that great so I ordered a small order of each: egg drop soup, bbq pork foo young, and garlic chicken. -Egg drop soup was light and flavorful. Not too thick like a lot egg drop soups. Also no corn. Light, clear broth with long strands of egg. -Pork egg foo  young could have been much better. The pork was way overcooked, to the point of being really tough and hard to chew. Should have perhaps tried chicken. 2 nice-sized patties for a small portion. Didn't like the gravy too much. My family is from New York, and I remember as child, just moving to Vegas and had the best egg foo young from Chinese restaurants that no longer exist. I remember the gravy being like gravy..very smooth and rich and patties nice and fat and full of goodies like bean sprouts. Very hard to find that richness so far from any restaurants I've tried, so will continue my quest. Anyway, I digress. The gravy at DB is more like a glaze. And it should have been served on the side for a take out order. Some of the gravy dripped out of the box. The patty was good, but the dried pork ruined it. -Garlic chicken wasn't what I expected. Lots of large chunks of vegetables: bell pepper, onion, broccoli, celery, carrot, zucchini. There were also red pepper flakes and a sweetness to the sauce. I wasn't expecting such a large amount of veggies with garlic chicken. They were good, nice and crisp, but I picked out the celery, which I don't really care for. They were just very LARGE. Couldn't really taste any garlic.  After eating this meal there was an overwhelming saltiness in my mouth. Don't know if it's from the soy sauce or from the meal itself. I might give this place another shot, have to look over menu again to see if it will be worth it.
0	UhXjsDZ21Oun3CkaoWgg	Very cool, very casual little new restaurant on Wilson street. I popped in here with a couple of friends on a terribly blustery and snowy day for November to grab some lunch and warm up. And it really did the trick. Three of us snagged a nice little bottle of red wine with some tasty little prosciutto flatbread sandwiches and a bucatini (hollow spaghetti) dish. All in all the lunch was super light and simple which was great considering all the fried food I had been stuffing my face with while in Madison. We topped it all of with some really delicious deserts, the pumpkin dish (whose name escapes me right now) was pretty unbelievable. My only complaint is that they seem to have a few growing pains to work out like offering us wine they ran out of and giving us our check too soon, but all in all a pretty cool Italian restaurant.
0	NtLDY8Ze1hETZ4ksbnxGg	Last evening was my first visit at this location. As a huge fan 5 Guys this location did not impress me. I am highly disappointed in the customer service. I walked in and was not immediately greeted. Matter of fact it was around 7pm at night and the location was super slow. Only two tables had patrons and me the walk in. There were three employees working. A mail stocking up fries, another mail cleaning the grill and a woman who was the person who rang me up stocking/cleaning the condiments. As I stood at the register she did not realize I had been there for a while because she was consumed in her work. Finally another employee noticed me and greeted me. I was asked if I had been here before and mentioned that I had and knew what I wanted. She had no smile and I had to repeat my order three times. Mind you I only ordered one veggie sandwich. She then placed her hand out not even looking at me telling me the total. Once I gave her the money she handed me my receipt and told me my number as she turned her back to walk away. As I my food was being cooked the man making the fries sneezed on his arm. Never washed his hands grabbed another tissue. What is gross he sneezed two more times repeating the same act. With no hand washing going on I prayed he would not be the person to deliver my food. Luckily it was the lady who rang me up but all she did was just handed me my bag then walked away. No thank you for my service. Either she was having a bad day or this is the service at this location which is disappointing as 5 Guys is not known for bad service.
0	luwLX2xo9N26omOrThdnyA	First time trying this place. Stopped in for a quick lunch while at a conference. They are located in the food court inside Northlake Mall. I ordered the fried rice combo with orange chicken and bourbon chicken. Got to the register to pay and they don't have ANY soy or duck sauce. Lady says they haven't received their delivery yet. I wish I'd known this prior to ordering and I believe that they deliberately don't tell customers because once you pay its too late. The orange chicken was too sweet and the bourbon chicken was just ok. There were some really dried up pieces in the mix. Probably left over from yesterday.  Really wanted some soy and duck sauce. Would have helped with the taste. I prolly won't return.
0	CtlgUR4lld51hzQbfjzbA	The Skinny: with the two signature items being only so-so, this joint is a no-go (2.5), service: counter service was efficient however the lack of accessibility of items such as ketchup at a fast food joint was annoying(2.5) value: certainly the food is better quality than other generic fast food joints however that doesn't mean that it's worth the trip (2.5).  I really wanted to love this place - fried chicken and beignets... what's there not to love?  Oh dear...  We ordered a plate of chicken tenders with fries, a chicken sandwich and a beignets - making sure to test all their signature items. Counter service was quick (we were the only customers at 1:30 pm on a weekday afternoon - food took less than 15 minutes) and the food arrived to the table piping hot. Portion sizes for most things were very reasonable given the price.  The fried chicken tenders were singularily disappointing. ($6.50) Uneven battering and cutting of the chicken rendered some parts moist while other parts very dry (check the pics). Overall, the meat was cut too thick which definitely overwhelmed what little batter there was. The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.  The chicken in the chicken sandwich fared better because the cut of the meat was a little thinner ($3.50). However, enveloped in a rather generic large bun (which wasn't a brioche bun as advertised - it's more of a sweet roll) with no sauces or accompaniments (ie, lettuce, tomato, mayo), it was like biting into the Sahara. We ended up disposing of the bun altogether which made for a much better tasting experience.  Sauces were a major issue. We were served these two chicken items plus a large serving of fries with 2 small packets of ketchup, 2 small packets of bbq sauce (some sorta generic stuff) and 1 large packet of Newman's Own Honey Mustard sauce. You had to ask the lady behind the counter for any additional ketchup which was very annoying (she gave me only 2 more small packets of ketchup... I regularly uses at least six of those bad boys for a small serving of fries).   Beignets are supposed to be lovely and crisp on the inside while light and airy on the inside. The bennies here are like a deep fried large pocket of air (almost like a pita pocket) with little to no crispness.   Despite all these issues, their standout item is definitely their g-fries. Their fries were perfectly golden and crisp on the outside with the right amount of softness on the inside. The flavouring of the garlic, parsley, salt and pepper was fantastic. If only their chicken and bennys were this good...  Overall, given the food, the hard to find location and the price point, there really isn't much to come back here for especially since there are other places that does it better.
0	wQlmB3auDOsEFakIpQ9kwA	This small restaurant caught the eye of my wife and I for breakfast.  The decor, ambience, and service were great.  The food wasn't.  We both ordered the breakfast combos (one with frencht toast, one with pancakes) with eggs, bacon, and toast.  The breakfast was comparable to a Jimmy Dean or Swanson frozen breakfast.  Sadly, this breakfast totaled around $30. Ouch.
0	crIADvaugHyaNlZGMUgzIQ	Pancake Cafe was our favorite place to eat Breakfast when they were in Sun Prairie.  We found the Fitchburg location while taking our daughter to UW-Platteville.    We ate there a few times and were never disappointed.  I have tried something from just about every area of the menu and have never been disappointed.  Now, my daughter graduated about a year ago.  We have not had the opportunity to eat there since then as we live too far away.  It is sad to see the more recent reviews.  I hope management there reads these reviews and puts Pancake Cafe back in the same place they were over a year ago.
0	KOJx3AzlWTXKWQypzwIg	Ever have a meal where you regret wasting your hunger and the excitement and anticipation of filling that hunger with something delicious like all you can eat sushi? To understand exactly what I'm talking about, order a pizza from Deli Pizza Cafe.  The pizza dough was tasteless, needed salt and had that dry taste to it. The sauce was basic, the cheese was cheap and overall I could find 10 frozen pizzas at walmart that I would prefer to this thing.  The only reason I'm adding a star is because the worker behind the counter was friendly...kind of a local guy that seemed to have lived in Vegas for like 30 some years...but definitely save your hunger bullets for elsewhere.
0	hr3hfwXVJ5eLpmDnQXg6VQ	This restaurant was great. I loved the atmosphere, it was in a part of Pittsburgh that I had never been to. I loved the Paella, it had a great variety of spanish sausage, lobster tails, and many other things. It was great food.
0	Bx3OuSsKp06nzDWckdOIQ	One of our  favorite restaurants for the excellent food.  I do recommend a reservation because the place is rather small and gets really packed at peak dining times. Everything I have had here is outstanding - especially the handmade pasta (ask your server which  is made in house), the pizzas, the salads, and each seafood entree that I have had is cooked to perfection.  They have really good hummus made in house.  I love the decor.  The wine list is nice - but a couple of times we have had our wine served at the wrong temperatures which affected our enjoyment of the wine.  I have to admit that the service has been hit or miss... sometimes we have great service, and other times it is less than stellar.  Overall, we are willing to overlook the indiscretions because the food is so good!   Every dessert we have had is delish.  Its hard to go wrong here in terms of food.  However, if you're not careful, you can easily drop a big wad of cash at dinner time.  But if you are frugal, you can have an excellent dinner for a reasonable amount.
0	xmb2UTB1PRjVwTP5fAw43Q	I went here for a dinner when we were in Las Vegas for a a bachelor party.  There were four of us, and we arrived we were forced to wait which was rather confusing because the restaurant was pretty empty.  Anyway, we only had to wait for about 10 minutes, so no big deal. Except, because the place was pretty empty we thought we'd get a good table with a view.  Not so much.  We got a booth facing the middle of the place.  whatever, no problem,  the view wasn't that important to us.    I forget our waiter's name but he was really helpful and a funny dude.  He helped us pick a bottle of wine ( I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty cheap and really good).  For aps, we ordered Crudo (kinda like a sashimi dish) , Arancino (rissotto ball),  crab cakes.  We had one more, but I forget what it was, prob a seafood dish.  Everbody really liked their aps, and my Arancino was fantastic.  We also ordered a bowl of Sunday Gravy (pasta, meatballs) for everyone to split.  The waiter was really cool and told us we only need half of it, and gave us a half portion, and everyone loved the Sunday Gravy.  Even the half portion was huge.  Oh, I forgot, the breads they served us before the aps were really good too.     On to the dinners, I was kind of boring and got the chicken parm.  It was the best chicken parm Ive ever had in my life, hands down.  The portion was also HUGE!.  I also had the garlic mashed potatoes which were good, a lil on the strong side. I felt horrible throwing it out, because it was just that good.  My friend ordered their specialty, the osso bucco, which was perfect.  We def ordered way too much food, and realized we could have probably eaten here for very cheap.  As some other reviewers stated, you get to go to the playboy club/moon for free afterwards, which is nice.  Overall, this place compares to the top italian rest in NYC, and I think came out to about $90/person with wine and probably about twice as much food as we actually needed.  I recommend Nove to anyone I know that is going to Vegas.  Great for couples or groups of friends, probably not children.    Nove was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the whole situation at the beginning.
0	ctB2119eFvxYlT7EfjLY1w	Good solid Thai food.  None of their food particular makes this place stick out from the other thai places in the area, but this is a good place for a consistently good food in a pretty convenient location for those in Urbana.
0	4379bjeZgxfJsAX7Ne9BHA	The slowest chipotle by far, be ready to wait ...  It was Saturday evening and the place was packed!!! The line was going out the door. I am used to long lines at Chipotle, but they usually move pretty fast. People who work there are always very quick and on top of their tasks. Well not the case here. I understand that work area needs to be cleaned and more food ordered, but when you have 20 people waiting in line forever you have to move. My bf walked over to Paradise Bakery, waited in line there, had his sandwich prepared, walked back and still waited about 5-8 minutes with me. Only I I wasn't that hungry, no way I would wait that long
0	R8xP2Cgp4zMRZ9D5g0Vg	This Subway is near the center of my weekly journeys.  When a known brand sandwich is craved,  this is an excellent stop. Multi-lingual, Spanish and English spoken.  "Five Dollar Foot Long" has a much better ring than "Five Dollar and Seventy Five Cent Foot Long." That is the base price for a one-foot sandwich here.
0	3XjnGkRNcHdzsMCnSuQ	I'm going to give this place 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm going to return and... I have hope, you guys, I really do...  BUT... went here last Friday at lunchtime. Pulled up, place seemed extraordinarily sketchy, but my work friend and I were game. We parked and walked up only to find the place completely boarded up. There was spray paint that read 'Closed' on one of the doors-- is the place closed??  I heard people inside, so I walked over to the other door, which had a sign stating their hours. Too bad their hours were covered up with Sharpie-drawn hearts. What???  I tried to pull open the door, since I heard people inside the house/shack/restaurant, but the door must have been locked or rusted shut, because I couldn't open it.  We tried to find their hours online a head of time, but the website... dear Lord. Please invest in a friend or someone to update and fix whatever that mess is!  So, no I didn't get to eat at Aside of Heart. I have no idea when they're open, although according to Yelp it's 24/7.  I typically don't review places I haven't tried, but I'm asking for help here-- what is going on with this place?  My work friend and I are vegetarian, so like I said, we will be returning. Probably not on a Friday- maybe they're closed Fridays? We'll try it on a Wednesday...  Until then-- maybe someone could message me and give me a heads up when their hours are?? I'd really like to go!

Use canned products whenever possible. Cook omelet until it reaches the consistency of styrofoam. 3. Roughly chop some potatoes and cook only until they are slightly browned on one side. Remember step #1. 4. Plate your creation. 5. Lay a Kraft Singles cheese slice on top the whole mess.  Adding one star because the servers were attentive and the patio is nice.

First, marginal food.  Maybe it will satisfy the taste buds of non Italians, but certainly not those of New York Italians!  From the tangy somewhat bitter tomato sauce to the very tough (like shoe leather tough) eggplant parmigiana we were so disappointed.  The only bright spot in our meal was the Ceaser salad and the very friendly server.  As for the owners, now they have quite a lesson to learn in customer relations and interactions. While looking at the menu we noticed one of the pizza entrees was called "Astoria" pizza.  We asked if that was so because an owner came from that city in NY?  The waitress said she thought so and would ask.  She did, and when she came back to take our order she said yes, he moved from there.  My husband said to tell him that we did also and told her briefly what area of Astoria and that we used to go to the local pizzerias there.  We asked if he was there tonight, and she said "Yes, somewhere."  Now really, the place is all of about 2000 square feet...  Needless to say, we saw her telling him, he was standing just behind our booth and close to the register.  Not once did he come over or acknowledge any of the customers.  We took that as disinterest, which most business owners can hardly afford nowadays.  So out we went after our so so meal, vowing not to return to try the pizza which didn't look too bad.    And of course we will be telling everyone we meet up with about our experience there.  We live in a community where going out to eat for most is a few times a week happening.

When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it "mild" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.    So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.    Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha  Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.
0	kjKtBhXCHOyY7sm4w2V9w	What a difference location makes. Notice this Red Robin has a higher rating than the others. They are flexible with menu changes or substituions (which I often ask for). The food is tasty, portions gererous, servers friendly & the prices reasonable. It's kid friendly, so for my tastes it's a bit noisy, but that's alright. They are worth driving out of your way for.
0	kM2E5U4LtcgWct6pMEd2Q	This place is very wallet friendly-$1 Margaritas, $2 Sangria, $3 Beers and the food prices aren't bad at all. They had an extensive menu and I opted for the pollo nachos which were great and the sangria was good for $2. I wasn't impressed with the margarita (even after I got the extra shot for $1), like some others said it was completely sugar ridden and not good. The salsa was bland and I've had better such as the generic brand at the supermarket.  Service wise, I am agreeing with it others it was pretty bad. Our server didn't have knowledge of the menu or how to spell mojito (I served for six yrs so I am very understanding when it comes to service but you should know whats on the menu) and she kept stopping by to see if we needed our check when we were ordering rounds of drinks and going to be there for awhile. It was a little too loud for me also and really difficult to carry on a conversation so this place would probably be good for those with kids who tend to get a little loud.  All in all, if you're looking for mediocre food, cheap drinks and a loud atmosphere this is the place for you.
0	i2sz3M6DARiVfHbFTUsA	The day that I went to eat here it was almost 2 in the afternoon and the place was dirty. There were 2 of us here and 7 employees and just about every table was dirty. I decided to ask for some napkins and cleaned my own table.  Once I got my sandwich I thought it was ok. I don't think I'll be back.  I remember Jimmy Johns from Illinois State University but this is definitely not the Jimmy Johns of ISU!
0	m0IzFHoCTlqfmkxhQJaNWQ	Update:  My INITIAL review was about an experience that was about six months ago.  In the meantime, a lot of the issues have been solved and my only overlying issue was with the size of the rolls on 10/6/2009.  Just a clarification! :)
0	aN70d8y7FuBN4mhGAxqygw	As a parent this was not the place to take a kid, no kid menu. As an adult I thought it was a huge establishment that should have had more going for it. Perhaps I will try it out again in a couple months because the food was okay but nothing special.
0	Dhr1mUVsMSZCNZ6OuHYtQ	Crab legs, sushi, clams, teriyaki, chocolate fondue.  This place has sushi selections that are superior in freshness and quality.   Although regretfully, I didn't partake in as much all-you-can-eat action as I would have liked [we ended up drinking 8 bottles of warm sake between 3 people, which can really kill an appetite], what I did experience [before inebriation took over] was crisp, clean sushi and a wide variety of tasty rolls. They even have some of the deep fried kind!  Dessert consists of various cakes and tarts, and a giant waterfall of flowing chocolate! Fruit and poundcake are proffered nearby with skewers for some chocolate dipping delight. How can anyone go wrong with that?!
0	d29JRpuT3AGKCIsMInd4A	Okay concept, poorly executed.  Visited on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. My biggest grief with this place is that they served me a warm beer. A warm beer! When I called the waitress out on it, she said, "Well I don't know how that could have happened." She was nice enough to replace it at no cost but seriously.   The table next to us was full of tourists who all ordered Spotted Cows and the waitress said they were out. Really? You're a pub in downtown Madison called the Tipsy Cow and you're out of Madison's favorite beer?   My fiance liked his burger, I ordered a BLT which I figured would be hard to mess up. It wasn't spectacular. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were good, but it doesn't take a genius to serve French fries covered in truffle oil with a side of garlic aoli. Of course it's going to be good.  I expected a lot more out of the place and was disappointed. It will be awhile before we give it another try.
0	usyX1uzvnh0eIjfM9RMphw	Decent Thai food, skip the rest of the menu. Pad Thai was really good but opt for tofu and stay away from anything that has beef or chicken in it.  I'm not sure where they get there meat from but its absolutely horrible with a very strong gamey/rotten taste. That is most likely why the food is really cheap. Aside from that the service is great and the thai iced coffee and tea are good.
0	mpG6iTwFAeZgWHa9WMywww	This place opened on 8/2/11. Ketzal Mexican used to be here, but Plaza Bonita took over after Ketzal failed. This place is slightly better than Ketzal. The staff is very friendly, but the food was average to below average. Chips were boring. Salsa boring. Beans, cheese, and beef dip was weird but ok. The Macho Burrito wasn't very "macho" and wasn't very good either. My wife thought it was ok, but I thought it was below average. I'd give it a 1 out of 5. She'd give it a 3 out of 5. Either way, not great and this place won't get very good reviews in the future.
0	i0XAwL4ubBhVucPIV0RmYA	Good place... the patio is huge and awesome... i went there on a winter night and the amount of heaters that they had made it so warm that i did not need a jacket... the food was very good... i only had soup and dessert, but the other people i was with loved the chicken and the special salad... i did not try the key lime pie but loved the turtle sunday... i look forward to going back and trying more things on the menu... and for the area the prices were not too bad....
0	UcdsuSyZbu9sSCxYnXXUdQ	The Skeptical Chymist, aside from having one of my favorite names of all Scottsdale bars, makes a bold claim: to be Scottsdale's ONLY Authentic Irish Restaurant and Pub.   From a happy hour beer and appetizer there today, it's hard to say whether they made good on that. What I can say, though, is that the chicken tenders were on point and the happy hour special was pretty impressive.   They are featuring three dollar Harp draughts right now, as well, which is nothing to shake a stick at.   They showcase quite a bit of live music, and with a big crowd, the layout in here would make for a great time.  A little pricey, as Irish pubs tend to be, but a good find nevertheless.
0	EG2D31LTbiXsRlSGa27VWQ	I try to come here at least once every trip.  The main reason?  The mussels.  I don't usually like mussels but this place has the BEST on the planet.  I could just eat that alone and make a meal out of it.  It's a big whopping plate of mussels cooked in a ultra flavorful red broth.  Comes with toasted garlic herb bread too!  I realized by coming here why I didn't like mussels before.  It's because most places don't use fresh mussels.  This place does.  There is absolutely no fishiness at all.  Just sweet tasty morsels.  I know they use fresh mussels because on a recent trip there I wasn't able to order them because the supplier didn't have any that day.  The main course are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Their Sangria is pretty good, it would be better if they didn't fill the little cup with so much ice.  This place is worth 4 stars just on the mussels alone :)
0	VBJSZP41Ot4HTBqhHHFZkg	I gave it four stars for its tie back to my home in Chicago.  However, if I did not have that emotional tie in, it would have only gotten three stars.  Why?     I felt the counter service was a bit lacking for my takeout order.  Slow, tideous, disappearing counter guy was to blame.  Secondly, the calamari was subpar for my tastes - a big disappointment.  The Pizza is the reason to go here.  I had a rugular crust (note this is thick crust, not pan pizza) with sausage, pepperoni, onion and green pepper.  This pizza was spot on what I was looking for.  The sausage was delicious, sauce abundant, cheese overflowing and crips veggies.  Excellent pizza - great memories of the previous 40 years of eating the same Pizza in Berwyn and Oak Park, IL.  I will give them another shot.  I will try to dine in next time.  I have to say - their restaurant side of the house was well used on a Sunday night at 6PM.  Doing some good business there.  Second side note - you can buy italian bulk and susage links from the the takeout counter, among other items.

A review is in store for providing a memory that will be stamped in my head forever.

0	mYlHKDxw0mFgjbXAf3fhEA	Who can complain when you're dealing with 99 cent margaritas? After I order a couple and a large fried quesadilla, I'll even forget that I recently read Via Delosantos received the worst report in 2004 for their numerous major Health Department violations!
0	aJhHsAG7Vu63TAIVd86yJA	I used to come here nearly every day to work (finishing a dissertation). Pastries are very good, decent food, coffee is better than acceptable, and everything at excellent prices. There's free wi-fi. The staff is warm. Decent music at a reasonable volume. Local art on the walls. Nice place.  BUT... the owner prefers to leave the door open--even when it's wet and cold (as in 2 degrees) outside. The bathroom is dirty, and the main floor doesn't seem to get swept very often. Also, the owner has become sarcastic and unpleasant of late. I can no longer recommend this place, except as an place to grab inexpensive pastries for carry-out. So, good for carry-out, but you're taking your chances if you choose to eat in.
0	GV65ybelGxiopbKh7oSjg	Table 274 is a new restaurant in the Cotswold area. The decor is interesting, it looks like they may be planning some chef/customer interactive experiences, as I observed bar stools near the kitchen area.   We had:  The mushroom confit. It was tasty, but I just don't understand why it is called "confit"...a mushroom has no fat in which to cook...the waiter said it was simmered in olive oil...it was an interesting taste and texture, but I still did not understand the description.   I was soon to discover that the waiter had no idea what he was talking about when we ordered the cheese plate. He described a cheese from the Appalachian Mountains as a strong, stinky cheese. We ordered that, the brie and the blue. The Appalacian was basically brie!  Also, on the cheese tray, there was a disproportionate amount of blue cheese, a huge chunk compared to the 3 slices each of brie and Appalacian.   My recommendation: Ask some questions before ordering.  The pork belly was delicious, smooth, fatty and yummy. I don't understand what "pork jam" is, but would probably rather not ask. The menu says it comes with a yukon crisp, but what we got was burned and oily.  Beef Short Rib and Sweet Potato Gnocchi. By the time it got to the table, I had forgotten that short ribs were part of the dish, which is a good thing, as there were none on the dish! The gnocchi, however, were light, fluffy and very tasty. Honestly it was one of the highlights, and I did not even remember the short rib part until I sat down to write this review! (it was 3 stars before I realized this oversight)  We had avocado mousse for dessert, the mousse itself was delicious, but was served in a kind of coconut, waffle cone type bowl that was stale and gummy. The waiter commented that they get the bowl from a nearby bakery, and some days it is very crispy and some times it is gummy. I would have rather skipped the stale waffle bowl altogether.  There are a few reasons for the low review, and I hope the restaurant gets better in time.   We got rolls, they were stale and cold, and really not good tasting.  Water. We ordered pelligrino, and waited forever for it. I think the waiter forgot, and I finally asked someone else if they could check on it, it was only then it was brought.   I really wanted to like this restaurant, and will check on the reviews...if it gets better, in time, we may give it another chance.
0	pjUzwtzFBiH4D5EOjv2eEw	This is by far one of the best Mediterranean fast food restaurants I've been to.  I ordered the 1/4 Flame Grilled Chicken that came with white or dark chicken meat served on a bed of rice and side of garlic sauce.  the price was decent ($8.35) plus tax.  It was the best chicken I've had in a long time.    The atmosphere was laid back and relaxed.  I loved the fact their menus that hang above the cashier was big and very legible.  It was very clean inside and even had a hookah lounge towards the back.  The decorations were colorful and the set up was almost like a food court setting with all the chairs and tables spread out with a good amount of space.  I was also  amazed by how nice the cashier was and helpful too.   Only thing I don't like was the rice.  It tasted old and off.  Despite that, I would go back again for the chicken, salad, and hummus.  Mmmm... hummus.
0	UtFzZApU0dGhogcsHVeF1w	Miko is possibly best described as a laid-back version of KoFusion, which is unsurprising since it is owned by the same group of people.  Miko has teppanyaki though, which I guess sets it apart.  Also, the "Champaign Roll" at KoFusion is called the "Urbana Roll" at Miko (since KoFusion is in Champaign and MiKo is in Urbana).  Hilarious!  It's wierd that I think I actually like Miko better than KoFusion, because it is more laid back, but I go to KoFusion much, much more because of the $1 sushi.  The staff at Miko has always been friendlier than at KoFusion, for whatever reason, but the bar is not as good.    Anyway, try the Dragon Roll.  Top Notch
0	Om6HRMsJkXfWQbd05HZwA	Mr Burrito moved into Salsitas.   Drove in to get my usual breakfast burritos.  Got a shock at the window, the prices doubled!!   Then after waiting 15 minutes.  The glazed girl at the window forgot half my order and gave me the " What are you talking about look"   She mentioned a new owner and then I got worried.   I got fuzzy scorched eggs with a tiny amount of meat. No Cheese no NADA!   Their salsa is nasty.  Nothing worse then scorched eggs.  Twice the cost and bad food.  Such a deal.    Back to FILIBERTOS!
0	tvez5AMwppKrHJzVFSJGEA	I'm writing this review a little late as we visited in the last week of June.  I will try to remember the details.   Environment: Beautiful Service:  Excellent Mojitos:  Awesome  Food:  Great  The in depth talk in the lobby with the resident artist:  Priceless.
0	5qzkszc0NFBpWW9aE2sw	As others have mentioned.. service at this place can't be beat. Your soda is a ripoff at $3, but at least it's refilled quickly!   As for the food... I did try a very non-Greek dish as I was pretending to eat healthy (grilled chicken). It was tasty, but at the end of the day it was just grilled chicken! The reason why they are getting 3 stars instead of 4 was the Greek salad. It seems all dishes come with this, and wow was it good! I'm a Greek salad fan, and this one was one of the best I've had. Minimal olives.. loads of feta.. and the feta was perfectly crumbled as to make every bite fetalicious! The dressing they used rocked too. Loved the salad so much. They served warm rolls with lunch too. I wish they served pita bread or something more "greek", but the rolls were yummy.   I'll write an update on these guys once I go back and eat something more "greek" rather than grilled chicken. My dining companion tried the stuffed cabbage leaves. I stole a bite and they seemed really yummy and she cleared her plate!
0	laBPERc9Ou9bsq1OvsBVyw	I love the food at Sa-Bai Thong. People can debate, but they had me at scallion dumplings.  There were more shrimp in the Tom Kha on the west side, and was it just me or was the pork a little more flavorful?  The service, as always, is unpredictable.   The space is less intimate here than the mutiple booths that break up the one on University. But there is a nice framed view.
0	VjJempJhjk0I6rUUML74Dg	It always kills me to write a negative review, when the idea and the execution was good, but a staff full of arrogant kids brought the whole thing down like a boat anchor. The worst part about when this happens, is that it usually starts with a good idea, lots of enthusiasm, a creative menu, and a ton of money.....and you have to wonder after it crashes and burns, if they ever do realize that it was the self-centered staff that actually did them in. Such is the case here with the Meatball Spot. We arrived at 6:30pm, and there were 4 people at the hostess stand. We approached, and they were chatting amongst themselves, so we waited. And waited. And waited. At around the 2 minute mark, it was laughable, so my wife says to me, "Should we set ourselves on fire?". This prompted someone to tear themselves away briefly (from what was only a personal conversation mind you, not a business crisis), and say, "Just the 2 of you?", followed by "There's a 20min wait, do you want to get on the waiting list?". We said yes. Then, they took our last name, then our first name, then (for some reason) our phone number. No greeting, no politeness, just the facts, and that was it, then back to their private conversation. We interrupted one more time, and asked if we could wait at the bar, to which thy replied, "Sure, if there's room". There was. Now, here's a bit of an unfair generalization that my wife likes to make, and it used to make me angry, until it proved true so many times that I no longer had a leg to stand on. I'll preface this by saying that my wife is a stickler for the perfect dirty martini. So when she ordered a remedial drink, I asked why she didn't get a martini, to which she replied, "The staff is too beautiful to make a good martini". And the broader generalization she is making here, is her own observation that the more picturesque the staff is in a given service-industry venue, the worse the service is going to be. Now again, I used to get angry at this generalization, but I've come to accept it as being true, far more often than false. So I really take the place in. All of the hostesses, the wait staff, the bartenders, even the bussers were all right out of a fashion magazine.  Then, everything just fell like dominoes. Busser grabbed my drink before I was finished, unattentive bartender needed to be flagged down before I could get another, 30 minutes later, we asked for a menu, and decided since our table wasn't ready (half of the table were empty mind you) that we'd get apps at the bar. When apps were done, we ordered dinner. The server didn't write down the order, as is so trendy to do now. It was a simple 4-topping pizza, so I asked her to repeat it, and she repeated 3 out of 4. I repeated the 4, and she repeated a different 3 out of the four. I repeated it again, this time counting on my fingers, so at least she'd have the four-finger visual in her head. But no, the pizza came out with only 3 toppings anyhow. In any case, the pizza was actually pretty good. But the service was such a joke, beginning to end, that it did not matter.  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And in las Vegas, the customer service capital of the world, that had better be your strongest link. Here, it was their weakest, and that will be their undoing. There are so many good choices in Las Vegas, I have no reason whatsoever to return to this establishment.
0	tPRIsqUApLCdMmq06LuPyg	Went to dinner on a Tuesday night, was greeted and seated right away. Our waiter was slow and acted like he was slammed all night even though he only had a few tables to oversee. Our food took a long time to come out. Wings are good here but do not get the kid's dyno bites. They were bland-no taste. One of our sides was written down wrong by the waiter. Refills on our drinks took several minutes.
0	Gvq5Uo2r52jTgoGwaHlyhQ	What's the big deal about this place?!? The burgers taste the same like any other burger joint. The Fries are nothing special either! The food is priced well but what's all the hype about?   Am I missing something here?  This is a normal burger joint and almost everyone is saying this is the best burger ever? Really?!?  Sorry, nothing special here.
0	Eq0CFmYDB8dFAXULHis7qQ	This has to be one of the funniest named restaurants ever.  Besides that, meh. I was confused by the decor. They left it the way the previous restaurant had it, so it's modern, and then picnic tablecloths on the tables?? The food was ok-I had the half chicken. Nothing terribly exciting but good. You get this huge chunk of corn bread (with real corn kernels visible), which was good too. We waited a good 20 minutes before our food came out; not sure if that's standard wait time for a BBQ place. it was ok-don't know if I'd go back.
0	93QaxrWOxkI6XXLVe4A	The hype didn't live up to my expectations... but I figured this place out.  If you want the quality of a fast food burger and fries but want a nice place to eat at... you go to the Habit.    The build-out of the restaurant is great, looks like a Chipotle, but the burger looks and taste like Burger King.    I got the Charburger, onion rings and a drink for $7.17 w/ tax which seems a bit much for an average burger.  However, the customer services was great, the manager even came over to say hello.  I'm not coming back unless someone wants to buy me lunch.
0	BvReYkohdmBqf73m0u2M3g	I took a lychee bubble tea to go.  It was $3.50 and it was fine.  I think you can get the same thing at Harmonie bakery a few doors over for $3.00, don't know about the size difference.  The place seemed a bit grungy and run down.  There were some well-used looking board games (chess and some others).  Generally, looked like an ok place for teenagers to hang out, have some bubble tea and play games.  I wouldn't recommend it for anything else.  There was a food menu but I didn't try it this time.
0	FRPzFOdsic4oVa0amgYQ	This Port of Subs has some great specials right now- on Saturdays, 2-foot longs are $10.99 and Sundays, all cold footlongs are $5. You can't beat that with a stick!  Now on the sandwich hierarchy, I'd put Port of Subs above Subway any day. As good as Port of Subs is, it still isn't Capriotti's.   This particular location is one of my favorites - it's always clean and very rarely crowded. There are lots of tables and a clean bathroom.
0	NMzfleHYaPWUKWXkPK6A	Yes this place is a dive so be forewarned.  Honey Bee's has moved a few times over the years and is now located in a little shopping center on the borderline of Penn Hills and Wilkinsburg. The location can be a little sketchy at night. It is a pretty ghetto take out only spot so you will be getting your food to go when you visit. One time I ask for a takeout menu and the women behind the counter told me to take a picture of the menu on the wall! Really?   The main attraction here is the fried chicken wings which most of the time are hit or miss. The last few times I had them they just weren't any good. They were lacking flavor and were just too small and made me will like I was eating a baby pigeon. They do offer burgers, salads, sandwiches and hoagies as well but I have never tried them.  The sides are the only saving grace for this place. They offer the usual suspects, mac n cheese, greens, green beans, potato salad and more. The last few times I've gotten my chicken elsewhere and just came here for the sides.  As others have said the place is in desperate need of the Restaurant Makeover treatment.  It just breaks my heart that Pittsburgh doesn't have one really nice sit down Soul Food restaurant where you can get a wide variety of things. You have to go one place for ribs and another of fried chicken and yet another for sides. Yes, there's Carmi which is very good but their menu is lacking. And there's Savoy, but at those high prices I don't consider that to be soul food.   When I have a taste for wings I'll just go to the nearby Genuine Pub or to Mohan's as they are both superior in every way and just get my sides for either Showcase BBQ or Honey Bees.
0	oByRewQ98IAcopCHivRfoA	To my surprise(and disappointment) the Springs Cafe at the Springs Preserve is no longer under Wolfgang Puck but instead now ran by the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas. They did stay within the same food guidlines as the previous owner which is to continue to offer a sustainable dining selection. We went during the Halloween festivities and there was a special Halloween menu which was overpriced and not really a good selection of items. I thought it was odd that the boo burger didn't come with any veggies - no lettuce no tomato, nothing. Hello, isn't this place is supposed to promote healthy eating? No veggies? Why? So basically I got a bun, a burger (which seemed like it came out of your grocers freezer) and a slice of cheese. It reminded me of food while eating in a school cafeteria. Not $9.00 worthy at all!!! The kid's meals also had those darn frozen dino nuggets and pizza sticks that you can find at Walmart. Is the food fresh here or what? Too bad about the food as the view & setting in this restrauant is beautiful. I know the employees are students but whomever is instructing them needs to step up his/her teaching quickly or there won't be anyone to serve.
0	e8mX3tIkGDCaERHUsW8b8g	Over priced for a burger joint with really thin patties. I just moved to the area and I was looking for something close to a Tams burger in Los Angeles. Food was ok. If you plan on dinning in try to eat your food quickly before it gets cold. Since they have a ceiling fan directly over your table (on full blast). French fries look like seasoned fries but aren't. I think they just don't change the oil out. I'd suggest take out.
0	Hsk4Kgex4epoCIbRngIftw	See the picture I posted. It's like they tried to kill the food. Deep-fried, and then there is "I left it in the deep fryer for 20 minutes too long". I guess this would be good food if you're completely drunk. At least it's cheap delivery, hence the two stars.
0	NXyM4xSYQkMnj1iPzchk3A	We ate in the lounge - drinks were great, music seemed pretty solid to me.  Cover band really put the vibe at a much lower key given the price and atmosphere - a lot more comfortable than you might expect given the decor.  Also lack of people there - the whole restaurant, not just the lounge, was not busy at all at 7:30-10:30ish on a Saturday night.    Food - deserving of four stars.  The specials were by all accounts amazing, no one had anything left over.  Skip dessert was the consensus among my group.
0	rDdurUuwaNNCbI5MxSoIA	Excellent deli food, great ice cream, and a crazy fun atmosphere.  It's definitely a place that needs to be seen to be understood.  The food itself is not extraordinary but quite good for the style.  There are other places I would recommend for "just food" in Madison, but the atmosphere and environment add so much to the experience.  I would recommend this as a place to check out for lunch, probably not dinner.    The ice cream is also a great after-meal treat.  They come in a variety of great flavors.
0	9Y2A7wScUlqJJHoPaxwnA	Worst America's Taco Shop location I've been to. I typically go to the 7th St. and McDowell location. My burrito came out incorrectly, and it's just beans and cheese. The service was horrible. The staff whistled at us to let us know our burritos were ready despite the fact that (a) they gave us a number and (b) we were literally a foot away.
0	ihbs6HSnSYGsiqta1pxzVw	I've eaten here several times over the past few months, and have generally been impressed by the quality of the food and service. However, on my most recent trip, my experience left a bit to be desired. The teenager making my sandwich ignored my request to leave the onions off of my sandwich (or couldn't hear my response over the loud music, and didn't confirm), and when I took it back up to get it remade without onions, they simply picked the onions out and put it on a new sub roll (and of course missed some in the process). In my many years eating at Quiznos, I have come to expect better service than that, and I will not be returning to this one.
0	N6hvEzBTfQlIaXbVJ49UEg	i went to this place last week with my sister and two other people who have never tried Indian food, and we all loved it. We had the Indian sampler for $30 and the Vertical Vindaloo and it was all delicious. The sampler, one other entree and extra order of naan was enough for the 4 of us. The service was also great. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who wanted to try Indian or even just something different.
0	Rc7LUBRsDwA3D7idQVwGVQ	Best milkshakes ever!! I would definitely call ahead & order cause the wait is forever which I understand because everything is made to order. The burgers are great though & the milkshakes are made with ice cream!
0	Og0AxMu73TyThLrKvGwP8w	this place is popular for locals, particularly ethnic locals.  the food is quite authentic from what i understand. i've had many Ethiopian restaurant experiences and this place isn't the BEST but very far from the worst.  the food is more like home cooking style and very cheap. i've been a patron for over 5 years. the best about the place is the quiet-cozy-dark atmosphere and late night hours and healthy ingredients. the staff is incredible friendly and accommodating for vegetarian and vegan diets.  i highly recommend this place for casual first dates :)
0	3ugN5I7C188BgXu4k4qTXg	I really enjoyed this place. The lady that helped me was super friendly. The pizza was really good. Really crispy and delicious. They also have happy hour between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. everyday. $2.50 Bud Light pints and $4 pitchers. They also have wine and other alcoholic choices available all the time. The only bummer about this place is that they require a $5 minimum purchase if you use a credit or debit card, but the pizza is good enough that you will want an extra slice anyways.
0	T4Cu2HQp3hfgHsBPHa38CA	I really wanted to like this place.  The food is ok, not spectacular.  The prices for main dishes is reasonable.  We've been twice and both times my wife had ordering problems.  She prefers her enchilada in a flour tortilla and they absolutely refused to do it.  The second time we decided to get Chimichaungas.  We asked them to be enchilada style and they wanted an additional $3 for that...That seemed out of whack.  They finally agreed to do it for a dollar.  Also, if you eat in you get free chips but not if you take out.  So that became an argument.  The chimi's had decent flavor but lacked filling.  I would agree to under seasoned food.  Though we probably won't return I don't think it is awful.  Hopefully they will read the comments on here and make some adjustments to price.
0	ZocPRlxlq9gcNcdY0EFOyg	The pizza is ok, not great. It is also a bit over priced. However, customer service is pretty bad. The young girl that took my order was impolite and acting as she was making me a favor. Anyway, try it out, not bad but be cautions of people working there.
0	Yqu4EFHDR2PSIrpFZMhaA	Food is covered in grease. It's dim sum in a mall, so don't really expect much unless you absolutely need a dim sum fix. Overall the food is a little bland.  The staff is friendly and they have a decent variety, but if you're a dim sum fanatic, this spot isn't for you.
0	WPkiAON35G7d3xP73j6Q	As I may have mentioned before, I am forever on a quest here in Charlotte for a great pizza pie.  Knowing that Jet's has a deep dish pizza, I was quite excited to try it (especially since I had a Groupon to do so cheaply).  However, Jet's wasn't quite my cup of tea, so I will continue my quest.  My partner and I decided to try the Jet 10 pizza in deep dish and the Jet's Bread.  The bread used the same dough as the deep dish pizza, I am relatively certain.  However, the bread just didn't have enough garlic on it for my taste, so it was mostly just dough and cheese.  I really did not care for the marinara sauce there at all, as it was a very sweet marinara.  I am not at all a fan of sweet marinara sauces, so if you like them on the sweet side, this one is probably pretty good.  The bread itself was mildly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so it had a good texture.  The portion size on the bread was pretty generous for the money, so that was good.  Not very often do you find places that have a square deep dish pizza.  You can't really see the outside crust, as the toppings go all the way out to the corners.  I was pretty excited about that.  I liked the variety of toppings on the Jet 10.  However, Jet's suffers from the same downfall of pizza chain deep dish in that it was mostly dough and easy on the toppings.  Again, their pizza sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweet sauce at Pizza Hut (think big New Yorker or the stuffed crust), you will probably love the sauce.  I know that you can normally pick a flavor for the crust, but my impression was that you could not get that on the deep dish.  I am honestly not sure about that.  Now, dining in here is pretty great, I will say.  Our bread sticks came out in about 10 minutes, and they served them on a metal platter on a stand.  It was all very nice looking.  Our pizza came about 5 minutes later, also on a platter and stand.  The dining area was clean and not terribly cluttered at this location.  The employees were friendly and quick.  If you like a sweeter sauce on your pizza, I am guessing that you might appreciate this place a little more than I did.  Our pizza was hot and fresh, but very mediocre otherwise.  However, I am still holding out for a more perfect pizza place in the Queen City.
0	v3w8kRUpoTPrMcHPccdw	Only Thai place open on a Sunday in downtown Phoenix.  That being said, it was my only choice so I made the best of it.  My summer roll was not good, so bad in fact, I sent it back.  I don't usually do that either but in this case, the lettuce was brown and there were literally two pieces of tofu in the entire roll.  The Panang curry, my dish of choice, was average but my Thai pudding with sticky rice was great.  Wouldn't give this place a second chance but the staff was friendly to say the least.
0	VxAJyKbJZChKhQS5toMHw	Rough neighborhood, lock your doors. Decent food at decent prices. Use side entrance next to the circle K. Location signage needs improved. The breakfast is their main dish, so the hours reflect. Family owned and ran business.
0	xn4xYnHUs7qaTqxIOeqww	Worst IHOP ever. Fries burnt, waffle burnt, I had to chase my waitress around the whole place just to get my coffee creamer. Never got my second drink. Put the bill right on the napkins we were using, face up and taped it multiple times to make sure we saw it. The only saving grace that keeps me from giving one star was the buser. He was more helpful then two servers.
0	CtNhHVyJxv2IemaVShxluQ	Perry H. says it best, "I love Lonestar!"  We go to the one in Corona, CA all the time and have been to this Vegas one a number of times. Only once can I recall where the food was disappointing. The rest of the times it has been delicious.  An interesting note, the Vegas place serves mini-loafs of bread while in CA they use rolls. Both are yummy.  I've heard that Lonestar might be going out of business; PLEASE DON'T BE TRUE!  If any so-called steak place should tank, it's Sizzler. But Lone Star is the quintessential steak place for someone on a budget.  Long live the wedge salad and lonestar potato!
0	hpPaagoStkU52lOuewqLg	Do NOT believe the reviews that denigrate the flavor of this food. They make a great gyro, either chicken or beef. The chicken souvlaki might be the best in town. I've had it in many upscale places, but this little corner store just knows what they're doing.  It DOES take time to get your food. It's NOT fast food. If you want that, go to a freaking Jack in the box and leave the restaurant eating to the grownups.
0	ae70fIrhHT3E1Tm2PruQ	Yum!  I was impressed by this place, expecting a regular deli.  What I got was a large selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and baked potatoes.  The service is good and the restaurant itself is big and open with lots of natural light.  I will definitely go back and probably have just as difficult a time deciding what I want from their impressive menu.  The only sour thing I have to say is that my boyfriend is convinced that the shrimp in his gumbo was tainted and made him ill.  I cannot prove this... My sandwich was great!
0	fSxVdWiRvgFk3wIl6Nzukg	I really want to like this place since it's close and I've liked the original full service place. However, each time I've gone I leave feeling like I really didn't get much for what I paid for. Think I'll stick with Costa Vita on Baseline & Val Vista.
0	BHdZytTJoTQmR9p6W01mUg	Mediocre food, but lightning fast...and considering the other options in the stratosphere tower...probably the place to go.  They have a fairly simple menu, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and salad.  You can see the grill where they sizzle up your meat o' choice, shredded chicken or beef, ground beef, etc... Everything has standard rice and beans on the side.  The purist in me feels they should at least have nopales (ummm it is your restaurant name) but no luck.   This is \u00fcber basic tex-mex.    Anytime I'm there, it's usually pretty empty. Maybe one group eating...but never a line.    It'll do.
0	J0KLoJqMJxsomhGpF2whw	Imagine a Hooters where the girls cut their outfits in half. That is about the only reason to go to this place. It's a decent sports bar for guys to hang out in but not for familys or with your wife. Lots of beers on tap, unfortunately they serve them at ice cold 29 degrees temperature which is ok for your bud light, coors light drinker but for craft beer it should be served at around 40 degrees. Hello McFly!!!  Food was typical bar food for the most part with a few modern choices. The meatloaf is more like just a hamburger patty than real meatloaf IMHO. The place specializes in breasts, and not chicken breasts.
0	zILzLd3T1GJSBB86SsfPNw	The flavors are not true to the names. The Watermelon flavor tasted like liquid Amoxicillin. Also the customer service was not up to par. They were extremely inattentive, I was left at the counter for about 15 minutes without so much as a look and the woman behind me was overcharged. There was a very nice girl working who apologized for the inconvenience and an extremely rude girl who managed to ruin the entire experience for me and my family.
0	VvofiDBSxttO7NSKY78q1Q	4 stars because i only had beer there, but didn't order food even though everything(!) on their menu looked awesomely german.  great place to get a decently priced delicious beer off-the-strip (it's about 0.5 or .75 mi away -- walkable, but take a cab if you're lazy and it's 90+ degrees out).  the beers are delicious!!  and our bartender was friendly and attentive.  the hefeweizen was perfect, in my opinion, with a hint of citrus.  i really should have ordered a whole liter instead of half.  my boyfriend's dunkel was also really yummy even though i wasn't in the mood for a dark brew.  the atmosphere of this place was really chill.  but then again, we were there on a monday night.  bar area in the foyer as well as a gift shop, and a doorway leads to the main dining hall.  picnic-table-style seating from what i could see.
0	rj7qPSbE9766q6FYM0LVA	While we have never had the sushi at this restaurant, we love the Tappan.  We always get the best service and attention there, the ladies seem to love entertaining.  We have a 4 year old son, and they take him to the kitchen and give him icecream, pretty much cater to him while we enjoy our food.  We were even served cold saki complimentary one night.  My husband went there to get gift certificates for our friends for Christmas, they gave him samples of new items while he waited.  We really enjoy going and have a large group scheduled to go on Valentines Day!
0	C0c7oohZnZHKLWBgQnPe9w	Went here jonesing for tom yum on a cold winter day between Christmas and New Years. It was quite disappointing. I chose the seafood Tom Yum on the specials list (chalkboard). The broth was good but the seafood was awful. The shrimp were rubbery and over-cooked, the mussels came from a can, the bits of octopus were tough and tasteless, the little bits of veg in the soup hardly worth the effort to pick up with chopsticks. Makmak means "a lot", so I was told. My experience there was not.
0	P9sZVqxmGanBCZkgvFCyQ	If asked to described this place i would call it 'Americanized Chinese' but in a good way.   For one the two servers I had interaction with didn't have thick accents and when asked for their opinion on certain dishes they actually gave HONEST OPINIONS.  For example, i noticed there were Curry Puffs on the menu, i asked her if they were Singaporean style (used to work for Singaporean people and zomg their curry puffs were bomb) and said she had no idea what i was talking about, the curry puff they sold were pork filled dumplings in a barely noticeable curry sauce. WOW what an honest response!!  i decided to order the most expensive of the Wok Tossed Noodles (wow they didnt call it fried or stir fried) which was the Seafood Chow Fun. She asked if i wanted it wet or dry. all my life i was NEVER asked if i wanted my chow fun wet or dry. Went with wet because never had wet before.  my baggie came and i took it to work and opened up the bag. They gave me rice which i thought was weird, i ordered noodles why would i want rice? anyway the serving size was HUGE and tasted like what you would expect Chow Fun to taste like.   The most noticeable thing about the Chow Fun is that i got full off the seafood and veggies and at the end had a box full of sauce and noodles.  Overall good experience and i'll come back for lunch specials on days i work.
0	VjF8vW9EQyeWM6rdscwZw	My bf and I wandered off to this restaurant at the Mirage while we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive in LV.  I ordered the mini kobe chilli cheese dogs while the bf ordered the kobe burger and the spiced hand cut fries.  All were very good.
0	LlEB7n3Xm7esTN7kCxQ5A	Yelp to the rescue, once again!!  This place is an AWESOME off-the-strip find.  High quality, delicious food for really reasonable (almost cheap) prices.  We went in the afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, so we had excellent service.  It's in a strip mall, but nicely decorated in the standard blue and white Greek style.  A huge menu, lots of options and you get sides with most of the dishes (a plus for me).  I had the flatbread sandwich with veggies, feta, and tzatziki, and my pal had the gyros and fries.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  I wish we had a Greek place this cheap and good in LA!
0	Z48iVG9bnDE2kBtn5uug	No freezers, no can openers, or microwaves- this is probably my favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant. I've had the tacos (fish tacos are good), the fajitas (the chicken fajitas are very good), and a few of the burritos, but my favorite menu item is the Diablo Shrimp Burrito- shrimp, black beans, rice, jack cheese and spicy sauce. I got my husband hooked on it, except he has the sauce on the side.  I was curious about the langostino lobster burrito so I got it this past weekend. It was not good; too much rice, I mean, overstuffed with rice. I don't like too much rice in my burrito.  I'm giving high marks for the following: good service, fresh food, free drink refills, clean restaurant, and your choice of salsa (sad about discontinuing the mango salsa but the pineapple salsa is a nice alternative- a bit spicy but I like the kick). I almost forgot to mention that it's reasonable. Also available is covered outdoor seating. They do large orders- Party Packs. Do some shopping while you're in the area- Target, Buffalo Exchange, Albertson's, TJ Maxx, and Toys R Us.
0	dE5AxI69oB2N4xqSVLwa1A	We came here two nights in a row.  One night to eat, the next night to dance.   We sat at the bar and had excellent service!  All the bartenders were very friendly.  I had an excellent mojito and margarita.  Although the food was pricey, it was great.  I am from San Diego so I know what good Mexican food is supposed to taste like (not Tex-Mex people).  I had the chicken tacos, my friends had steak tacos and enchiladas.  However, the tacos were more like fajitas because they didn't come with the fixings, only a side of guacamole.  The chips and salsa were my absolute favorite!  We wanted to do some salsa dancing so we went back on Friday night.  Not much salsa but lots of latin pop, reaggeton, and rock en espanol.  Super fun vibe, Cesar, the bartender got on the bar and danced, and make sure you dress to impress (no tennis shoes).  I heard Saturdays go off!
0	UzRGD2uHWiHiMTyGfQaIdQ	I got a burrito bowl, and it was actually really fresh and tasty. Maybe the cilantro lime sauce? I thought it was expensive for what it was though -- a small (very small) bowl of basically vegetables for $7.   Now that I'm writing this, it probably deserves 3 stars (fast service)... but it's 99% the same as Qdoba, but on the other side of University. Just doesn't stand out.
0	aHnqfPadIwauvA464sOxA	All the way on the third floor of the new Ceasers Palace, is BOA steakhouse. This is yet another steakhouse transplanted from a tiny original version situated on Sunset Blvd at the Grafton Hotel. This restaurant in LA is such a hot spot, well it used to be anyway.  The decor of the LA store is super fab, intimate, and dark. BOA in Las Vegas attempts to capture the LA store but it is far larger and more open. I do like the food here though. Steaks come out hot in skillets almost and they can be carved for you table side. Sides are inventive, as many new steakhouses are now days. I will say, the view here is cool, and they have a fun patio that looks out to the strip.  The place is really far out of the way, I would recommend valet parking at the forum shops from the strip entrance and going up the elevator, but the walk out to the casino is for real fifteen minutes, don't wear your jimmy choo's.
0	bsQgnHunPpfqh0MygV4kw	This is stuff that is hard to get in SF.  On a business trip to Phoenix, I had the pleasure to try some truly good Southwest cooking.  For SF, it would be considered a true hole-in-the-wall.  Had the blackened cat fish and it was delicious.  Everyone in the party enjoyed their meal.  Nice local ambiance and yes there is smoking in the restaurant.  Would definitely go back.
0	A7ZgP5X2snLlfeesNr0wg	Great inside, staff was nice, bussers come very quickly, food was below average. We had the Sunday BBQ special, sounds great on the menu, but where is the flavor? Also had the bacon jalape\u00f1o Mac and cheese. Didn't go anything for us. The prices do not match the quality of the food.   The chefs may be famous, but the food doesn't show it. We were disappointed
0	qLn25feT2GmBz7L9zzGYEw	If your lookin for some gooood greasy pizza (and I usually am) this is the best place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, that is if you can find it. But, it's worth the search. This is not the place to go if you want to dine out, I think they have like one booth in this tiny place. Strictly pick up or delivery. Sandwiches and other pizza place items on the menu also.
0	BXjt4e3vnLdMc4UUPpiS0w	Two stars for the very high quality ingredients used on sandwiches. Went in with my daughter, she wanted a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles on it. Apparently at jimmy johns pickles are not allowed to touch the bread as I was told they won't put pickles on a sandwich and I just had to buy a side pickle. Seems like a very small step to take for customer service. My daughter spilled her drink on the table and I asked the girl at the counter for a towel. This also seemed to be a monumental task. Overall poor customer service, but still one of the best darn sandwiches I have ever had in my life.
0	aByXOmB0rl3ooHfQetEB5g	I'm from Chicago and I have to say Rosatis has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Rosatis when I'm in the mood for a softer crust and lots of gooey cheese. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!
0	vJHTAMUTdbM2UBFcqCVjkA	Meats seem to have very little flavor. I got the Italian sub cold and all I could taste was the ham and the overly sweet Italian dressing. I pulled the pepperoni and the salami off separately to taste them. The the pepperoni was completely without flavor and the salami wasn't far behind. Tried my wife's roast beef and it was the same. Almost no flavor from the meat. For the price I'd expect better quality and flavor.  I will come back however if I ever feel the need to eat flavorless meat. In the mean time I will just go to Jimmie Johns!
0	HtgaRxZqsOsvDQbg4ciEqw	You want a pizza, but you want it your way. Build your own! I suppose you can build a pizza any way you like at most any pizza places, but go to Pie Zanos Kitchen to choose from an extensive list of House Pizzas or create any combination from a sizable list of toppings (which include asparagus and sweet potato... no, really.)  I tend to work outside of the "norm" and will order the most bizarre items on the menu at any new place I try. I'm at a pizza place, so what do I order? The Cheeseburger Pizza. Instead of traditional sauce, the crust is topped with red sauce, mustard and A1 Brand Steak Sauce. Ever had pickles on a pizza? You will if you order this one. The crust is even covered in sesame seeds like a hamburger bun. Other House Pie varieties include the Bordertown, the Bo Diddley and the Volcano.   One feature that sets it apart from any other pizza place I've been is the offering of frittatas. Yes. Frittatas. I have yet to try one but in varieties similar to their different styles of pizza, they do look intriguing. Three varieties of sandwich are also available (Meatball, Pie-Talian and Veggie Medley). A full coffee and espresso bar are at your beck and call to compliment your meal or you can go with the standard sodas. Beer and wine are also available.  Pie Zanos Kitchen won the Phoenix Magazine "Best New Restaurant" Award for 2005 and has won the Phoenix New Times "Best of Phoenix" award. Next time you are wandering aimlessly around Town & Country Shopping Center, stop by and try a pizza the way you want it.
0	zbzm7L5E6w2qHXDXgyxd2Q	Nettes Eiscaf\u00e9 in der Innenstadt.    Die Sorten, die ich bisher getestet haben waren allesamt gut. Allerdings nicht so gut, als das ich daf\u00fcr 90c ausgeben w\u00fcrde. Das Preis-/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis ist meiner Ansicht nach nicht ausgewogen.    Die Kugeln selbst sind zwar gro\u00df, was bringt es aber, wenn man sich dann auf Grund der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe f\u00fcr eine Sorte entscheiden muss. Bei kleineren Kugeln k\u00f6nnte man zwei oder drei Sorten nehmen. Das ist hier f\u00fcr mich leider nicht m\u00f6glich. Das Geschmackserlebnis bleibt dann leider auf der Strecke, da man seine Waffel nur mit einem Geschmack herunterlutschen darf.    Au\u00dferdem ist die Eisdiele f\u00fcr mich mit Kindern faktisch nicht besuchbar. Welcher Knirps isst denn so viel Eis?? Da landet dann die letzte H\u00e4lfte auf dem Boden oder im M\u00fclleimer. Au\u00dferdem wollen auch die Kleinen lieber mehrere kleine Kugeln als einen Berg von einer Sorte.    Meiner Meinung nach wird hier zu sehr umsatzoptimiert, was zu Lasten des Angebotes und dem eigentlichen Kundenwunsch (mehrere Sorten probieren, kindgerechte Protionen,...) geht.    Fazit: Gutes Eis, aber f\u00fcr mich das falsche Angebot.
0	hkl3fn5LvOqtPYlC150YYQ	MMM. The Captial Grill, this is a place you know what to expect. Excellent steak and sides, some good appetizers and really good service.   On my last visit, We ordered the Filet au Poivre, cream spinach, au gratin potatoes, crab and lobster cakes, lobster bisque and creme brulee. Everything was prepared perfectly. The steaks were cooked spot on, the sides couldnt have been tastier. The peppercorns on the au poivre were so good, toasted well and just complement the filet nicely.   I definitely recomend this place if your looking for a nice upscale place for dinner with really good steaks.
0	vxmx6Ta3rIEgDAOMV5oPRQ	As a vegetarian, this restaurant is all wrong for me. However I came here for dinner w/ 4 others and didn't pay a dime of the bill so I was fine with it. The others (rest were non-vegetarians) seemed to enjoy their food and our waiter was excellent. The place was quite nice and we had a great view of the famous Bellagio watershow so I was entertained as well as enjoying the several side dishes/appetizers that I ordered (obviously couldn't order the steak) and washed it all down with decent wine.
0	vCIFaSD40EkTJ7guUMzGQ	They are really at  1 1/2...this is the 3rd incarnation of a restaurant at this location..I hope they make it. It may be that Breakfast & Lunch will keep them in business. Granted they have been open less than two weeks. Decided to give dinner a try. Upn entry was greeted by a hostess..they had 3..I have no clue why the place was almost empty. Was first seated in a booth w/ the a/c blowing full force..We moved ourselves. The wait person..I 'm glad they gave her a job...but very scattered..she approached us 3 times before she actually took our order. Orderd..full order of ribs & senior Pot roast..w/ Salad bar. Salad bar is ok....No sooner than we returned from the salad bar our entree's arrived. Watress commented oh that was quick...duh!!!!..Had not planned  eating my salad w/ my entree..Thought about sending it back..but having gotten a look at the people in the kitchen I thought better of it. Waitress was ok w/ refreshing our refreshments..but failed..w/ respect to bringing an order/side of veggies we ordered it arrived after we finished our meal. The ribs were the smallest ribs I've seen. They must get them from miget pigs.. The Pot Roast..humm..lets just say I made a bad choice..It consisted of canned meat that comes from Argentina, McCormicks brown gravy mix, instant mashed potatos, carrots/celery slighly warmed  from the salad bar...I left 1/2 of the meat on my plate..Their is an upside we did speak to the restaurant manager expressed our concerns, she took everything to heart and really listened and then compted the $30.00 meal. We did say that we would be back for breakfast at some point in the future. My suggestion is do them from breakfast or lunch...as far as dinner...they have a few bugs to work out.
0	TY5kNBKSuxClDQbVwEkfqA	this place is the bomb for a late night sesh. i've had tacos, plates and wet burritos. all great. i recommend getting adobada, since it's delicious and also, the only meat i've chosen so far. my friend got a carnitas quesadilla last time and she said it was really good, it looked like a greasy-good-time so i'll be trying that one soon. i usually eat here with two vegetarian friends and despite the bummer that there's only one thing on the menu they can order (vegi burrito) they really like the place. i will say that the beans here (refried only) aren't bad but i don't think they help the overall taste of whatever dish you get them in. i always enjoy eating outdoors and being sketched out by the other late night taco seekers who roll through. the price is right, the location is good and most importantly the food is grubbin'! solid spot.
0	2KUlaUF8NQ6f5H1Itb4Xw	This place is roughly 4mi from my house so it's not convenient, and it is right across the street from 24hr subway so I don't go here often enough when I'm over here for late night food, but I love their cheap tacos and their 99cent churros. Never had a problem as far as customer service goes, the staff is friendly unlike most McDonald's and Jack in the boxes. Would recommend somebody to go here for cheap mexican food, I actually prefer their cheap tacos to Taco Bell's 89cent tacos
0	FCCo21opJCygHo7MGumwiQ	If you're looking for a really good prime steak, I let you in on a little secret.  This Outback offers them at a very reasonable price.  For $39.95, I had a delicious New York Strip done to perfection.  Mind you, if you went to 9ine at the Palms, you'd probably  be paying about $95 for the same thing.  This is one of the only Outbacks that I know of that offers prime meat in addition to their regular fare.  The sides were good; the Caesar salad dressing was a might to salty for my taste, but other than that, dinner was great.  Hats of to my server Lex.    This place can be hard to find.  It's next to the M&M Store.  Just take the elevator to the 4th floor.  A window seat is a plus if you want to see the hotels and the Strip.
0	qfkhqFQJSSvMdxmTNitfwQ	If your expecting high quality Mexican food this place isn't it, but the food is decent. I would have given it three stars but the last time I ordered food here when I got home and opened my bag's our order was completely wrong.
0	cXPi6GfDvH6SuomOTybA	I can not understand how anyone with good taste could rate this place with 5 stars! The food is bland, and the place is messy. The only good thing about this eating establishment  is the view of the golf course and it's a good place to get a drink after a round of golf.
0	MKTzss5Y2uiQNTOykVZAA	I love sushi, AYCE more than anything! BUT I am 'that guy' who only eats cooked things...not much for fish, so if I am going to an AYCE sushi place the menu needs to be broad otherwise its a bunch of stuff I won't eat. Well, sushi zen rocks! Plently of rolls that you see everywhere and even more that they do in house. 'The Hulk' was AWESOME and their twist on the 'Japanese Lasagna' was great! (California roll with mozerella cheese and cream cheese melted on top) The *only* reason I gave it 4 and not 5 was that occasionally the rolls take longer than I would expect (not just the 'baked' rolls either), other than that this place is awesome. Friendly staff, remember who my wife, daughter and I are, never miss a refill on a drink, overall very nice!  We go at least once a month!
0	13EPtlYR0QgXWGI4mXPvIg	I'm giving this place two stars only because my burger actually tasted pretty good when it arrived.  The place had just been opened for a couple of days when I dined there, so hopefully they've sorted out some of their issues.  There was a very eggy smell to the whole place, and several flies kept buzzing around our table.  It was a hot day, but it usually is in the valley and I cannot remember ever eating in any restaurant with flies bothering me so much.  There were a couple of very friendly and attentive servers in there, but neither of them were mine.  It took way too long for my server to come and take my drink order.  When he finally did, he seemed a little lethargic and uncertain--maybe he was new to waiting tables and trying to figure otu what to do?   I ordered a burger and chips.  I ordered a kid's meal for my child--eggs, sausage, toast.  I noticed a hair on the sausage.  Yuck! I told the waiter and they replaced the meal, and the manager took it off the check--good practice, but not good enough to make me want to eat there again.   The whole experience just felt kind of icky.
0	SsuE1D9OVEy8JKxwdWBvw	Pas de quoi se petter les bretelles, c'est bon mais j'ai connu mieux. Un filet mignon bleu, pas vraiment bleu...disons saignant. Pour un mercredi pas trop plein, pas trop pr\u00e9sent les serveurs, si vous voulez du pain en extra, faut le demander. A voir les derniers commentaires, faut croire que les gens ne sortent pas beaucoup...
0	O9ENviiPdhoa22s2QqnsQ	Inventive twists on traditional Italian fare. Nothing too dramatic, but everything tastes very good and the atmosphere and service are very enjoyable as well. Full bar, lots of happy hour specials and live music/dancing on the weekends. Fun place!
0	hIhCfmMHBG6oTENc3Gv3g	This place is a hole in the wall...but aren't all the best ones??!?  When I lived in Vegas, this was the ONLY authentic Peruvian restaurant.  Their lomo saltado is delicious! I've had their jalea, aji de gallina, chaufa...almost all the items and their portions are generous. The alfajores and the lucuma ice cream are simply a little piece of heaven!
0	R6wTLL0oGaobVJO6IKJdA	4 cars in front of us.. Been waiting for 15 min.. now I don't blame the cooks or customer service as they were very courteous but the AWFUL management that understaff  this locations ... seriously some leads needs to be replace there..
0	4A810kcbEuJHlwFCEjwCA	Finally a pizza place in the SE valley that not only serves fantastic pizza, but GELATO! Personl faves include the chopped salad and Greek-style pizza. Red Brick Pizza also draws crowds for the TVs at each booth. Keep in mind this is a hot spot for local families, so if you're looking for a romantic date night it might not suit the bill.
0	3s4BErf1wcQ3vd2F2AvTPQ	I have to say, the food wasn't as impressive as I had hoped.  I had the Lobster Risotto and it was decent, but nothing really special I felt.  The flavors were a bit off and I didn't want to ask my dining companion about her meal fearing she was having a similar experience (and since I had chosen the place).  For the food, I'd say three stars.  Service was good though, and the dessert I had was great (Scharfenberger mousse).    Ambience was a bit loud, and not super cozy, but I may be a bit of a food snob since I'm so spoiled by some amazing food in the Bay Area so I just can't give this more than four stars.
0	DDHT6Im58p2fSCDjBw6aNw	After taking the dog to Comsmo dog park (for his first swim) we stopped here. Great patio. Plus, water bowls and treats for the canine were provided. I also enjoyed my Jalapeno Cheesburger!   This is great place to hang with Fido!
0	T8ZoobVng5HNS5LpV0toQ	This is one of those small town hole-in-the-wall rustic biker bar and redneck places that are so fun to visit.  I guess they mostly serve beer, because I asked for a Margarita and the bartender said she didn't know how to make one ... LOL.  I had a hamburger and it was excellent, as were the french fries.  I also had an order of cole slaw and it was some of the best I have tried - definitely home made.  There is also a pool table and lots of seating inside and out.
0	QJKYjhmpyc4W3geeNtSBA	The entire time I was there I kept thinking, "man I cannot wait to review this place".  Okay, let me set the stage. I was walking on my lunch hour and happened to notice a new restaurant in place of the old Chinese buffet place (that was not good) on Liberty. The sign read, "$7.99 lunch buffet". I thought why not try something new?  I could tell the did some general cleaning up of the building from it's previous tenants. I don't remember the hardwood being so nice or that the flooring was hardwood at all. It was simply decorated, but still decorated. Was it the best? No, but it worked.  At this moment it's only a buffet. Now here is where my issues with this place begin. This is not an Asian fusion restaurant. It's an Indian buffet with a few Chinese items mixed in. If I would have known that after I got in and sat down I probably would have left. I even Googled the word fusion to make sure I understood the meaning. I get that fusion means to blend (specifically cultures in this sense), but if it's Indian food you're slinging then just call it that.  The food I did try was decent. It bothered me that the food wasn't the hottest. There was decent size selection to choose from. I will say their chicken salad was amazing. I never eat anything mayonnaise based at buffets so you know I was struggling for food. Even the Chinese items had an Indian kick to them. This may be for you, but it definitely wasn't for me.  The servers were pleasant and the one waitress seemed very helpful to people who were obviously confused as to what they encountered. I didn't like how they don't give you a bill, but rather, you just walk to the front and pay. Seems kind of like poor business planning to me. I understand at this point you're only selling one food item, but how do you know what I had to drink? I think for the price it's worth it if that's what you're looking for, but I think this is a once is enough place for me.
0	eM6ya4OxvGuBNIKm8EYvAQ	This review is for Dinner.  Quick Review:  Food was good but the service was very very bad.   Details:  I have been to this place several times since its opening, service has been okay so far... but tonight it was disastrous. It took more than 10 minutes to take the order. Once order was made, food arrived in reasonable time. But after this no one cared to check our table for more than 30 minutes. The restaurant was not even busy. We finished our food and were kept waiting. Even the water was not refilled. I thought of ordering another dish and a dessert, but the lack of service made me decide against it.
0	LoEjTpNrl1UkgyS8utLWiw	Had a good late breakfast there, and it was good.  Went back for their walleye today and we were very disappointed. Bill was $36 for two walleye dinners and one diet coke.  We had been looking forward to the walleye being from Minnesota.  We tried.
0	MQIjgH1OwpRaFlFOqNDCA	Best pho I've found in Charlotte. I doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside I found it pleasant. Certainly not a fancy place, but the staff has always been attentive. They once overcharged me but I didn't notice. On my next visit, the manager made a point to welcome us back and delivered cash to our table in the amount we were overbilled. I was impressed with their integrity.
0	GXt9ZXh47CYUxn2rxWO9Q	I can't speak for the food.  We came here looking for a late night spot for a couple drinks.  Service was good.  So good we thought maybe the waiter was new because he checked on us so much.  I like the atmosphere, very lodge like.  I didn't feel like I was in the middle of  Summerlin Strip mall.  The menu was more extensive then I expected so I look forward to coming back to try the food.
0	6Zkj0w5aYmG2CzjhnphDtA	i would rate the food here at five stars, some of the best thai food i've ever had.  the problems are the atmosphere of the place. run down strip mall space with lime green and pink interior decoration from what i remember best left in the 80s.  as another reviewer said, they don't screw around with spice. if you ask for it very spicey you better watch yourself.
0	wD1pfFE9VnRid77Vky4CVQ	This is my favorite Indian restaurant ANYWHERE.   Last summer I was in the Pittsburgh area visiting a friend of mine that is from India. He took me to what he said was the best and most authentic Indian food in the country. Udupi is better!!  The environment leaves much to be desired,  but the food is amazing. A must have is the Paper Dosai Masala. It's a HUGE crispy crepe that has a filling (the masala has a potato filling) and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in. The presentation is as wonderful as the flavor. As evidence, the last time I ordered it, the tables on either side of us asked what it was!  The pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner. I have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so I'm not sure how it compares.   All in all, if you're looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!
0	xolKbgMfwWO3RbBbI2SSQ	This place is diabolically good.   Ate there last night before a long drive home to LA.   I have been craving their combo pan roast ever since, and I didn't even order that, I had the amazing jambalaya. My wife had the combo and I snuck the leftovers for lunch.   It's at the Palace Station and worth the trip. Go and wait.
0	1ANx8bhujH3S7TZPk5VwA	Great restaurant/food and everytime I eat here I get wonderful service.  Proves to not ever judge a book by it's cover. (That's why it's missing a star)  Great prices, especially the lunch menu.  I only like two Thai restaurants in Vegas and this is one of them! =)
0	gjmKKofH5SI6yDkYflJbjA	Wings here are great different kinds can get them naked or breaded. Pizza is really good to. If you like a thicker softer crust pizza you will love here. Personally I gotta be in the mood for this kind of pizza since I usually like a thinner crispy crust, but it is very good here as well. Have had a couple different sandwiches as well. Everything seems pretty fresh no complaints.
0	GTLuSEyRcZuxPXLKuAjxg	Should have believed the old but correct Yelp reviews.    Yes this is a Filibertos but it is literally inside the gas station market.  They had specials listed on the board by the cash register and I pointed to the Green Chili Burrito special.  I paid and stepped aside then saw the drink included in the ad and inquired.  The cashier said I needed to order the special to get the drink and the burrito in that special is much smaller.   I asked to change to the special and he responded that it was different and not possible, probably since the order was already being worked.   Oh well...  For my $4.80 it was finely chopped meat, green sauce and flour tortilla
0	zfv5R8WLa9e8ehDucfvMSg	Just went to Taste for lunch.  Well we will get this out of the way first:  the food is good and fresh.  Everything in there is shiny new and clean and sleek.  However, after getting the soup and sandwich combo with a drink, I am STILL HUNGRY.  And I paid over ten bucks!  The sandwich is a half in the combo - which means MINI, we are talking three bites.  Those three bites were good, however for $5.99 today at Jersey Mikes I would have had a huge sandwich AND chips AND a drink.  So - overall I think they should have toned down the chic-ness and tried to price their food better!
0	IuCFL4ezZCttUC7Tnk6bw	For standard breakfast food this is just ok.  The problem is there is not a whole lot around the Nugget to get breakfast.  If you stick to the basics it will be average.  The service for us the morning we ate here was very slow.
0	3H1ISkoJsh8SmWrHuhA	Not a fan of slow service and decent food.  I think the Blue Coyote refers to my mood and my belly hollowing and being hungry.  They ran out of a product and they had to switch it up which is not a big deal.  They made it work and that's what I appreciate.  We ordered the Drums of Heaven which I heard was really good.  They didn't have the right Chicken but substituted with another.  I thought it was pretty good since the brown sauce is usually really salty, but this one wasn't.   My sister and I each ordered a burger.  Mines was well done, real.... well.  It was somewhat dry in the middle plus I didn't care too much for the condiments.  I actually had to add ketchup, which I generally don't when ordering a hamburgers.  I would say the fries were my favorite.  Steak potato fries are yummy, but my I'm sure my love handles are screaming at me!  The ambience was pretty strange.  It had that truck stop cafe feel with some modern pop.  The Sushi bar really made a difference to the feel, but it was really awkwardly placed.  I didn't think it really belonged and it should just branch out on it's own to attract more customers.  Blue Coyote Cafe doesn't really scream sushi to me.    The service like I said was slow, but I don't think I can blame our waitress.  She did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was really polite.  I think there was confusion on who was supposed to serve us in the beginning and with the missing ingredient; really slowed the serving of the food.  - Enjoy!
0	aCT6GxaF5nTvoySB08AXNw	I personally dont like steam table food. But this franchise Chinese restaurant is not bad at all. most of the time, the food is fresh. And their restroom is always clean as well as the dining area. I think they have a pretty good management. My favorite food here is Kungpao Chicken. I like it with their chili sauce.
0	2sXLgoZASTPnpmCBXZSKA	I woke up hungover and was craving chicken tenders..the tenders were hand breaded and fried in front of me.  The fries were also dropped on the spot so everything was fresh.  Overall I was unimpressed, the breading on the chicken tenders didn't really stick to the chicken very well and the fries were pretty crunchy.  The flavor was just not there either, pretty bland. $15 for 3 tenders fries and a mug root beer, should have just put it all on black.
0	5ZZOSPctdh86QyXPrG8Q	I come here often early in the morning on my way to work. I sure wish there was another one that wasn't so far out-of-the-way. The morning manager is just not friendly. As many times as I have been in there she never smiles, never remembers my name, and seems that she is just extremely unhappy. It is also often dirty.  The bagels are good but the environment and atmosphere is unpleasant.  Go to a different location if possible!
0	U0UbJmnQSd72nGeZ9rLRFQ	I think Seoul Jung, which was the restaurant I believe was here was two restaurants ago, had the best food.   For Seoul Korean Grill, they've updated the place so it looks modern and have gotten rid of the mediocre sushi because Americanized sushi really doesn't have a place in Korean food.    I took a friend and her two kids to introduce them to Korean BBQ.  We ordered the marinated ribs and chadol (brisket).   We also ordered the pancakes and seafood soondoobu soup.    The side dishes weren't very good, no one touched theirs after tasting them.    The chadol was pretty bland, but that's always a hit and miss wherever, unless you're in LA and everyone really does use Angus beef.    The marinated ribs were supposed to be my savior but they were overly marinated in what tasted honestly like beef jerky marinade.  The used so much tenderizer, usually pear juice, that the meat lost all sense of what natural beef is supposed to feel like in your mouth.  They all felt like moist teriyaki beef jerky in your mouth.  Also, the grill doesn't get hot enough to char the meat or the marinate.  Therefore the grilled flavor is missing; which I think is an important piece.  Another important piece missing from the table were the lettuce.  Nothing to wrap the meat in before popping them in your mouth.  They were also missing the shredded green onion "salad" that usually accompany Korean BBQ.  You add it with the meat, ssam jang, and rice into your lettuce before trying to stuff it all down your throat.    It's all very overpriced, so if you're feeling like mediocre Korean food in a nice, clean, modern atmosphere....  Seoul Korean Grill is for you!
0	yfWxLZEE8gGO2caVqZtw	We were really excited to try this place.  The crepe filling had great flavor but the actual crepe was very tough and chewy.  If you have ever had a good crepe you will not be at all impressed.  The waffle was just okay.  If it sticks around for a while I'm sure we'll hit it again to see if they have changed their batter.  Everything was fresh with good intentions but a commitment to one particular item means it has to be special.  It certainly was not special.    The decorating is a bit awkward and appears unfinished.   Our food runner was very pleasant though a bit nervous.  I was still hungry when I left.  More calories burned chewing than ingested.  Best of luck Crispy Crepe.
0	oFnng0rGAobte9FaL49bLw	Let me start by saying that I desperately wanted to like this place and give a positive review. DESPERATELY. I even feel a little bad about the review because the people were very nice, but when I review restaurants the FOOD comes first. The only time service overrides food in my ratings is when the service prevents me from getting any food. Anyways, continue for the actual review.  When I heard about this kart, I was extremely excited. I mean, BACON-WRAPPED HOT DOGS. How could that possibly go wrong? Apparently, there are a lot of ways.  I will start off with some of the things I liked about this place. First, the people working were very friendly, even if they had a hard time understanding what we were saying (didn't seem like their English was that great, i.e. when I asked where the tip jar was, they handed me a paper bag to put my soda in). They were generous enough to give us free drinks because we showed up right when they arrived and before they were set up, so we had to wait. Obviously, that was our fault and they didn't have to do that (this is why I went for the second star here) Second, the food is very low-priced. Third, they have Mexican Coke! You know, the good version of Coca-Cola? Unfortunately, none of these things were the reason that I wanted to eat here.  Now, for the things that I didn't like so much. First off, when the hell are these people around!?!? It took my 5 tries before I actually managed to head over while they were there. As far as I can tell, they will be there around 7PM if they are coming at all and tend to come on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday Nights, if at all. As for the food, the hot dog was far from exceptional. Yes, the hot dog was bacon-wrapped. No, the bacon was not good. The bacon was the thinnest-cut, soggiest piece of bacon I have ever had. I was hoping for a thicker-cut, cooked to a little crisp or char, but that was not the case. Also, the bacon had very little flavor, probably due to how thin and soggy it was. On top of that, the hot dog was OBLITERATED with mayonnaise. I had to spend some time trying to scoop off the mayonnaise before I could eat it. Also, the hot dog seemed like your standard, store-bought hot dog without any of the really good hot dog flavor. I also tried the quesadilla, but it wasn't anything special.It was just a slightly greasy quesadilla with a mexican cheese inside, but that's about it. Food-wise, there just wasn't anything special about the food here. They didn't add their own little bit of magic, or whatever you wanna call it that makes it unique. And that little something special is absolutely necessary to make yourself stand out, especially with something as generic as a hot dog and a quesadilla.  Maybe I just had my expectations set too high at the cue of Bacon-wrapped hot dogs, but i didn't find anything special here. I wish I could say otherwise about something as wondrous as a bacon-wrapped hot dog, but I can't. Anyways, if you want to try it, I won't stop you. But, don't be fooled by the appeal and the potential magic of the bacon-wrapped hot dog, because you will be disappointed. I will only recommend this Cart (which, by the way, has recently upgraded to a truck/van) if you want something cheap. However, you will need a lot of luck for this truck to actually be there when you want it.
0	hctiNljUTsC18LkO1ugzsQ	this was some of the worst chinese food i've ever had. everything i ordered was incredibly salty. the tofu was not cooked very well and the fried rice, aside from being too salty, was rather bland. plus they didn't throw in any spicy mustard.  on the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and the delivery was free and quick.  this place might be good in a pinch, but otherwise seek out better chinese options.
0	C1Q4h7uBMhqfUVC99zuFzg	Yeah back in the day I would have rated a 8. I have been going here since my parents were carring me in the restaurant. It used to be much smaller until they bought the bar next door and expanded. Then they opened another in mesa and now on bell rd. As many people know the bigger the restaurant gets the less it is like the mom n pop joins I LOVE. Also I used to go there many moons ago and eat the WONDERFUL chips and salsa and tuesday or saturday $0.99 margaritsa and walk out with a $5 dollar tab. Now you must order a combo plate or a min of 7or 8 bucks to qualify for the 99cents margarita. I usually stick with the happy hour $3 dollar margarita and chips n salsa.  Dont get me wrong I still eat here. :) Happy eating  Good eats here: chicken fajita burro quesadilla chimichanga fajita
0	YzhMGpF03cdk40lFhSEfrA	I was pleasantly surprised by this pizzeria, definitely not your typical greasy/tasteless Las Vegas pizza spot. Although the pizzeria doesn't quite approximate the pies of Venice and Northern Italy, they are certainly crispy, tasty, and clean. Toppings aren't the usual convoluted mess you find at CPK knock offs, just simple and delicious (e.g., good peppery salame, arugala, formaggio, etc). I've tried their salads as well, boring combinations and tasteless dressings - nothing to write home about. Also, pies are small and served individually much like you would find in Northern Italy; thus,  the pizzas are not pre-sliced (you either tear it with your hands or use a fork and knife, whatever floats your boat). You should definitely give it a try!!
0	ZQC7dSyAhWQcxDRiOZRkTA	We were trying to figure out where to spend my dad's birthday dinner, so we decided to give this place a try.  The hostess was not the most friendliest, but I just ignored her.  Once seated we ordered the pre-fixe menu for $28, which included a house wine.  That's a pretty excellent deal in Vegas!  We all ordered the caeser salad; the portion was big and was really good.  For the entree, we all got the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  It was cooked perfectly!  It was soo delicious.  Lastly, for dessert, there was a variety of sorbets.  It was really good also.  We all walked out holding our tummys cos there was soo much food.  I almost forgot...they start you off with a basket full of breads.  Oh yum!  The bread was warm right out of the oven...sooo good.  Our server was very friendly, but the service was a tad slow.  However, in europe, service tends to be slow, so I figured that was what they were trying to do.  Overall, I would return here again.  I did not feel it was as bad as some of the other reviews.
0	p46CCUOOtls5xvqwRT8w	We went here for dim sum on our way out of Vegas, thanks to the suggestion of lovely Yelper Jacquie C. There was quite a long wait on a Sunday afternoon, unless you were willing to sit in the smoking section (we weren't). When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person. Overall, great food, though the experience was lacking since we were so tired and hungry.
0	WEE21A3HOVfjVdDnE1gSA	We've been coming here for a few years now.  Not often but every once in a while.  When we first started coming, I thought the food was pretty awesome.  Since the, however, I feel like there's been a steady decline.  Today just kind of topped it.  The service was fine - nothing to complain about.  However, the chicken was so DRY!  And I saw a little bit of blood!  When we first came here we bought extra chicken for left overs.  Never did it again because although initially the chicken was yummy and juicy, the leftovers was dry and not good at all.  That's what our chicken tasted like today.  I was very disappointed.  Needless to say, we probably won't be coming back here.  That really sucks.
0	h11CnhYWROTWiqCFsxJUQ	Staff was very friendly, said hi when we walked in the door and were pretty quick on the service. However, I'm HIGHLY disappointed in their comp system with drinks. My friend played max bet video poker, put in 25 bucks they comped one beer. She asked for another drink and the waitress said..."what have you put in the machine?" my jaw dropped. Then she comes with a tab and charged her for the drink. SERIOUSLY?! Keep in mind she was still playing. She cashed out and we left. Never in my life am I going back to this place!
0	HzYC2Vo2EeoLl8SBxqH2w	We were absolutely starving so we decided to check out this place...wish we hadn't. The food was lackluster - not all that cheap and NO RITAS! I suppose I needed to look for the apostrophe but I was kind of hoping they would have a variety of margaritas...but alas Rita is just the name.  With my hopes dashed I was left to the food which wasn't anything I'd give a second thought to. The day we went there was no live music and no real ambiance to speak of.

0	rkIbArvUOW9cX2TlwBEMOA	I have been meaning to try sauce for awhile... Well I finally made it!  I did not try their pizza, I had the Prosciutto, Salami, Turkey, Red Onion, Tomato salad instead which was yummy.  It was the perfect amount of food, but if i was really hungry I don't think I would have left satisfied.  My lunch mate had one of their panini's which was all the ingredients of my salad minus the lettuce.  He seemed to really enjoy that too.  I would surely come back and try other things on the menu, their pizzas looked really good too.
0	JgQ5CzrWlldZczxyUPlnNg	We came here for Chinese New Year's Dinner with the whole family.  I wasn't too impressed with the food and my stomach told me that as well later on in the night. We had ordered half a suckling pig which was the best thing that was on the table. Everything else seemed overly greasy and even the shrimp fried rice had a funny taste.   Service is what you expect at a typical Chinese restaurant...or rather lack of service. My husband's family ended up buying some of the roast pork to go for dinner last night and it was delicious. Unfortunately, I would say try the roast pork, but other than that don't waste your time.
0	osrz6JNKTfAYKYnjiYUfRA	I've only eaten here once.  It was an interesting spot for the restaurant, hidden away among a facade that did not strike me as an Irish pub/restaurant.  However, once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.  It is very charming and almost makes me want to purchase a pint right there.  I do my best to stop the urge.  The seating is odd; we are taken off to another room that I must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.  As the band was showing up right as we were leaving, I could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.  I wasn't that hungry to begin with but one look down the menu had me ordering Beef Stew w/ Guiness.  I was thinking soup more than stew for some reason so when a huge bowl was served to me, I was taken aback.  Had I been hungrier, I would've eaten much more, but instead my companion was asking me if I was gonna eat that.  That was a first!  I didn't partake in the alcohol consumption here (saved my money for Casino Royale) but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.  The cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.    I'll be coming back, hopefully sooner than later.
0	v08hMi9kbZlTzjR3XeMOoA	Ok you guys... Took Sarie out for a little 5th of July lunch.  I was pretty hung this morning, so we thought some sausage and carbs would definitely do the trick. Found a groupon for this joint. It's in Mandalay place, nice location. (It's always fun to stare at Pete Rose sitting at an empty autograph table). At the podium we were quoted a ten minute wait, which was exactly how long it took. Seated at a crappy corner table, then I asked to move to a slightly less crappy corner table. Oh well. They have a very nice beer selection. Great microbrews including my favorite beer ever brewed, New Belgium's 'La Folie.' Try it if you dare: a sour brown ale aged in merlot casks. Very well babanced, perfect use of Brettanomyces and tannin. Whoooohooo. The people next to us had a gigantic pepperoni pizza on the table.  It looked alright, a little soggy for my taste. I also saw some spaghetti and red sauce dishes that appeared to be nothing spactacular. Sarie ordered a cup of coffee and we relaxed a minute. The menu looked good, we decided to share a 'panini'... We ordered the proscuitto and brie. "That sandwich is no longer on the menu" our server tells us. What are you talking about, I think to myself, it's printed right there, stupid. Obviously it's on the menu. How about saying something like 'Oh, i'm very sorry, we're out of that one. maybe you'd like the _____ instead.' But I said Ok, we'll take the meatball sub.   Big mistake.  First of all, it had very marginal flavor. The 'meatball' was more like a mushy sausage patty than a meatball. The red sauce was equally flavorless and I only knew it has cheese because I could see it. No taste there either.  AND it was certainly not a panini, which should be pressed and grilled. This was more like a toasted sandwich. Im sure Quiznos has a better one, anyway.  The garlic fries would have been wonderful if they were not served cold. 80 degrees is perfect for San Diego, not frenchies. I would have sent for some fresh ones, but our server might as well have been David Copperfield's sister, as good as she was at vanishing. We got the bill, and I was surprised to see that Sarie's cup of coffee cost about as much as a footlong meatball sub at Subway (which is where we should have gone in the first place). Started feeling sick on the way home (although that might've been due to last night's festivities, which included copious amounts of liquid courage and about 65 cubic yards of mentholated smoke). Oh, and the groupon isn't even good until tomorrow, so now I'll have to go back, although I really don't want to. But when I do, it'll be for 2 bottles of La Folie and some hot garlic fries. All in all, this was a terrible way to spend $20 and an hour of our time. Blah food, blah service, blah blah blah. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the great beer list and clean atmosphere. Thanks you guys. Always a pleasure telling you how it is.
0	wgzKWfldwKKPqH14NhOl1g	I myself had take-out so I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the table clothes, but I can tell you that the naan was certainly not the best in town. I'd have to say the naan was probably the weakest part of the meal and was slightly burnt.  The rest of the food was fine, but on par with most other Indian take-out. I'd order again, but mostly for the convenience.
0	bwHV3HZe79fDKttR0JZfng	had sunday breakfast.  waited quite a while to place our order and the place was not at full capacity.  other tables were getting their orders taken faster due to the server.  they said they are not part of egg works or egg and I which i find amazing, that there is absoltuely no afilliation at all?  hard to believ ethat one  wait time for eggs and pancakes 24 minutes .  nothing special in the environment, the service, the quality or the pricing.
0	LV5CjfTwbtVqFDMc5YolsA	Good, reliable Mexican food. I've been here 2x and both times were satisfying. It's conveniently located to the First Friday festivities... and you can guarantee yourself a healthy portion of food.  The grilled fish Ranchero style was perfectly cooked. Guacamole was good with just the right amount of onions. The margaritas were a little weak though so expect to drink a few before you get a buzz.  If you come on a First Friday, expect a crazy crowd and expect that your server may be in the weeds and therefore... not so attentive. Come any other night of the month and service should be just fine.  I like this place because the crowd... and the hot summer night I just walked out of and into this restaurant.... somehow reminds me of a night at Chuy's in Austin, TX.
0	6xrlQ8euS0MdMJfaznrLhQ	The food is always delicious. Basic Mexican fare- baked burritos and enchiladas. The bean dip is amaze balls. We come back for the food but the service is always sub par.  We eat here every 2 weeks and we either get the super slow non existent server or mr no personality that brings me an empty Tapatio bottle and insists they don't have Chalula even though I've had it there every other time.
0	KfXVlQfxvnyx8M3rT3FLyA	Impressive! I was invited here for a networking lunch a few months back. By mere appearance from the outsode, I didn't realize how big Maggiano's is. Once I entered I was greeted by friendly hostesses. The group I was meeting was upstairs in a large "ballroom." The atmosphere was open and decorated nicely.  The food was delicious! I ate so much of the multiple appetizers (calamari, bruchetta, fried zucchini, etc.) that I barely had room for the main courses. The cheesecake was a great way to top off the dining experience. I left one happy girl!  The service was great too! Very attentive, yet nondistracting. Being in the large room kept our event private and the noise level down. The rest of the restaurant seemed very busy.   If you are looking for a place to host your event (business party, reception, etc.) they do it well. I plan on returning here!
0	jDP4I3A4IPGICXyPpzg0Bg	I went to this chilis last night with an old friend for dinner... but I accidentally kind of ate dinner at Liberty Market before I went (oops....curse their delicious yet filling coffee and desserts!). So my friend and I just shared some chips and salsa and a chicken jalapeno quesadilla. So our waiter was on his first day and made some mistakes.... brought out the wrong type of quesadillas and didn't fill the water when he should of, but I don't fault him and he apologized profusely (too much... ha). The quesadillas just weren't good though. I go to the chili's by ASU a lot, and the food is generally fine, it is what it is, but it's convenient and good. The food last night was not good. The chicken tasted weird and half of the pieces were crispy and the other half were soggy....So a meh for this place.... I'd probably give it another shot if someone wanted to go here, maybe it was just an off night.
0	N0H4nIOUMtpulD6yeGp4A	Solid.  As previous yelper said, don't be fooled by exterior, the interior is clean and nicer than most vietnamese restaurants.  Unlike a previous yelper, the owner/waiter is nice and does give good service.  In fact, he gave us a free sample of this amazing dessert there...it was like a hard doughnut with sesame seeds on the outside and delicious but not too sweet mungbean and coconut paste on the inside.  Eat it hot!  I can never remember the names or numbers of food in vietnamese restaurants, but I had the noodles dish served cool with mint, carrots, sweet vinegar sauce, and meet and shrimp.  It was good and ample.  My boo had pho, but made with beef broth and had shrimp in it...It was fantastic...the flavors of this soup were complex, but all of the flavors melded well together.  Miss the jalepenos, but that's a nationa issue.  Price: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Food:  4 stars Atmosphere: 4 stars SOLID...this is the first vietnamese restaurant we've eaten at that we both said we'll come back to.
0	wwKGzQQYXone0QTbBlycgQ	Today, my parents and I had lunch at Yogi Grill. We shared a #26: Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Combo. It came with 2 pieces of California Roll, Small Salad with Citrus Dressing, and 3 pieces of tempura (shrimp, onion, and sweet potato). The Chicken Teriyaki was tender dark chicken with green scallion in gourmet sauce over white rice. It was yummy!
0	4IyVjEfdIq7Pd9XMKZhL7w	Cafe Belle Madeleine was recommended to me by a friend who was adamant that I should try the pastries. I started with a Goat Cheese Tomato Basil Quiche - Mmm! Delicious! The next day I tried a Tiramisu and it not only looked gorgeous, but tasted rich and decadent with just the right amount of rum (sometimes the rum element is missing and just not right). And on day three I tried the Strawberry Pistachio Mousse. WOW! This was my fav! Creamy (and I mean like Heavy Cream creamy) with a definite hint of pistachio, this was the best thing I've had here and the rest were all pretty awesome.  Cafe Belle Madeleine is a must try at the Paris Hotel. But beware, stay away from the stale Bagel Bites. BLeh!
0	wERDQ8vhwHhzlpvcoqa9fg	I love this place!  Located in a strip mall (like most places in Vegas!) but inside it's like a cozy, dim, romantic cave.  Great place to bring a date.  They are moving soon apparently, so hopefully the new location will be at least as good as the current one.  Great choice for vegetarians since there is a whole veggie section in the VERY extensive menu, with more options than the usual cheese enchiladas.  Spicy and good salsa.  Portions are huge so come hungry!  Before you even get your meal you get chips with salsa and bean dip, jalapenos and onions, and soup!  Great live music...you may get serenaded at your table.  The bar has a good selection of Mexican beers and tequilas too, as well as many flavored margaritas.
0	9t6I8NaXzW2FLk3jSheHA	Muchas gracias to Geetah and Hank for taking little 'ol out-of-towner me to Barcelona.  Given it being a Thursday, the place was packed.  Best way to describe this place is amazing Spanish decor on a large scale.  The outdoor patio is perfect for warm days/nights and the interior is typical of Scottsdale architecture: new, modern with airplane hanger height ceilings and furnished with beautiful furniture and warm tones.  Dare I say it?  It's actually better than places in S.F.  *sniff*  I expected country bumpkins (Sorry!  My first time in Phoenix.  Had to trudge over for work.) but found a Laguna Beach/Costa Mesa atmosphere (sans the ocean) in the middle of the desert.  The crowd's friendly, male-to-female ratio balanced and we even snagged some boxing tickets from a nice guy walking around.  Does it get any better than that?  I heard Brittany and Jess head to this place when they're in town...but you may/may not want to disclose that info.  The only drawback to the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene is the distance between one venue to the next.  Imagine yourself driving through the suburbs and going to expansive strip malls (p.c. version would be lifestyle complexes) for action.  Oh, and maybe too many golf shirts walking around late at night.  Go during happy hour for the best crowd.
0	3XY0pNnmiHmnpEDz8Q2VA	This place use to be great 12 months ago when it was under a different name and management group. Now it is just plain bad food. I ordered a polle asado burrito that was just plain old nasty. I feel bad giving this place 1 star so I'll give it 2 stars since a buddy of mine frequents this place. There are half a dozen better fast food Mex places with a 1 mile radius so don't even bother with this place.
0	CciBRdwPNnXpmyBD7BA	Pinkus McBride is a short walk from my apartamente, and they sell all one needs when needing to make a "quick stop."  They are superbly clean, look brand new, and have some of the most friendly employees around.    I love how close Pinkus is to my place, it truly is a convenience store for me, in every sense of the term.    For as long as I am part of this neighborhood Pinkus McBride will have my business.  And how cute is it that the owner named the place after his dog?!  Awwwww
0	k6h6rUFjweuABGtmm9uNeQ	There is nothing special about this place at all. They charge you $.75 for "fresh jalapenos" . First of all they aren't fresh, they are pickled.  Second they have a condiment table where u can get your own pickled jalapenos and easily throw them on your burger just like they did.  Now for their cheese. I will not eat a burger without cheese, but their cheese was so bad that I rather eat the burger plain. It tasted like watered down Kraft American cheese singles. The lettuce in the burger was limp, had no crunch, no flavor, it was really dark. It did not look appetizing at all.  The meat was ok but I think it was a little over done.  The only good thing I have to say about this meal was the fries.
0	KLgyCHzDgh92or0Ek3wZpw	Don't believe the hype! I waited months for this place to open here and tonight I finally got to go. I was so disappointed. The burgers were just boring. Nothing special, forgettable even as we were eating them. The truffle fries are nothing special either. I wish I had a time machine to go back in time and not go there. For a delicious burger I suggest Red Robin, or even McDonald's would be better. I didn't even finish my meal as it was that unappetizing. Much better to go down the way to Cheesecake Factory, I wish I had!
0	JKlWvS3QpZnWm2x0GlTQ	Local biz? Check. Friendly staff and family operated? Check. House recipes and product made in-house? Check. Quaint interior that isn't over the top? Check. Even an open kitchen so you can watch roll out your pizza dough fresh! There is a cooler out front with a gratuitous amount of pastries. One thing I thought was awesome was the beer cooler. Plenty of single bottles and 6packs! Also, they have to-go lasagna. Take and bake at home. How cool!  Rullo Di Pasta has the potential to be something great and I believe they can get there with a few small tweaks to their pizza and wings. Where I'm a huge fan of any local place that makes their own dough, a feat not easily accomplished, it does come with some difficulties in the kitchen. Also, I'm a firm believer in a well-done pizza crust.   We went for a half four cheese and half veggies. It smelled amazing, it looked amazing, but the first bite was tell-tale for need of improvement. It lacked that well-done flavor. It wasn't even really cooked fully, in fact. The veggies were still raw, the cheese didn't have time to meld together and the crust was still entirely too doughy. The simple fix? Just leave it in the oven longer! I firmly believe that this would have changed the landscape of the pie tenfold. I'd definitely order this again if it were cooked better. The flavors are there, but just needs a temperature boost.  The wings...sub par. Again, I think these could have been cooked longer as well. They were a little limp and lacked all of the crunchy bits on the exterior. Also, the bleu cheese was pretty weak. Not sure if they make in house or not though.   All in all, this place has a great story and I look forward to trying them again in the future. I think with those few small tweaks, they can be cranking out great pizzas and wings! Cheers!
0	RfdHBp8s1EMRjtT4RSUuvA	Went to Postrio for lunch on 3/4/07. I was actually trying to find Bouchon but got lost and was too hungry to continue on.   I had a pasta with Bolognese sauce. It was all right, but the flavor didn't blow me away. The pasta was cooked al dente and good, but without a good sauce, the dish didn't quite hit the spot. My friend had the skirt steak sandwich with balsamic glazed onions, watercress, and blue cheese aioli. He said it was the best skirt steak he's ever had. And though I'm not a meat eater, I also thought the skirt steak was exceptional - very tender. The fries that came with it were hot and lightly mixed with parsley and parmesan.   We sat in the courtyard and service was friendly and courteous.
0	cGDV7QHBsJ2gceKXaDKuA	I make around 4-5 trips to Vegas a year from LA. I have been to many of Las Vegas' newest and finest. This establishment falls very short.  After placing our drink order, our first waiter disappeared. The staff finally caught on, and our "new" waiter stepped in to finally take our order. To our surprise, this young waiter condescendingly insisted on explaining to us how tapas works so we "don't have any questions later."  Allow me to stress how underwhelming the food was once it finally arrived. What's even more laughable is the one dish the staff recommended was by far the most mediocre (lobster on a skewer that was overpowered by a slice of pineapple).   When it came to dessert, we came to a decision quite quickly. Once again, ignored by the staff for nearly 20 minutes we opted to take the check. When it comes to tapas, Julian Serrano was one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had. The absurdly rude and neglectful staff made this experience completely inexcusable.
0	yzUVEqo6gjSj6VWZPG01sw	It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't consider it good pizza. As a former Chicagoan, it is difficult to find a good pizza anywhere but home. I understand it is supposed to be New York style but the term is so dilluted that it means nothing anymore.  I will give them another shot.   Garlic knots were doughy and needed more cheese and garlic. Pizza crust was crunchy on the edge and super soggy in middle. Also pepperoni didn't seem cooked enough, althpugh not a health risk, as a pepperoni lover I lile mine crisp on the edges.
0	f0cf5oKoQXX3g3MKqMVqw	Had the choice between the pizza here or a $5 dollar one from a chain, decided to give Palermos a try. Wrong choice! The price to quality ratio was just completely off. You really do not get what you're paying for, but hey the kids loved it so what the hell. Will try it again, but will not stray away too far from the pizza. The first thing that I noticed was that the pizza was very greasy. Greasy pizza, which is no problem if combined with pizza that has flavor, but the flavor here was completely lacking and greasy pizza without the flavor is no good. I kept eating just to see if it would improve. It did not. Like I said, I will try it again, so don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.
0	nce8u1rJfgfEvCi4i67Xw	The problem with restaurants like this is when you have tried authentic Vietnamese food and there is a huge disparity in taste and quality. Sorry, but after trying their food twice, we will never come back again. It's a short drive to Pholicious or Old Glendale's Little Saigon, so we will just keep going to those two.
0	8BlU8bp6iDI3EtXVN5QZEQ	I was craving a salmon bagel a couple of weeks ago, so my hubs stopped here to get me one instead of driving all the way to Bruggers.  Well, not a lot of people order those from the Big Apple in Tega Cay.  The salmon was old and had a mealy texture.  It was a to-go order or I would hv most definitely requested a refund.  Wont be going back for that.  Maybe a plain bagel.
0	5x7ruQH9Mbsl1apM7554g	I really wanna come here when it's actually a bar.  I mean, yea, every time I come here it's a bar.  But I'd like to come for an actual bar activity.  I think it could be cool.    But it's a great lunch spot.  I really wish I didn't go to lunch alone because I'd love to make use of those board games.  And it just seems sad to play with the shuffle board by myself.    Today when eating lunch, 4 TV's in front of me were set to Espn2, Nascar, The movie Saw, and Teletubbies.  Well, first Barney ended - then it was Teletubbies.  On one of the many TV's in the other room I saw they also have some cooking show on which I wish I'd been in front of while eating.  Very theme appropriate.  I do love their full leg, fishnet lamp.  And some of their cheesy signage is fun.  But I'd love to hang out with friends in their little mini-living room on the raised platform with the big screen TV in the corner playing the "fireplace" video on constant loop.  Love that thing.  But - I go for lunch.  Their Philly is good, and their burgers are pretty decent for a bar.  Nothing amazing, but ok.  The place is nicer on the inside than I expected, but still felt very casual.  They definitely get bonus points for the popcorn machine behind the bar.  That plus those board games take this to a solid 4 star experience based on my lunch time experiences.
0	4PGQ9x2uApzSJUNftOikA	Went here off happy hour on a Saturday to watch some sports and grab dinner.    Food:  I tried the roasted garlic fries, which were amazing, and the flat bread which was okay.  The food prices were really reasonable and I can't wait to have the fries again.  Definitely something you will not want to eat if you're looking to pick someone up.  Staff:  I sat at the bar the bartender was friendly.  There were a lot of older guys around (50+ in terms of age), and you could tell that it was a hooters like setup where they'd hit on the skimpy outfitted waitress (which hey no complaints about that) and she'd play along.  I saw a comment about the girls gossiping and sitting around.  There was a table where all the waitresses were together, but this was due to it not being busy and a was also setup to greet anyone who walked in.  Prices  Food prices were reasonable, but beer was real pricey.  $6.75 for a 32oz miler light seems kind of ridiculous.  Yes it is off happy hour, but come on.    Overall:  I sat at the bar so I could watch the Olympics.  There were plenty of different tv's with all different sports which was great.  I also hope to sit outside next time since it seemed like a cool setup.  As I said food was good, waitresses nice to look at, and all in all a nice experience.
0	we3eGDMueXQsSCr0pEw	I had never been to Port of Subs before but it's really good. They serve big sandwiches with fresh and good quality ingredients. Their subs are a bit pricey though, so I wait until they have deals on their subs for a small discount. It's a nice convenient location
0	nTVIcWQEc4zd1ECimNB62g	This came to me as a recommendation and I was disappointed. The food was subpar and the presentation was even lower.  They did have a lot of lemonade choices. Well, two and some flavored water. I guess that is a plus.   Nothing to write home about in my humble opinion.
0	aLiItjAeHxCv0myr7FQmQ	Experience:  This is my Grandfather's favorite IHOP.  He eats at this spot at least 3-4 times a week. So, once in a while, when I can get up early enough, I like to join him.   Service:  Now, let's talk about why this is his favorite spot...that would be one particular waitress named Bianca. She knows my Grandfather by name and treats him like gold. She is half his age, but he would marry her, if she could.  She is very friendly and helpful by nature, so make sure you ask for her!  Food:  what can I say....it's IHOP.  I like the food here, and every time I have eaten here, the food has been hot and fresh.  I ordered the smoked sausage breakfast with over easy eggs and sourdough toast. I always ordered some roasted Serrano peppers on the side too. They are not for the faint at heart, but I love them!  Facility:  It's an IHOP.  LOL!  But this one is nice and clean.   Overall review:  I would probably give an IHOP a 3 star rating, but I'm giving an extra star because of Bianca.
0	GAol7nmykEdTEGt2iYoNw	Happy hour and reverse happy hour. My two favorite times of the day! Luckily Sierra Gold is there for me when I need it.  The pizzas are always a good choice. They're not fantastic, but they're cheap, which sells it for me.    I'm addicted to the Pretzel Bites and Pulled Pork Potato Skins.  It's my happy hour of choice when I'm trying to be frugal, but still feel like socializing.
0	iCBxItijlMRBIfBgWmqw	I was very excited to see what the new La Fonda location was like and what the food quality and the menu was going to be like, after the La fonda move from the Scottsdale location.  I used to go to the old location for many, many years, and loved it.   The new Baseline building location has been completely remodled and redecorated inside and out.  It looks great.  Right away, however,  I noticed a menu problem.  I used to order a burrito, alacarte and a taco or two.  The new menu has only burrito combination plates.  You cannot order a burrito ala carte.  A green chili burro will cost you $8.95, and come with beans and rice.  No other option is available.  I was told by our waiter that "They are trying to get away from the ala carte thing."  I was very disappointed.  When my "Build Your Own Combo" Lunch Menu order (burros are not offered with this option) came out, I was disappointed.  The shreadded beef taco meat was dry, tough and flavorless.  I could not even bite through it.  A server did offer to replace it with something else, but, I was starting to just want to get out of there, and count my losses.  The ground beef taco had no flavor, and the cheese portion put on both tacos was skimpy, at best.  The cheese enchilada was thin and skimpy.  The plate was very hot, and the beans and rice were OK.  It just is not the La Fonda I used to crave, and I doubt I will be back.  I might give it another chance, down the road a bit, to see if they improve.  This might be another case of a place that used to be good when they were small, but lose it when they expand to a huge new building.
0	wDQVkC4MO87dtqB569zDw	The New Buffalo Burger Is GROSS" Stopped by here with the coupon that offeres you a free buffalo burge when you purchase a Medium/Large Buffalo Burger meal and when i tell you that it's the worst i've ever had from Carl's Jr that would be an understatement! I usually never have a bad experience but then again Never say Never right? Skip this new burger for SURE
0	9NFtjjNpJ462wujVt5DlQ	I really like Mr. Lucky's.   The food is good, the service is fair, and as a local.. it's nearby where I live. I find the prices to be fairly reasonable.. and while the service is hit or miss.. I usually sit at the bar up front, by the kitchen line. I feel like it ensures that I get some attention. (though not always right away)   The thing is, it is @ the Hard Rock Hotel. I like that.. its 24 hours a day..and you have already heard about the $7.77 Steak and Shrimp deal. There is always the $9.99 all you can eat prime rib and salad and potatoes... all you can eat is the Prime Rib part.  I get the rehab breakfast, or seared tuna tacos every time. Go there, don't take it so seriously, do it .. like it.. love it.
0	NM6vo6F3HjcESVxCQYgtlw	probably the most affordable out of all the overpriced(although common on-the-strip) restaurants at Wynn and Encore.   Chowder Bread- it's a cafe so don't expect much. not bad but can be 2 star better. berry parfait- had this as a snack and supper for the next 3 days. granola wasn't that crunchy but everything still tasted perfect. this is the first time i had it and definitely is my 1 out of 1,000,000 tries.
0	J0VDA3o7MwuuWJf5TIvoYw	I have tried a few different pizza's here and recently Chad M suggested I try the meatballs and jalapeno. Seriously good! The secret to this place is to have a few toppings  instead of loaded to the hilt.  If you are not into customizing your 'Za than try the Brooklyn -  it's a favorite.
0	u4NCVJQnY265tztLIgeAQ	We were very underwhelmed with Rick's.  It's a cool setting, very nice hotel, mediocre food, and decent service.  Altogether, it's 2 stars.  We ate a late breakfast on a weekday.  There were only 2 other tables in the joint, and one of those was finishing up.  We still had to wait a bit for water at the beginning, although I will say refills got better as the meal went on.  I had the breakfast wrap, which was a wheat tortilla filled with eggs, ham, onions, a little crema, and cheese.  It was served with salsa, which had to come out of a jar from the store, and pico.  The pico was homemade and a nice blend of tomato, onion and cilantro.  No heat, but good flavor.  I ate all of it and only had one bite of the salsa, which I imagine comes from New York City.  This comes with a side of potatoes.  They thinly slice potatoes, season them with a few herbs, and fry them.  But, it seemed as though the oil was not hot enough.  Some potatoes were fried very well, others were limp and oily.  Also, all lacked seasoning, I didn't detect any salt or pepper, and potatoes need salt.  This dish, if executed, would be solid.  But, it wasn't, so they weren't great.  The wife had ham and eggs.  It's a huge meal, very large piece of ham with eggs, 2 pieces of toast, and the aforementioned potatoes.  This was what you would expect.  Nothing to write home about, just a large average breakfast.  The prices are a little high for what you are getting, but you are in the Westin and it's a nice setting.  We had to sit there for some time to get our bill, that was an annoying end to the meal.  My 2 star review is not based on the prices, it's based on the food and service.  We may return, but I think it'll be awhile.

This place is a lunch machine- They take your order fast (and accurate) have your food up and let you loose into the dining area. The prices are reasonable, the service is always friendly and the food is really good. I got the chicken salad sandwich on rye (yum) and their chicken chili. My client got the turkey sandwich and chicken soup and gave both high marks. Oh and I took home roast beef and broccoli cheese soup for the wife and she loved it. Definitely one of my favorite "meet you in the middle" places.
0	X9iZRwQ9VIdAh8y8hTPTVw	Located upstairs, and free Wifi available.    The ramen was average and the service was slow.  There were 2 servers for the entire restaurant.  The shrimp tempura was good, but the shrimp was the frozen kind which I think got us all sick and running to the bathroom later that night.    This was one of our first meals after arriving to Montreal because we were starving , in need of wifi and wanted something close to our Sheraton hotel.
0	Kb6ljt4HWStcSDPvnmg	A little pricey for what it is. Food wasn't bad tasting but it's the little things that get me. Serious lack of salsa for one. What they do have are in little tiny 1 ounce cups that you have to ask for, and when you do, they bring you one. Really? That's enough for maybe 2 bites. Don't skimp on the salsa!! A bottle of Tapitio on the table, ok not bad, but how about a few other options? I tried the empanada, there was a warning on the side: "Contents may have settled during shipping" There might have been 2 tablespoons of filling. Yes it was only 1.75 but still... The pastor burrito was huge, but it was mostly rice and beans. The few chunks of meat I did taste was ok. i can't forget the horrible music playing.  It has potential but I don't think I'll be back.

During winter afternoons it's very empty.  Who wants to walk all the way out there in the cold, right?  2.  Lots of places to plug in.  Sit by the wall and you'll find one.  3.  Two dollars for a coffee.  Dollar refills.  Coffee is standard imitation starbucks.    4.  Clean.  Bathroom is always impeccable.  I've been here a million times and I've NEVER found the bathroom dirty.  5.  WIFI is pretty reliable, but it can be slow at times.  Just ask the staff to reset it if you can't get on.  Best to ask around and be able to say a bunch of people can't get on.  Um, anything else?  This place is a great study spot.
0	PhkjakL3y1qmTdHn6k2oYg	YAY!  Made a return trip since my first experience was just so good.  Was really hoping that my first experience was not idiosyncratic.    Wonton soup Steamed dumplings with tamarind sauce Thai-me-up wings Basil leaves with beef {piquancy 6/10} Green curry with beef {piquancy 8/10} Spicy fried rice with chicken  I must say, I still enjoyed the wonton soup.  It still had the aromatic notes about it and I enjoyed the flavor.  The steamed dumplings were much better this time; in fact, I rather enjoyed them.  They were no longer rubbery and everything that was so out of balance the first time was finally in balance -- even with the tamarind sauce.  I upped my entree to an 8/10 on the piquancy since last time it was lacking that flavor that I enjoy.  I was banned from trying anyone elses food since they were not willing to try mine.  I was told by my friends that their food was good.  The only note of discontent I heard was that my friend that ordered the Basil Leaf with Beef would order the chicken in the future since it had better flavor.  My green curry was wonderful.  All of the spices melded together and I felt that the beef was perfect due to the strength of the sauce.  I can already crave that sauce again and will most definitely be returning.
0	sq2KSshWf5CgjB3yzMJshA	Tasty tasty bbq.  Fall off the bone smoked chicken is my favorite here.  Good cowbro beans and collard greens.  I like the bbq sauce they use here too- tangy, not overly sweet, with a little bit of heat.  We usually split the chicken and ribs combo.  For $17.99, you get a sizeable plate of bbq chicken, ribs, and 2 sides.
0	53RsaOCA7gNn85YRxv4npA	I had an hour to kill and thought I would grab a bite and wish I would have saved the caloric intake for something else,  the pizza was really greasy and soggy with a very plain and basic crust.  There was no flavor or tender crunch that I recognize with their style of pie, I'm hoping this was an off day as it is a new location but they need to work on it quick.
0	1qe02sjhUuiCdE861GW37g	The first time we went 2 years ago we went for dinner. I love that they have Shiner Bock - not a lot of places do.  I had the pulled pork which is my sandwich of choice that I base places on and the BBQ sauce was amazing - I bought a bottle before we left.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and loved it also.    The second time we went last year, we showed up when they opened at 11am, grabbed a barstool, and left at 5pm.  We had met up with friends of mine from high school that I hadn't seen since high school (16 years!).  The bartenders were awesome for the whole 6 hours, and as much as I loathe domestic brews, the 2 for 1 specials allowed us to have a low tab and be sufficiently drunk.  I love all the free shots when they play the signature song, too!  I still had plenty of Shiner Bocks and a few mixed drinks and a few shots of Jager along with a plate of nachos and we left there with a bill of $45.  I can't wait til the next time we're in Vegas to spend some more time there.  It's very convenient to get to from the monorail, but pretty far back in Harrah's off the strip.  Still worth the effort.
0	mgUbV4O2hq1fakvgaBYYWg	I don't get the popularity of this place. Food is blah. Beer is okay but nothing to write home about or make one actually think about Ireland. It gets 2 stars because it smells better than the Saloon.
0	N83r6MKAv0KtUD02sK1pMg	Two for one drinks during happy hour is the best thing about this place. Good place to view sporting events. They get a little loud, but it's still a good place to enjoy a game. Good bar food specials too during games.
0	jBOneLMSKN3XrvOBBWDEPQ	I ordered last week from Kam Wing. The menu contained very few vegetarian options and the only tofu plate offered used fish sauce. The tofu meal I tasted was alright - neither too bad nor too good, but for the price you will definitely find better Asian cuisine in Montr\u00e9al. An "okay" mark if you are looking for something average and are in the neighbourhood.
0	5sA4BZo8apadkgrpkJCBw	Good start and has potential, BUT I was only halfway through my soup when the waitress walked up and took it away. It was my main course. When she came back and I asked told what happened she went back to the kitchen to get me more and brought me a bowl of broth that looked like watered down salsa. My original soup had chicken, rice, and avocado. She charged me for it and I left hungry. Hopefully the place gets it's act together because the soup that I ate was quite good.
0	7OwtJQU8Tk6zEFdkm4Whyw	Layers, O let me recount the times.....back when I lived in Las Vegas, they shared the same strip mall space next to TJ's and Layers was a weekend ritual for me. A jewel in the sea of strip malls and Starbucks. While not a great place for coffee (seriously, Las Vegas was always lacking in this department!), the desserts were good - from flourless orange almond spice cakes/tortes to rich chocolate decadence (check out their small molten chocolate ganache cakes...mmmmmm). And....i'm not a dessert person, so kudos to the bakery! BTW, on Saturdays, they always had something special on the menu - like applewood cheddar bacon scones.   Anyways, I'm glad to hear that they're moving to a new location. One serious complaint was the lack of space - and now it seems like they're keen on correcting that. I can't wait to try them out again at their new location!
0	ZkZPx3ueGDtu99k27ERoLg	I just wasn't a fan.  $30 for breakfast for two adults and one toddler is a little crazy to me.  I asked for a kids menu and the waitress told me they didn't have one for the kiddos to draw on but that they did have kid items. She then recited to me what they had available. However, I am a consumer that likes to make wise choices. I like to see what I am ordering, how much it is going to cost me, how many of what I am getting, etc. I think you get the point. Needless to say, I made a blind purchase so when the bill came and my son's pancakes cost more than the breakfast I purchased for myself, I was a little dumbfounded.  I ordered the breakfast off of the light fare and it only cost me $3.99. This alone was a steal for toast, eggs, bacon and hash browns.   But my one cup of coffee cost me almost $3.00, go figure.  So wherever I got a deal at, I got robbed on something else.   My son's pancakes were $6.00 for 3 pancakes. I just don't get it.   The food was decent I should say. I don't know I expected better prices, I guess. And I didn't like the booster chairs in the booth. When I asked for a high chair they told me they couldn't put a highchair at the booths.   Yes, the food was decent. But it wasn't a family friendly place and to me that is very important. And really, $6.00 for 3 kid pancakes just rubs me the wrong way.
0	TMHCAfzIbUOFriFYqo1yQ	Went with a friend last night and picked Tatum's because it was walking distance from her condo and we wanted a golf course view.  Sat on the patio and it was nice.  Ordered the french onion soup - bland, and the stuffed mushrooms which were good.   For our meal we ordered the prime rib sandwhich and the philly sandwich - one with tater tots and the other with cajun fries.  We send both our dishes back TWICE because the sandwiches were cold.  It was obvious that they just tried to microwave them because the meat came back very tough and leathery:-(  The waitress had the executive chef take care of it, in which when they came back the plates were hot as well as the food.  Both meals were just ok..I have had better sandwiches at Portillo's.  Fries and tots were nothing special - pretty sure the tots are frozen ones that they just microwave - hence the amount of ketchup needed to eat them.  Waitress was very nice through all of this.  My friend works at a restaurant and I grew up in the grocery and restaurant business - were we too critical?  No, Tatum's needs to work on their menu and their cooking.  Glad we did not order the pricey entrees.
0	mca0dLmGSBUcFUuEO5qFDA	We went to this place for dinner.  It was well lit.  It is supposed to be kid unfriendly but my rambunctious kids were so well behaved, it was like they weren't even there.  Either it was the long drive or the peacful atmosphere in the restaurant.  Here's what we ordered:   For the kids:  The chef made a special accomodation for the kids by adding chicken to the noodles.  Their noodles are normally vegetarian.  Also they weren't like the ramen noodles you see in Chinese restaurants.  Kids scarfed it up.  For us:    Combo appetizer platter:  Nothing grand about it.  Standard Lamb with ginger, onion basil and chili:  WOW.  Very unique! Singapore style prawns:  Very nice Eggplant and tofu:  This was very nice too!  The waiter was very cordial and accomodating too.    We'll definately go back.
0	92vmITqX2TfjUguDfGX7jA	Say what you want about service- which I am usually very critical of.. but I like this location, the prices, and the food. A lot of it reminds me of the dirty parts of detroit, but with better quality food. The seafood fundido is my favorite dish, a little spicy and creamy. The complimentary bean dip and salsa with chips is nice too. Get a giant margarita during happy hour if you like tequila. I have never had bad service here, in fact that is what has made me come back a few times already. Not to mention, no one eats in the Arizona Mills mall because they think it is "ghetto" so it is not too busy. I prefer going here on a saturday afternoon or a monday evening myself. I will bring my friend after we hit up some of the local shops in the mall. The fried ice cream is good for dessert too. For being a chain, this place is one of my favorites, besides Serrano's.
0	hZcf9YCYAzAmCDu8hV9zQ	Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday. Chose this place over Buffalo Wild Wings. BIG MISTAKE. Food was horrible! Tuesday's they have .35 cent wings ( didn't know this until we say down and looked at the menu ) but the wings were super greasy, small, no meat, and tasted very bland. I hate restaurants that promote specials like its a deal and all the do is take away from the quality. Very disappointed and will never go here again. Should have stuck with what I know best, Buffalo Wild Wings!
0	129gEdKGYy0D83GpYQI6A	Pizza is ok, but not worth the price. We tried both the small omnivore pizza and the Pima pizza.  I thought the pizza crust was grainy and a little mushy for my taste. Also,Pizza did not have enough sauce, in my opinion.  I liked the omnivore over the Pima which tasted like store bought pizza.  Not too excited about the store design either since it does not allow for inside sitting.  Outside sitting is ok in the winter but the other half of the year, the arizona summer's are not inviting to outside sitting. To me this seems like a critical flaw for this location.
0	2ywg8xs8XHslzjMIky2lw	I go here all the time.  Its appeal is in its artistic and comfy decor (including art everywhere), its excellent coffee and tea, its vegan pastries, and its overall ambiance that could be used as a place to study or meet up with a small group of friends. The only thing I think could be better here is the lighting - at night it gets hard to see the words on my pages and I'm sure I would go blind in a year if I always read in that light!  Also - I would love if they had food there - but I would never leave!
0	PGA9UQScLR6Q0LQMbBsbg	The fish fry, for the price, is the best in Madison - and I mean it. 3 big pieces of walleye with a potato side and soup or salad m8? Sign me up. Don't go between 5 and 7:30 on Friday   Otherwise it is a neighborhood bar. Try the Scotch ale.
0	EbdnX5pbiVY36NzqpJIkw	I love me some In N Out Burger!!!!  This is a must every time I hit the west coast because we lack this food chain in Illinois.  You can't go wrong with this place...it's simple, burgers, fries, drinks, & shakes.  I absolutely LOVE the fries from this place!!!  Skip McDonalds and those other food chains... this is higher quality fast food that you won't regret.  Oh, if you're skipping out on the carbs/bread - you can get your burger wrapped in lettuce tooo!
0	MakXBTGMlSXJuvNWSLrGQ	I have never walked out of a restaurant prior to ordering, but there's a first time for everything.    It must been a busy night, because the service was painfully slow. We initially walked in & made our way to a table. It was difficult to navigate around with the oddly placed couch area. We sat down at a table towards the back of the room, and couldn't help but notice a foul smell... low and behold we were near the bathrooms! So, we saw another table leave and we quickly swarmed in on a new location by the bar.   After being ignored for nearly 10 minutes, menus were finally dropped and the server raved about how some Arizona winery just changed the world. I wasn't impressed, I really wanted to order... something! To my disarray she left the table and went back to the bar, without taking our drink order?!?  Oh well, on to other bookmarks.
0	ZldJkjsURJ2UxJFxtiIIQ	I dined at this location a couple times while it was Cafe del Sol (delish!), but recently decided to meet a friend here for lunch and give Fuego a whirl.    The place was almost empty, maybe 2 or 3 parties of two. Our server was nice, a little slow, but nice. I ordered the fish tacos and mi amiga ordered the empanada.   The food was great. The tacos were marvelous. Flavorful and succulent. Mmm. Unfortunately, I ate everything on my plate and didn't feel completely satisfied. For a $10 lunch plate I was a little bummed. Oh well.   Have yet to try dinner, but the husband and I have a couple of VIP cards for entrees so we'll have to hit it up soon.
0	AmSCdGp4v0xXRC0BHmdf2g	I've been craving hot pot but no place was coming to mind. After reading the reviews here, I decided to take a trip down to this little hole in the wall. Sadly, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps it's because I've been spoiled by So Cal hot pot and authentic lamb skewers when I visited China that nothing was memorable or impressive about this place. I'll give credit for the nice service and the lemon in my water. The mini pot looked like imitation boiling point but the flavor is not as good. The lamb skewers were overcooked and chewy. Maybe I'll give it another chance one day but for the time being, I'll get my hot pot fix from LA instead of here until I find a great one.
0	ttv7S3bBo1JBMRWX2qTEKg	So it's no Lawrys, for for less than $20 for prime rib, you can't go wrong.  I heard about this place from my cousin, and we all decided to try it.  It's off the strip, at The Orleans, but it's pretty good for it's price.  If you don't mind driving,  I'd reccomend it to people, and I'd probably go there again.  The service was very good and the wait staff was very attentive.
0	dOJPsfa6NThJYAhJNRfwQ	Weather & Coffee is a wonderful little coffeeshop at the corner of Bell Rd. + Piestawa Fwy.  The place is artfully designed and has a weather theme (it's owned by a former tv weatherman).  The staff is always very friendly and service is fast!  I'm not much of a coffee drinker but they have a nice selection of delicious, freshly made teas.  Their muffins and bagels are darn good too.    I would choose an independently-owned shop like this over Starbucks any day.  Edit - CLOSED
0	NKC0zNIYEyyOkvbRJSCIcA	I have honestly had better food at the Harris Teeter Asian bar! Sushi selection is limited  at best with half of the food having zero  Only good part of the meal was that they had local Noda brew. I am all about supporting the local places but in this case I can' t put my recommendation behind them. Would think with being new they would really try to make a name for themselves in the Charlotte food scene but they have failed miserably!  The space has been beautifully remodeled for the next restaurant to take their place!
0	67d6UMPDZq37X6dijsYNA	I know this is just a fast food place but you still have to hold your eating establishments to higher standards. More times than not I find the food to take  a while to get and the play area is DIRTY!
0	tLRMrBb7ZMscCjcAzMxpQ	I think this restaurant is overpriced and the food I had was ok. I ordered the Ceviche de pescado and Anticucho. The ceviche is big enough to share and they should probably have a smaller (less expensive) version on the menu. The meat portion of the Anticucho was just right, but the salad was not really necessary.  The flavours on the Ceviche were pretty good. It was well cooked, and the corn was really good. The leche de tigre was flavourful too.   I was a little dissapointed with the Anticucho and expected a stronger marinade flavour.  I also had the Chicha Morada which tasted like it was made with Maiz Morado, but was too watered down and was missing some of the fruit flavours that come along with Chicha. I noticed they don't sell Inca-Kola by the can, just bottle.  The chips and cancha on the table instead of bread was really nice.  This is a nice restaurant but way overpriced for the food it serves. If they can get the portion sizes and prices down it'd be a good value. As is now, $50 for 1 person to have an appetizer and a main course is just too much.
0	GzUX1OYI70tU6i4NaxAAA	Came in for dinner on Tuesday with colleagues of mine. We made a reservation in advance, which was a good idea since the place was bustling by the time I arrived later.   I'm not a big fan of AYCE sushi places to be honest. I always end up leaving there feeling fat, bloated and guilty. Luckily I went for a run that morning which helped displace some of my fat guilt.   The service was mediocre - empty dishes sat at the edge of our table for quite a whole before someone came to clear them away.  The salmon sashimi was reasonably fresh looking and tasting - but the others such as surf clam looked to have been purchased pre-sliced and didn't have as much freshness.   The only other complaint I would have is that not everything you ever order on your order sheet ever makes it to the table. I think it is just an unwritten rule that you'll get only as much as 80% of the items you order or 80% of the quantity you requested.   This likely won't be my last time here.. But I'll probably feel the same regrets after feeling like a beached whale again.
0	0AaQNyTsmjyX6IsxyeuTpw	Was just in Vegas after a 10 year absence! I used to love going to all the buffets when I visited Vegas as a child and young adult... after 10 years, I see that the buffets have gone down hill...   My friend and I decided on Todai because we wanted a combination of seafood and meat..   Food Selection: GREAT  Taste: Awesome  Decor: Simple, clean  Price: Too high for Dinner $33 dollars is a bit too much!!   Over all our experience was good and we enjoyed the food but the PRICE can be worked on a bit.
0	b6KVyvtdcaMJY7EjTvIdvg	They have got to have the worst soda in town. Half the time it doesn't even taste like what you order. And what's with this drive through diet thing they are promoting? It will give you the runs so bad you will lose weight or what?
0	Rka37vtya9AZt5gqQzxhQA	Was taken here for a business outing during my trip to Vegas for a conference.  How did I like it?  Luved it....sure did.....not only because it was off the strip and outside of a casino with fresh air and without the sounds of slot machine bells but because the food and sangria were d-lish-us.  Damn straight.    If you go, try to take friends.  Tapas are meant to be shared so the more people, the more plates.  Order the empanadas, the duck rolls, the cerviche, and most everything on the menu.  I am not a fan of lamb so I stayed away from those dishes.  Atmosphere was pretty good and music generated a great vibe in the place.  Definitely recommend it.    **They just opened a sister joint next door called Dragonfly.  It's a sushi place.
0	kTA13Fb7K76L37uDR2Wg	Food is great, been coming here since i discovered this place in middle school back in maybe 2002? it became a spot in high school for Durango students, only downside is they dont have dr pepper like they used too
0	MXImzph9H43H6tItzYH0qw	This is a very good neighborhood bar.  Definite Irish feel to it.  The food is decent, and the drinks are great.  It can get pretty crowded on the weekends.  They have a pretty great party on St. Patrick's day, take up the entire parking lot of the shopping mall they are in... pretty good time...
0	JLIqntieonaaGAMqQtM3w	The "jumbo" chicken wings must have come off of a pigeon, because they were tiny! The five cheese pizza was not very good, the crust was very chewy, and the pizza wasn't very cheesy at all. The Philly steak pizza on the other hand was pretty good..
0	dUHazBF11XwlxTFho4ts1w	Terrific chicken fingers!!! A great deal!!! The  cheese curds were good but a lil pricy for amount you get... Food and service was wonderful.. The atmosphere is very dated and the sounds smoke from drinkers at the bar were a tad bothersome... But we would come back for the Chicken Fingers!!!
0	FpDETgjZc2aOxz9FQWvqxw	If I'm in the mood for a Greek salad & some humus with pita bread, this is where I head :)   Not much to look at but the food is great & the service is friendly. If you're going for lunch I'd recommend making it an early or late lunch, it can get crowded.
0	eLqa6fYUeFuiX2jA4j2g9Q	I like this place for their quick corn dogs. The one pet peeve is when they don't give me ketchup. It might just me but I believe it should just be standard for every bag to get 1 or 2 ketchup packets. Is that weird?  Aside from my lack of ketchup I love their cotton candy dipped cones an jalepenos poppers with ranch perfection!  Ps whoever served at the drive thru was a cutie! That is all
0	ouuAbMPDt3kVL3ULWSEw	I'm not big on chain restaurants but Maggiano's is my fav italian spot!  I've never had a bad experience at the Woodland Hills location in CA and LV did not disappoint. The food is always great and so is the service.  I've tried a lot of the appies and my favs are the calamari, stuffed mushrooms and the shrimp oreganata! AWESOME!  I love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo.  As Rachel says...YUM-O!  The maggiano's chopped salad is also great.    This place all in all is great for groups or even a nice dinner with BF.  Keep it up Maggiano's!
0	2xVYDu3z8JbfkiL1cnxyA	The fried chicken breast was dry and overcooked  Potato wedges were undercooked  Honey mustard gold sauce was delicious  Hushpuppies were good  Mac n cheese was pretty good  You do get stuffed for $7 though
0	X3m7uP1EcF52S8WfNAXy8Q	First visit.  I'm not impressed. I had the pastrami lunch combo. There wasn't nearly as much meat as the pictures (yeah, I know - they're just PICTURES) and the flavor just wasn't there. Theirs is not a very tasty pastrami, so much that I thought I was eating ham before I remembered that I ordered pastrami.  The bread was O K.  Sorry, but I'm still in love with Firehouse, and will even take JJ's over this place.  P.S. Their soda tastes funny. (Coke anyway) my friend had rootbeer and can't tell.  Aside: correct usage of there, their and they're. Get it right people!
0	VynnEKkAg9uGahAIojeJg	Good Italian food run by (what looks like) the mob.  If it's not the mob, it's some good fellas, if you know what I mean.    I can personally vouch for their Chicken Parmesan, and their Sausage rolls.    Good service.    And friendly if you don't rat them out to the FBI.  Otherwise, you sleep with the fishes.
0	fUVCEKj7ewlDOlHSAGBRQ	BUYER BEWARE!  Wild East Pan-Asian Bistro at Carmel Rd & Pineville-Matthews Rd is advertising 1/2 off sushi Mon-Wed, but the sashimi was wafer thin and the discount doesn't include sushi rolls. I had an average experience at a price that you would expect to pay for fine dining. If you want... true 1/2 price sushi pay a visit to Johnny's Red Bowl Asian Bistro in Providence Promenade. Their sashimi is a decent slice and their 1/2 price sushi includes rolls, too!
0	mgULOcSONRHv0GEuHquVZA	This is one of the better jack locations I've been to. Sometimes the drive thru can be long but it moves quick. I get coupons in the mail so I use them most of the time and they take them with no problem. One of the best things Jack ever did was invent the munchie meal. It starts after 9 pm and changes but right now it's $6 for a hella-peno burger, 2 tacos and a mix of regular fries as well curly fries. The burger has jalape\u00f1os on it but also stuffed jalape\u00f1os and taco sauce. Damn it's hella good! Not that I expected much but I wasn't crazy about their mini pancakes. I'll stick to the ultimate sausage sandwich for breakfast instead.
0	T6werudVjL8ZNIvhwLtNpg	Never had a complaint about this place. Service is good, people are nice, and food is good. I mean you can't mess up spam, eggs, and rice. I mean someone probably could, but that person would deserve to get beaten with a stick immediately.. Other meals are also good. And for some weird reason, it doesn't take 5 years to get your meal. We sat down and received our order in less then 10 minutes! Closer to 5 probably! Nice..
0	dceZCDouxdKNlMsaBykgZA	Being a Yelper I've started to covet the groupons, google offers, etc for restaurants I've never been to before. It makes for a great opportunity to try new places. Since I spend a fair amount of time in the South Side this was perfect.  One night after work the boyfriend and I stopped down there with my phone in hand. It was early on a Tuesday night which meant that the place was pleasantly quiet. The two women working were incredibly friendly and we were able to get two steak subs (mine was plain steak and cheeses the boyfriend getting a mushroom steak)' fries with cheese, and a small drink which exactly used up the google offer. Using it without a print out was super easy too.   We got our food to go so we walked to the far end of the space to wait. Stickiest. Floors. Ever. It was like the stereotypical movie theater floor. Every single step my shoes stuck. The decor was interesting though, if you look up when you're standing inside there are doors hanging from the ceiling. I loved the dimension it added.  While waiting near the condiment stand I started to notice a bleachy smell. I have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell so it's not surprising that I noticed. I turned around to find a dump sink from a laundry room or mud room filled with incredibly strong bleach water. Good lord. Why? Why this there and filled during business hours. I couldn't eat in there with that smell to save my life. At least they want it to be clean, right?  Now the food: plain steak and cheese sub. I found myself surprisingly underwhelmed. It wasn't bad at all, just not outstanding. For the price I wouldn't order it again as I feel it's a little on the pricey side eateries on Carson St. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was a doubter when we walked in, loved his mushroom steak sub. The fries were good but a little soggy from the wait to get home. I'm sure they would have been a lot better if we had eaten them immediately  The short and long of it: I don't know if I'd go back, not because of the food or the service but because the only time I'm willing to pay that price for steak subs or to eat a steak sub at all is when all the drunks want to and I'm not into crowds of drunks.

Then she left and returned with her change purse and gave me a dime. As I was walking a way she made a comment that I shouldn't have wasted food. REALLY.....
0	GAlWrR4Y18yrfDhC5TxeLg	I really like this place. The burritos are HUGE! Also, the mini tacos were really yummy. The cooks and the cashiers were super nice. They even brought me a free taco, it was great too. I want to go back again. The atmosphere is a little different, had to bus my own table (it's a Mexican fast food joint).  They also add guacamole to everything. My friend and wife got some tortas, they were so flavorful.
0	ImtAKecIoz7gSGIqHoccA	This is a gem of a place. I stopped in while at a conference at the hotel around the corner, and was pretty pleasantly surprised. They had some great and different sandwich options. They were very good. The menu isn't extensive, but it seems like they do what they do well. The bakery treats are pretty nice and look quite impressive.   The place is small but also has some outdoor seating which is pretty nice at lunch time in a Chandler "winter."
0	piQB2qrY8AJhRFWZXv1Rdw	Seriously, this is a great sammich place in Chandler, and I frequently habit this place due to the excellent prices, service, and convenient location. They have free WiFi, btw, which is a nice touch, and located in a strip mall that also houses some other great establishments.
0	OGSMwfLFAuaZeyeQ8t1tkA	I really wanted to like this place. It's cute, perfect location with a beautiful view of the beach, and the decor was nice too. And they are serving a lot of organic stuff. I was really excited when I walked in, but like others mentioned, the service was painfully slooooowwwwwww. I got there about 11:40am, got seated right away, but nobody came to take my order until 11:55, and at that time, the server refused to take my breakfast order because breakfast was until noon. I asked her if she could check with the kitchen, and she did, but the same answer. In my mind, I wanted to argue "but it's 11:55, there is still 5 minutes left!!!" But I just didn't want to waste my time anymore. If they are ok with having me sit all by myself at the table, and go talk to a family who got in after I did  and take their order before me, then maybe they just didn't want me there. It's unfortunate, I really wanted to like this place so that I could come back every morning to get a coffee or breakfast while I'm staying in Portobello, but I think I would rather spend my money somewhere else where they appreciate my patronage.
0	5BIRPmXHnGfBRofhbJYXVw	I'm praying that I don't get violent diarrhea.  Not good. The steak was bland and the chicken tastes like what I could best describe as wet noodles...very strange.  Won't ever need to go back.  Stick with Moes/Chipotle/Qdoba.
0	BTFh3X37zoEpaaovc4bOeA	We went to Fremont Street and decided to eat here for the experience. It's a good thing we weren't there for the food. The whole nurse/hospital gown thing was kind of cute, but the food was horrid. Burgers tasted charred, not grilled. No one in our group ate the fries after trying one or two. They were soggy and tasteless. Blech!   All in all, cute theme, bad food.
0	trXqDdn52oq3lEtMrZXXIA	I felt like some authentic Mexican tidbits, and Taco Los Toritos isn't far from my nest, so I decided to give them and try for el dinner on Friday.  Located in a strip mall at Twain and Swenson, this little place struck me as very clean and service was prompt and friendly.    I ordered the burrito/taco combination which comes with rice and beans, chips, and a pile of shredded lettuce with a creamy guac dressing and a sliced tomato.   For $7, it was a lot of food, and all of it tasted mucho yummy and was served nice 'n hot. I took mine home, and it was still steaming when I settled down to nosh.  The carnitas in my burrito was flavorful, although could have been more tender for my taste, and the machaca in my taco was a tad on the dry side.     Still, the food here is fresh and flavorful and I will definitely visit again to try their ceviche tostada, quesadillas, and various huevos dishes.  They also offer a salsa/relish bar with various potions and jalapenos, radishes, etc.  I have posted photos of their full-color menu, which will give you a better idea of their many offerings.  Anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican fast food, will find a satisfying experience at TLT. Ole baby!
0	6t6K03EBEvoHY98jklE1A	Del taco is a solid fast food restaurant for sure. They have a great value menu. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The chicken soft tacos are incredible as are their chicken quesadillas. I wasn't a fan of their chilli cheese fries. They are located all over Vegas and out west. It's def a must try when you get the craving for quick tacos. I'm still addicted to Taco Bell tho but del taco can be a healthy alternative. Enjoy
0	FYQaI7KBOeKoTEWAxQE2g	Last time we ate here I rated it a 5... This time was average. I ordered 2 8oz steaks, a 6oz steak and a Philly cheesesteak. The food was average at best and the service wasn't much better. The server did a great job but I probably will not go back.  While we were sitting outside a different waiter had the nerve to pull the heater away to his table without asking us first, very rude...
0	Ky4Yp5HSPhVFjvMTgaSY1g	I thought this was a GREAt buffet for the price. The sashimi was fresh (not fishy at all), the service was great (when I asked for horseradish, they made a big deal about finding me some in the back kitchen) All you can eat oysters was really the reason I came here, and they were just so/so...the crab legs were cold, which I hate, but the sushi was great, and the shrimp tempura was great. I have no complaints other than they didn't keep the buffet stocked well, and they started breaking down about an hour and a half before they were supposed to close.
0	mMnJiwMvEtGQJpvsRkBw	I live less than 2 miles from here and was really hoping it would be a good neighborhood bbq joint. The staff appeared to be new to the food serving industry, but they tried to be friendly and were mostly successful. Man, I hate to be critical of places, especially new small business trying to make it but.. When I go to a smokehouse bbq place, I almost always ask what kind of wood they use since I sell smoking wood chips as part of my business. Problem here was I could barely smell any smoke. This was an immediate worry. The first two people I asked didn't have a clue what wood they used- What?? Note to owner: Teach staff what wood you use, it is a fairly big part of the smoking process. I ordered the pulled pork with beans and mac n cheese. The pork sandwich was a decent portion, however, as suspected, there was not much smoke flavor at all. Now you can definitely go too far the other way and ruin good meat by smoking it too long, but a decent chef should know what he is doing. The meat was actually mushy as if it were being held in a vat of juice or water. Not the way to do it. The sides were all of 2 bites each. the beans were ho hum and the mac and cheese was made with joint compound it was so pasty!  These are such easy mistakes to overcome, they need not be. Give people decent food and decent service and they will love you. Try to cut corners, forget it. Sometimes experiences sound horrible only because they were simply disappointing.
0	Y0GkTfVLeRgCVnNtZ3oA	House of Blues is like the Hot Topic of venues for catching a punk show. I've been to one in Orlando for a Bad Brains reunion W/ HR singing. I've caught a couple of shows here in the Vegas location. The last one was Rancid. They make you check in spike belts and kick you out for dancing too hard (hence the nickname "house of rules") but I sit up in the balcony and act like I'm VIP those days of effin' up the dance floor are over for me. It doesn't faze me but I think it sucks for the kids coming up. Either way I guess you can go to any house of blues and know exactly what to expect and in some weird way I like that. It trips me out that they have the Sai Baba portrait above the stage.
0	tPhbg33bHgUjdmXdmMCow	Delicious!!   I came here with a group of friends for a little carb loading dinner the night before the Rock & Roll Half Marathon. Service was excellent, food was excellent and the salad dressing was everything I expected it to be!   I really wanted the Gnocchi, however the only Gnocchi dish they had on the menu was in a white sauce. I'm not a big fan of white sauces, they are usually delicious, but are WAY too rich for me. I asked if they could make me Gnocchi with Vodka sauce and without hesitation my request was granted.   The Gnocchi was absolutely melt in your mouth amazing. Obviously home made, it had so much flavor and was exactly what I was craving. The portion size was perfect. Even had lots of sauce left over to soak up with my bread!
0	LK6mkb1AfEPCZgjbiDVgwg	I went here for brunch on Sunday and absolutely loved it! The building feels like it's someone's house that just happens to have a full bar instead of a kitchen. There are also a few other rooms to sit in or play billiards. The food was cheap and tasted great. If you are looking for a brunch place downtown this a great option.
0	XXwmktgVzm3Zj2VQlsLA	Fast quick and reliable for people in a hurry. Got the new honey sesame chicken and mushroom chicken. Good however the tables need to be wiped down more frequently. Staff is courteous and nice and was greeted with smiles!
0	BkFzv14s7IGjVpk7sIaylA	I thought I'd give this place another try, um no still icky.  I figured if I go to an IN & Out in a nice area, that's still new the food would be better.  Nope still awful, even though this time I tried a double double animal style.  Hello where is the meat in this thing?  I see onions but where is the taste?  All I could taste was pickles pickles pickles.  Less than five bucks for a burger and an warm iced tea and I feel like I got ripped off.  I really don't understand the hype with IN & Out, the food is just plain garbage.
0	moD1k3ATbMojFCXhCaJruA	Visiting from out of town and looking for a good Chinese place.  Read the reviews and decided to give this place a try.  Needless to say the five stars leaves a lot to be desired.  We got the orange chicken and the Hawaiian rice.  The orange chicken was soggy and not much flavor.  The rice also had no flavor.  Not a fan of Panda Express, but at least you know not to expect great food.  Here this place gets five stars and it turns out to be an insult to your taste buds, I want my money back.
0	hheRHbeXGkzWAdP6Af7zQ	Look, there is no reason for you to read the 51st review on this place unless you specifically sought me out and you trust me.  Matt's is good!  Go stuff yo face in a waffle and that thick cut bacon.  Mmm!
0	VV4BPSDxsTX8xPSyxBU7jg	The burritos are great, and very filling!  I manage to make it there once a week or so, the food is great, even if I become partially immobile for a short time after eating there.  I swear the rice expands once it hits the stomach!  Make sure you come hungry.  If I am going for lunch I've been known to take the "Chipotle fast" and eat little to no breakfast so I can just finish my meal!
0	hL6pLvJoQJbn23Aln637w	I've never had a bad experience here.  delivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.  Yesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.  Pizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.  LOVE.
0	BwGezp9jtwBEBSUwnR6g	A close second on my list of favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time.  I had the green chili (or was it the red?) and it was spicy and filling.  My margarita was huge and no skimping on tequila occurred. \r \r All that food for a low price - it's no wonder this place is consistently voted one of the best in the Phoenix metro area.
0	BHdoseHLxflhbvg6FZAGfA	About a year ago I went here and had an excellent steak and crab leg dinner.  The atmosphere was good and the waitress was excellent.  We went back recently for a mini celebration with our daughter and we were very disappointed.  The waiter was sort of preoccupied and unfriendly,  When I found out that crab legs were unavailable I was disappointed but understood why as they don't carry them year round.  They felt that I still needed to talk to the manager because of my disappointment.  I didn't but out he came anyway.  He was wearing yesterday's wrinkled shirt with what looked like food stains on it.  He also appeared very tired and thus unprofessional.   He apologized for not having the dish I wanted and told me when it would be available next.   The waiter could have done that.  They then spilled a drink over the back of my coat.  They got me a new drink, blah blah blah..... 2 of 5 stars for a chain restaurant.
0	YG4yDn74K8GD3ZlZwwWQ	We went to this Chipotle location about a week after it opened. I hope that they have fixed things since then. When we went there were approximately 3 times as many employees working behind the counter as there were patrons in the restaurant. There were three patrons, about 8 employees. Maybe bc it was new they didn't know how busy it would be but it was annoying to literally have half a dozen people have their hands on our food.   I liked: -The spicy salsa. Usually when places say spicy they don't mean it. It took me a week to eat this little cup of salsa with chips because it was so hot I couldn't eat more than three chips at a time.   I disliked: -Disproportionate number of employees -Dirty bathroom. For only being open a week it looked like it hadn't been cleaned since then. There was so much hair in the women's restroom it looked like someone got a haircut in there. Gross.
0	2dsaTDGYVVGX06eHS3uRg	I've been here a few times and I enjoy the cheesesteak with onions and both sweet and hot peppers quite a bit. It's better than other sandwich shops downtown. Aside from having a sandwich that I like, this place really needs to get things together.  It's never easy to park. I always have to drive around the block in circles trying to find a street spot to park.  On one visit I got to counter in the evening as the only customer and watched two employees sitting in the back on their cell phones for over a minute before being greeted and served.  I stopped in at 9:30 on Friday night, a half hour before close, and as I walked in I was told that they had no sandwich bread. I suppose it's worth it to Capriotti's corporate to pay their employees and the utility company to keep the lights on just to turn away paying customers. The more likely scenario is that they don't pay a manager to maintain the business properly.  Any business that runs out of the single ingredient required for their signature menu items and doesn't give customers a voucher at the door to come back for a discounted or free sandwich on the next visit needs to re-evaluate why they are even in business to begin with.
0	iQ0y873pvrhg3SwxtQ	The food is average-to-good Madison fare, but the happy hour prices are superb, the service is fine, and the management is incredibly helpful to the point of bending over backwards. The space is fine, but they have more pool tables for the size than any other Madison bar, which means not having to wait hours for your turn. Great Friday hangout while waiting for a show at the nearby High Noon.
0	VmAYX73IiA55HNdUlGWPrA	Ordered a whole mojara frita was disappointed it was over cooked ,and dry.  When I received my order ot corn tortillas they were NOT homemade.  Asked the waitress and she said the lady was not able to make them.  I say the lady rolling out the dough.  Left the fish and tortillas a waste of money.
0	4blD5bMDjLTvmbjJ3jzLw	The Commercial Center Mall is not the most obvious choice for Las Vegas' best Thai restaurant, but you will find it here nontheless.  Jonathan Gold of Gourmet magazine called Lotus of Siam the "best Thai restaurant in North America."  I wouldn't go that far, but it is very good!
0	kVe7WKQEtPX2h19rGMQkjg	I ordered a quick snack since I forgot to eat lunch.  I went through the drive thru.  I ordered some fries and a small burger.  My order was correct and tasted like it's supposed too.  The service was good and I was in and out of there quickly.  I went around 4:30pm.  I didn't have an issue.
0	uysqNJX2kbtbHjt5kD8NQ	This place tries to be a high-end "luxury" sports bar; it's almost as if the owners were trying to cash in on the gastropub trend, Las Vegas sportsbook style.  What really kills this place is the price of the food.  I paid $15 for a bigger that did not come with fries, and that was one of the cheaper things on the menu.  We also asked for two sides of ranch alongside the $8 sides of fries we ordered.  We were charged a $1 for each.  Don't get me wrong; I know I'm in Las Vegas and I know things are going to be like Manhattan expensive but seriously?  $15 for a burger, then another $8 for fries, and then you charge me $1 for ranch?  WTF?  At least the burger was good, but not worth the $15.  Unfortunately Aria doesn't have that many cheap places to eat (if any) so you might have to settle with eating here, but I would suggest going somewhere else if you're going to send $24 per person for dinner.
0	Idsbh1fulKsYQwZX1fR42g	This place is solid.  Always welcoming, beautiful decor, great sushi ... ok, I don't eat sushi, but it's the best magura (tuna) I've ever had, and it's consistent.  The reverse Happy Hour ain't bad either.
0	5xtE8SFSPnbKbaaqdA05A	One of the attractions for Las Vegas are buffets that offered throughout the strip.  This one is a definite must who into seafood.  Lobster tails, crab legs, shrimp, salmon, and so much more, this place is almost like seafood heaven for anyone that is really into eating seafood.  If I only had time to eat one meal throughout the whole day, I would go to Rio's Village Seafood Buffet
0	Ie6vLe5CRqQHKx46f0Hhw	Hungry Howie's....good, cheap pizza.  Yeah it's not fancy wood baked pizza, but for the price, you can't beat it.  Always good coupon deals around too.  I'd rank Hungry Howie's above Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's..any of the big chain, econo-pizza joints.  From this location, I've always had really good service.
0	2Kr00PNeszomTmT1NlO37g	Last week, on the way from the Airport to the Convention Center, me and my buddies decided it was time for some breakfast.   Fortunately, we came across this IHOP.   The place was pretty empty, I believe there were only two other parties there besides us.   The service was fast and friendly.   Our hostess / waitress (Shee was her name) was awesome.   The food was average for an IHOP.   You know what you will get.   As a bonus, this IHOP is close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.    This is a good place for breakfast.    Will I be back?   Yeah, maybe.
0	Meo9mBNBA84jDdXXaGu5tQ	I love Mimi's, and I love this location. My mom and step-dad go here at least once a week (usually for breakfast) and I got with my mom at least once a month. I am a HUGE fan of the broccoli and cheddar omelet (although they no longer have it on the menu, they still make it if you ask) and I love trying all of the seasonal items they offer. In the last month I tried the cinnamon brioche french toast (excellent) and the lemon poppy seed pancakes (pretty good but not great) as well as the new chocolate mousse muffin (to DIE for). I have never had a bad meal here, but obviously I have liked some things way more than others. The coffee is yummy and the apple juice is good too.   Service is, 9 times out of 10, great. The manager serves one day a week, every week, and I love when we get sat at one of her tables. Sometimes you get the server who is slow to refill drinks and bring the bill, but that can happen anywhere.  Also, sign up for their email club. We get coupons all the time. Buy one entree get one half off, get one free, that kind of thing.
0	MY0ZM4E2v5aNvxacilef4w	I am being kind as this isn't a super high brow eating establishment I didn't expect much.  The waitress was rude and phony, with us she acted like she was doing us a favor behind a tight smile. Meanwhile if she knew a "regular" she was all over them and asking them questions etc. Whatever.   The coffee was SO BAD I think it was there since the 1960's sheesh, we both complained and the waitress told us she has never had a complaint which was bull and by then I figured she knew it was lousy and was too lazy to fresh brew anything.  The omelet was hysterically small for "3" eggs. The pancakes were fine, the potatoes were cut so tiny they were fried bits of nothing, the muffin was so dry it was sandy tasting. The lemonade was ok, ( she did offer to replace the drinks).  Even with the coupon it was not worth it. Apparently the only plaace to get a good breakfast is Rainbow on Water Street in Henderson.   I doubt I'll ever go back.
0	Q9ZSfQtcy4vzx3rR71k0hA	Been a fan for a long time.  It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious not a combo you always get.    I particularly enjoy the Giant Caramba's Burro, granted we generally spit it between three of us, and I also love the Giant Stuffed Quesadilla, again usually shared.  Also they have great grilled fish tacos.   A great family friendly laid back place to grab food and a margarita.
0	iChAxe9ucApmtPeBAam7dA	When I first moved to Pittsburgh and had no groceries and was still grossed out by the perma grime left on my stove from the previous tenant, I pretty much went out for lunch downtown everyday. I am a big fan of Indian food and a big a cheap skate so Sree Foods was a perfect fit for me.  This place is no BS and the most unpretentious hole in the wall kind of dive you'll ever find. You go in with $5 and you get a styrofoam container and an elderly Indian lady gives you a big heep of amazing vegan Indian food. There's usually three vegan dishes and one chicken dish. They give you a little bit of all of the available dishes and throw it together in one container. They finally then throw in a piece of naan that is like the Indian equivalent of Wonder Bread but the great dishes make up for it.  It is a cash only spot and like I said, just $5 for this daily lunch special, and $1 extra for a pop. One thing to beware of is that they fill up your styrofoam container to the max. Sometimes the food starts to leak out, so if you don't want an unnecessary dry cleaner run, be careful.
0	3dkHyV2NmtF6pqD1Y7b8Sg	great!! have only been here once....you instantly sense the history and tight-knit family that runs the joint...this place is quaint and warm...i saw it on the food network the other day too! i had the shrimp scampi which were HUUUUGE and really really tasty with tons of garlic and linguine!  vegas is the only place (besides tahoe) that i feel has great, fresh seafood for being so far away from the ocean!!  good prices, good service, good vino, good atmosphere definitely worth a visit!!
0	tCRVOsfE1Oa16Pi3V3XOaw	Overall, the food was mediocre. I've had much better  bun at many other restaurants. Spring rolls were quite tasty however. The pho was acceptable, but light on veggies and herbs. Service on the other hand was absolutely terrible! Very rude waiter and waitress! Would not go back again just because of that!
0	pKdmZqO1NhDJW6npwy3cQ	My friend just emailed that he was going to Vegas this weekend and was going to set up a reservation to eat here.  He found out it is closed down.  NO WAY!!!  I am actually a little sad.  Alan Albert's will always have a special place in my heart. I remember back in 2000 when I was 21, two friends and I headed out on our virgin experience to VEGAS!  This was also right around the peak of the movie Swingers, so in essence, we thought we were "money".  Trent, Mickey and Sue headed over to AA's and had one of the best meals we ever had.  The Beef Wellington was amazing, the lobster outstanding and the prime rib was moist/juicey and as big as your upper torso.  We were drinking martini's and feeling very cool.  I will miss you Alan Albert's.  We will always have our memories.
0	26Ot3SEzw1S5TlEWtg6Q	Great hole in the wall.  Pizza slice is ginormous, not dripping with fat & really cheap. 2 slices of cheese for $4.50. Also ordered lasagna with garlic bread for $5, it was their special for the day. The lasagna was ok, nothing special. But the garlic bread was good. We also ordered chicken fingers with fries. The fingers are big. Only drawback is that it's at a very ghetto area. Overall, good place for lunch if you work near Fremont and you need a quick lunch.
0	BIDVhmkcThJzbOUoyKZfg	I quite enjoy this place.  It's nice to have the meat and cheese sliced in front of you.  Though it's a bit pricer than some of the other chain shops but it's well worth it.  The food has always been fresh and filling.  Their pasta is decent, but I prefer to stick with the subs.    The wait can be a bit long during peak hours, but it's well worth the wait.
0	UjQJsbDEQCzHT2a15GU0VQ	I dig this joint!  Stopped by because oregano's was jam packed.  So glad for that.  I had lunch with 4 buddies.  We had (Chris?), I think that is his name, (the owner of the establishment) order us 3 meals to split between 4 people.  Each of us had a drink and the bill with tip was 36bucks.  It was a Thursday in the middle of lunch hour and although I NEVER expect quick and decent service at a mexican joint, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our experience was 100% psotive and i would come back here in a heart beat.  unfortunately i cannot recall the exact meakls we had.  A fish taco of sorts...a meat taco of sorts and then another meal which 4-5 daysd later I cannot even try to describe what it was....sorry bout that.  Great experience, Great establishment..MUCH GUSTO to ya'll.
0	2GXyhvRp565DQmiFLAw	I have eaten at LCB many times.. I don't like the chain restaurants for mexican food.. I must counter the other review with the positives.  Their salsa is some of the best, its fresh, homemade and a little on the black peppery side.. They serve fresh bean dip (just have to ask now) and warm chips..    I have tried the combo plates, the fajitas and the spinach and cheese enchiladas. The cheese-crisp is huge with generous amount of cheese. I ask for tomatoes on top.. I like their tostadas and crispy tacos.. I try to get a Mango rum Pina Colada which goes well with Mexican food. As for the tortillas tasting store bought, thats news to me.. I think these are far better for restaurant made than most restaurants like Chevy's who makes theirs in plain sight!  If you like the chains of mexican food, Garcias, etc.. give this place a shot, you'll like it!!
0	fekdTNQwCm2lK22PfkQCTQ	For what's worth, I totally loved this place.  I'm sure Greek people find it insulting, but I totally loved it!  My gyros plate was awesome.  For $10.95, I got a plate full of meat, potatoes, rice and pita.  I was starving before dinner, so this dish left me more than satisfied.  What a deal.
0	0kQcZwFNCAQhCpY1rFzw	Weera is the epitome of badly Americanized Thai food, at least as far as their curry goes.  I was hopeful after calling them up and asking them if their recipes were different from Royal Thai.  Royal Thai also had pretty lame curry, so I was excited to give Weera a try.  I ordered the duck curry.  It was listed on a sign outside as a "special" dish.  It looked nice and red and yummy on the sign.  When I got my duck curry, the look alone had me concerned.  It was a light custardy color.  The taste... bland as hell.  I've never had such a bland curry before.  Yeah, the waitress forgot to ask me what spice level I wanted, but this was just ridiculous.    The other ingredients weren't bad, although they added little cherry tomatoes to try and boost the flavorless curry.  The duck was ok, and the veggies were fresh.  This fact didn't help me enjoy my curry though, unfortunately.  The first time the waitress asked me if everything was ok, I said yes, but I think she sensed something was wrong after I stopped eating.  She asked again, and this time I decided to give them a second chance.  I let her know that the curry was very weak.  She smiled and gladly took my plate back for a second try.  At least the service was very friendly.    When I got my curry back, it was heavier, not much spicier (as she promised it would be), greasier and saltier.  There was indeed more taste to it, but it was the average Americanized curry that really wasn't that good.  I wish I could muster up the ambition to come back to Weera and try other dishes. However, with so many other better Thai restaurants in town, including Thai Restaurant @ Sahara that's just in the next-door parking lot, I don't think I will be able to.
0	fOjLkZkd12zd87CgFhpw	Don't bother calling.  The guy who said they are "on time and target" must have an extremely slow watch.   They don't start your sandwich till you get there no matter how busy they are.  They always seem to be confused as to what's going on.  I'm not a Capriotti's owner but I would think it would be wise to at least have 1 person in charge instead of three try hards.   I guess the best deal.. I'f you could even call it that would be a large sandwich a bag of chips and a soda to split with someone.   But even then it's going to set you back almost 21 bucks.   Splitting is still expensive
0	JR7akr4DgguiGx0EGevQ	I've been here a good number of times. This is a great place if you're in the mood for Chinese food. Everything is delicious, I think I've tried almost everything on the menu at least once. The interior is always clean, service is always quick, and the sound of the chefs behind the counter make the place very lively and busy-feeling. It's always crowded for lunch, take what you may from that fact.   I only wish there there was a bit more variety to some of the dishes, because choosing from their menu is like making a sandwich. There's always going to be some kind of meat with rice or noodles, it just basically depends on the type of meat you choose.
0	rkWJxH0fG39Eu3jHIPdxZg	Went here as soon as we got off the plane and checked in.  Started off with a bottle of red to go with the free flatbread and hummus.  Tried all three appetizers trios - great lobster corndogs btw.  Main course was the Alaskan Halibut which was on par with what I've had at other seafood places.  You can add on half orders of Maine lobster or Alaskan crab legs - which is exactly what we did.  Plus one star for being able to see the wood-burning grill from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant.  I guess the manager was doing his rounds and stopped by to see how things were.  He invited us to come back sometime - maybe when I can afford to.
0	I0ANpBbXaM07ewVXNmCw	I'll take a side of burger with my order of grease...  I want all you yelpers out there to know that before I have a heart attack from eating at Five Guys that it's been fun, I had some great reviews, I don't think I'm gonna make it and I love you all... goodbye.
0	8cSZ5kfLm0yJipUFioumyg	Being new to Charlotte my husband and I were running around doing errands. We were hungry and used Yelp for help. Fontanella was nearby and showed one $. We decided to get a cheap bite to eat. Once we got there and looked at the menu the $ didn't seem accurate. Most of the entrees were $12-$15. Even though we were expecting cheaper prices, we were happy we found the place.   The server was friendly. The portions were large! My husband and I could have shared. We ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and Spaghetti Marinara. Side salads and fresh rolls are included. In addition, a side spaghetti marinara comes with the eggplant entree. We definitely enjoyed the food (and will enjoy the leftovers as well). We spent approximately $30 and had a very nice, quiet dinner.   The atmosphere was clean. There weren't too many people eating and no one was smoking at the tables, but I noticed that in the bar area smoking was allowed. They may just allow smoking in the bar, but it wasn't distracting at our table.
0	zJ0MQLNAPBKIRIzOMtjzA	Ordered pizza online - he took an hour to deliver at the house like its just 10 mins away  Last month, idk what it is but I went inside to order just one box of pizza and chicken on the side and the lady said it'll be 30 mins wait and I saw like 30 people working in the back
0	7u6yO0ktWp5r2T8UG0RfiA	The food is just ok.  A little overpriced for what you get.  I ordered a Mongolian Chicken, but got a Mongolian Beef instead.  The receipt clearly states chicken on the receipt (as photographed).  People are paying good money for the food and the place is crowded, yet they didn't turn on the AC.  I was sweating just waiting for my food.  While I was there, I didn't see them wipe any tables.  Just customers go, customer sits down.  The top it off, looks like the manager didn't even bother perfecting the receipt.  there's a line that says "Enter Website Here" on the 4th line of the receipt.  Manager that cares about details is essential to a business' success.  I guess this one lives off of people that crave chinese food before they fly
0	bnguZumoxYxYnumfUWQXiA	Had not been to the Broiler for years. We used to make this place a stop for dinner when we were LV tourist. Noticed a commercial for a prime rib special( $14.99) and it jogged our memory and we jogged.....well not exactly.....we drove over for a very nice meal at a great price. We did the 14oz prime rib special that came with their above average salad bar, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a basket of bread. I also had a very nice flight of wines for the bargain price of $10. Overall prices were very reasonable and the sides were only $5. which is a bargain for a LV steakhouse. A terrific restaurant with a nice soft ambience at a decent price. Will def put this place on our steakhouse rotation though it is a jaunt from Summerlin. Def worth the drive.So ono.
0	cRdYGqcLypgaLgQzfHKIhg	The best delivery pizza in C-U.  Sure, if you want superior pizza there are better options if you dine in, but you'll do well with these guys.  Hot, fresh and cheap (just like I used to like my men...).
0	hdbL6DwIwJRypRF23FTuA	Well, when I went into this place I did not know what to expect... I walked in and holy cow this place was so not mexican food. I should have expected not authentic duh... But nope. This place is like a fast food version of taco bell hahaha, or a fast food version of Baja Fresh. I ordered a burrito the meat was the only real good part of it. The rice and beans were dull to say the most. Plenty of parking, but the place inside is clean, clean bathroom, but boring colors inside. Weird because it has a lot more of these little stands everywhere here. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break into Mexican food and then go to little mexican places after this then to the big boys.
0	fCE54OzRb5Nt4D5VkarkEg	Fantastic! I will be returning again. Big night out was amazing. It was such a fun night. Very private with great ambience. The servers were friendly.This was our first time here and our server explained everything to us. The food was great but the desert stole the spot light. All I can say is YUMMMM! They have so much to offer and you will leave full. It took us about 3 hours for four people to get through the dinner but well worth your time.   Perfect for date night. Plan for 2-3 hour dinner. Have fun and enjoy.
0	TzDY3liNrvYeULDCvnWDw	Was really really really busy on sunday for dim sum but still everything was sooooo good, expect the duck. If it wasn't for the duck I would have given the place 5 stars. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, noodles, and pork & corn dumplings. Great staff, friendly and reasonable price.
0	tZkO2UflOgTogXUM1iYaA	Well.. I order a Enchiladas with adobada meet  Was the most nasty adobada meet I eat  The waiter was nice when my husband and I arrive  But I'm still waiting still for my refill she never bring me anything I am very upset I did not enjoy my dinner was horrible  This location in Arribas  I don't have idea what they sale but I'm sure Mexican food they don't sale NASTY
0	y8psEjvWlyo5KRETLn17w	i have an annual 'problem' relationship with edo. i order delivery for days in a row, and then i stop because of something they forgot, or they took to long, or i realize i'm spending too much money on takeout.  that said, they're pretty consistent with presentation and taste. i'm usually good at figuring out which day of the week a sushi place gets their fish delivery (making the day before that a relatively bad one on which to order), but i haven't been able to pinpoint edo's delivery day.  you can get 4 rolls for under $20 right at your front door! the fish is of a good texture, and as long as they don't forget the wasabi, i'll not be disappointed.
0	rkWtNCNUDyKjG50dEp0iw	The wings here are just okay. The fries are soggy and the place makes you eat out of 1 to go container even if you have multiple people on your group. They don't give you separate plates for your orders. They also charge you for everything and have instructional signs for their employees all over the restaurant in plain view of the patrons.   The most confusing thing though: Why do they sell greeting cards at the register!? "I'm hungry for some wings...oh perfect! A get well card for Nana. Can I get this and an 8 piece of mild wings to go?"  Hooters is honestly better and around the same price.
0	HOpZzea31Juf1KUYHtE6g	Food as outstanding and really cute decor. Had a really nice evening AND THEN THE WAITER RUINED EVERYTHING.  He had the nerve to tell someone at my table that she didn't tip enough and that he pays taxes on 15%. Some nerve! That is the name of the game...sometimes you make more and sometimes less. For this and only this reason, I will never go back.
0	hItcOVt9NmGy6IL8kMxVSA	Employees need to go the extra mile!!!  Great food, good concept, bad customer service, ordered over phone, 15 min later came to pick up, still had not started making.  Waited another 15, finally saw cook place to Go bag on counter, it sat there for another 10. No one bothered to say anything. Good food tho;)
0	yUkZecWtIjVZ8172pJNs5w	Skimpy on toppings.  You can design your own pizza and customize it but it is a waste of time. Ordered extra cheese, extra sauce and 2x the sausage but wasn't there.  Crust was undercooked.  don't waste your money, order Pizza Hut.
0	UFDufiNrgcYtDqUe07fg	I love eating at Chicago Joe's when I'm in Vegas.  The food is very good, and authentic Italian-American cuisine.  The portions are large, and very tasty!    I have had stuffed pasta, lasagna and fetticine and they were all fantastic.  The prices are reasonable too - I've had italian at several other places in Vegas, but I think the food here is the best for the price.    The atmosphere is quirky and very 'old Vegas'.  Everytime I'm there, I feel like I'm stepping into the past  and I always imagine Frank Sinatra or some old Gangsters eating there.  It seems like the 'local Italian restaurant', not some pretentious place where the waiter puts the napkin in your lap for you.   I think it would be an appropriate date spot even though I've never been there on a date. It's dark in there!  We were giggling last February because they still had Christmas decorations up, but it's Vegas, so we couldn't be sure if it was intentional.  The waiters are casual, and not overly friendly, though the last time I was in there our waiter was singing "Strangers in the Night" while he was busing tables, and I really enjoyed his playfulness.     I recommend Chicago Joe's it if you are hungry for  good italian food and don't want to go to a fancy overpriced place...
0	b3kCmHZ8Xgk0OXwbrOkPBA	Food as expected. Addition and subtraction of ingredients done right. Service was "eh" (waiter was a bit slow with bringing us water, coffee, taking our order, and bringing the check, even tho the place was only 1/3 full)  Clean and organized place.  I enjoyed my self
0	o6hbwLtjC1oVBjHCFaOg	Nice out of the way all you can eat sushi place.  I usually eat enough nigiri to make the trip and price worth while but as a discerning certified asian, I eat muuuuch more than I can handle.  I can eat way more fish than the $25.95 all you can eat price.  Only restriction is one uni and amaebi dish per person (and one toro when they have it).  The tempura here is very well done and somehow, in the middle of a desert, the fish is quite fresh.  Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm in town.
0	zqbWlUDXTYiQs9ilYBRo1A	It's not Hawaii, but it's as close as it gets on the mainland.  I really wanted to try "Mai Family" but as it was closed on the weekend, this was the substitute.  The "mini-plates" of Chicken Katsu and BBQ Chicken were more than enough food for the two of us.  I'm both scared and intrigued how big the normal plates were.
0	MxJ82rvjbePRmVj5y6QTQ	PHI bar has two great things going for it: cheap prices, and great location for CMUers. It's a great place to hang out, seeing as they, unlike some other nearby bars, aren't blasting horrid pop music so loud that you can't hear anyone a foot away. It does have a dive-y feel to it, and always has a strong smoke smell (of which I'm not a big fan). You can be sure to run into a few folks you know if you pop in.
0	AvZks4fUyk4ow0IPE5rt1Q	Not really a first choice for pizza in Surprise.  Went with my gym partner and we waited 5 minutes just to get his order in??  Decided to hang out, they messed up his order and not a fan of all the beetles crawling around the wait area.   If I could pick another pizza place in Surprise I would take any other of the millions in Surprise.  Sorry, but with so much competition pizza is overdone here. Top notch service and cleanliness is a must in my book.
0	3kL87zj3M5BgtTWSgLeigA	This is one of the few Filipino restaurants I like. This is because (1) my Grandma (my mother's mother was Kapangpangan) was such a great cook; it's hard to find something close, without getting so darn greasy (yuck! like, Goldilocks is on the greasy side) and (2) I am picky with Filipino food to begin with, because I don't eat all kinds of meat/fat/skin which eliminates lots of dishes (I've been cutting the fat off meat since I was a kid). We've gone here several times for lunch, with my family, but it's been a while.   The ambiance is nice (seeing as the majority of Filipino restraurants are fast food type places or buffets)- did you notice the hut outside the restaurant? Is it still there? Well, the service was generally good, but slow, at times. The staff was pleasant, never rude.
0	hVajFDzEasUyuBVWyEehA	Gotta love the way these guys advertise - free food samples!!  They came into our office a couple months ago with some of their Spicy Hummus....the rest as they say is history!!  I order from here 1-2 times a week, everyone there is super nice. And I like that you can place your order online. The free delivery is a definite plus!  I love the Spicy Hummus & the Dumplings, but the best thing on the menu has to be the Chicken Caesar Wrap - the homemade garlic dressing is phenomenal! All of their sandwiches are pretty unique from your standard sub shop, and I love that about them. The only thing I don't care for is their Gyros - and I love Gyros.
0	kfkBqMbIseMPLwJv3twEsw	This review is really for their drive thru service.  I had called my order in while I was in the plaza at another store.  Giving me ample time to finish what I was doing and then head over there before I headed for home.  Never using the drive thru here before I was a bit leery when I used the drive thru lane.  It's quite narrow and hard to maneuver through.  Especially since it runs between the building and trash area.  The food, even though it took me five minutes to get home, was nearly cooled the whole way through.  I know I could have heated it up in the microwave, but I kind of expected it to be at least lukewarm.  This made me think that the twenty minute wait I was to have was an over estimation.  Not even the tiny smiley cookie they gave me could make up for the lackluster meal I received.
0	ArhjKVgCjjL3FBESUQ1ZgA	I love to eat here! I get lunch here a lot. I like their chicken salad sandwiches and asiago cheese bagels with garden veggie cream cheese. They should keep it opened an hour longer, though. I know bakeries are all into fresh foods, but it closes before most get to eat dinner.
0	xpbJ21uQDCfuV8mDbB2A	I've been here several times, but I never reviewed it before.  We went here tonight and had a great meal.  Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.  We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.  For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.  For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.  I have a snack for TV time tonight.  I can finish my chips and guacamole while watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.
0	qL356mjEOFvjfy4qX6lQg	I received a "buy 1 entree, get 2nd for 50% off" coupon in the mail and when I saw a super burrito on the menu that had steak, chicken, and shrimp, my husband and I decided to give it a try. The gentleman (possibly the owner?) taking the orders was very nice and helpful. Upon asking, he told me that everything was cooked to order as I saw the cook behind him putting each of my super burrito's components on the grill. Their condiment bar had a couple types of hot sauce so I got the pink one made with habanero peppers.   When I got home and we dug in, we immediately realized how bland everything tasted. In a burrito that had the works: rice, beans, sour cream, pico, steak, chicken, and shrimp, it all melded together as one bland mouthful. This is unfortunately not what I was looking for when I wanted fast Mexican food. I was craving my greasy fix and got what tasted like a health-mex burrito. I figured that the salsa might help, but even that was so watered down, that I couldn't get any flavor from it, and only the spice. I really wanted to like this place because of the customer service and what looked like a fantastic menu, but they really need to fix their seasonings in the food and hot sauce to be more vigorous.
0	JeJbBdZrqZkMRsPU5yDW0Q	I did take out while visiting friends in the area. Unfortunately, there just isn't anything great that stood out about the place.  Staff: We did the order over the phone. Apparently, we were out of their area so they couldn't deliver. Unfortunately, my order came incorrectly, which wasn't the end of the world but disappointing nonetheless. Didn't really verify the order which probably attributed to the error.  Food: Had the Pizza Fingers and Gar Par Rings and a single of Sour Cream and Onion Wings. The Pizza Fingers were nothing special but still tasted alright, I did wish they were crispier since the outside was really soft. The Gar Par Rings was ok, but the sauce seemed like it was just squirted haphazardly into the container. I will mention that they were tasty but could have probably used less sauce. My wings order was supposed to be boneless but they came as traditional. Unfortunately, they were overseasoned so very salty, but the breading was done well. In addition, the side of fries were extremely soggy and I couldn't even finish them.  Overall, nothing really stood out and I could probably go to another wings place next time. However, I could probably go back for some Gar Par if I was in the right mood.
0	AksQQZUmhXceqlfOcoiLA	My mix fajitas were burn and rice was awful. Not only that service terrible she took our order and never came back to ask if we needed something else. I had to get up and get her from behind the counter she was just talking abc having a drink instead of working. I will never be back here the waitress was so lazy. $50 dollars for a piece of s.... Food
0	Abm8QJeSlZL3ZHden3qrg	Came here with a group of friends after an extremely long weekend of drunken debauchery on the Strip. It was a Sunday morning and not too busy yet. We were seated right away and offered drinks. I desperately tried to avoid more alcohol but they suckered me into ordering a mimosa. I tried to convince myself that I only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink (sangria, margarita, or champagne) when you order their brunch buffet. The mimosa was fresh and yummy.   The brunch buffet was $12.95 which includes the free drink and chips & salsa. The chips also came with a bean dip which was quite tasty. The menudo and posole were delicious. Rice and beans were great. Tortillas are handmade and served piping hot with your meal.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They seemed as if they actually enjoyed their job.  The bathrooms were clean and they smelled wonderful. I don't know what air freshener they use but it is divine.    I took one star off 'cause this place is pretty far from the Strip but worth the extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that there was a sign on the front window that said that they had been voted the "Best of Vegas" award for two years. That can't be a bad thing right?  I loved the fact that all the servers wore shirts that said,"Save water, Drink margaritas!" Definitely my kind of place...
0	Oimfj5s1lNSWp95qn9AdMQ	Ordered delivery and of course they get the order wrong after correcting him twice on the phone.  Food pretty much sucked. Would not call it authentic or fresh. Burritos were dry. Your better off going to taco bell.  Never will go here again.
0	zaXylMXSf9Dq6RZCzOLysw	Upgraded to a 4 star after going back a second time (something I'm trying to do unless I have an absolutely horrible time).  Great atmosphere, great to people watch.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The food was good to very good, but the drinks were to die for.  Excellent selection.  Nice spot to begin or end a date.  Central location in Old Town.  Definitely a fun time.
0	1whKmflJhkyVELnfMndKTg	Tuesday night and you don't feel like cooking? Head over to YC's.. fresh and tasty on the cheap! It's so much fun to because YOU control almost every aspect of your bowl.. mine is usually so full its toppling onto the tray.. there are just enough choices to keep me interested in coming back next time thinking, I wonder how that'll taste?!
0	qDo7dVMklOg35HFj9EaKQ	This place could be a lot better, but the service is simply not there. Went in there for dinner and it took about 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Waitress never checked in with us and had the nerve to drop off the check before our food even got there!
0	uCeL7MrXet5DC6SvBV2Vog	I haven't been here in a while, but I love their Greek food.  They offer Italian style food as well.  Their baked dishes always have great cheese and meals are served complimentary bread and hummus.  The Greek salads are wonderful with generous amounts of feta, caution though as the olives have pits.  The service used to be pretty slow depending on which waitress you had.  This is why my wife and I stopped coming here, which is a shame since the decor is nice.  It's in the style of an Italian kitchen with pantry items on shelves as decorations.  However, we do still get takeout as the food is great.
0	D9XjKf6OOqXBcywpoy5eHw	I didn't have high hopes for this place considering it's location, but if there's a vegan taco to be had, I'm going to try it. I had some sort of seitan taco and a veggie burrito combo. The taco was boring, served with just seitan, no vegetable to dress it up. The flavors were OK, but I've had way more exciting tacos. The burrito was big. That's about all you could say about it. It had stuff in it, but nothing very interesting. I was super hungry, so it was satisfying enough. The server will ask you if you want chips and salsa, say yes. It's $3 and the green is pretty good. Red was meh. The food aside, the wait staff seemed to have some serious issues. Everyone that worked there seemed to have been hired that afternoon. It was chaotic and an unnecessary amount of people were on the (tiny, tiny) dining room floor all at once. The girl "in charge" seemed to be about an inch away from a full blown panic attack, and there were only 6 tables. It was a bit stressful to watch.  Just a warning - If you find reggae music just as unbearable as I do, be prepared. You will hear it here, obviously. I think this place has potential. They need to tweak some menu items, hire a competent waitstaff and purchase furniture that is more than 5 inches off the ground (seriously it feels like you are on the floor). Basically, if this place was another restaurant completely, it would be good.   It's BYOB though! And cheap! You park on the street and apparently you should make reservations on the weekends.
0	4ROvYK9dGhHZBvzD1EgRag	Dining out is about more than just the food!   Took a 20 min. drive to try this restaurant because I had a coupon, and wanted to see what chicken and waffles was all about. We went early Sunday, about 5pm and were the only patrons in the place. There are two doors to enter-the first gets you into a vestibule which, sadly, set the tone for our experience. There was some construction related materials (bucket and cords) just laying there! Really! Why would you leave those there? We were taken to a window seat with a view of the parking lot in one direction and behind us a hallway to the kitchen with a trash can and a vacuum cleaner sitting there in full view. Wall, table and room decor is non-existent. Do they just not see what their customers are seeing?  We ordered the chicken breast and waffle and enjoyed both. The chicken was nicely seasoned, nice and crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, not at all greasy, and was a good sized portion. The waffle was good too. Our side of greens was okay-not much flavor and floating in a lot of water.  The service was very attentive, and our server showed us around the rest of the restaurant where they have a bar and showroom-they bring in comedians, musicians and a DJ on selected nights. It looks to have a great layout for shows.  When I have guests in my home for dinner, the very least I do is clean up! Julie's ought top do the same, and while they are at it, add a little decor to make the experience more inviting.
0	DICWehPdmprCOyr04Bzqw	Woooow, let me start with the good. The service was very good. Owner was friendly as well. The Italian hoagie was good, the chicken parm was frozen chicken fingers cut up and soaked in sauce. The spaghetti sauce was actually sour a little bit it made my eye twitch. The pizza we had was not good at all. The crust was below average and the pizza sauce had so much oregano in it and just no taste.
0	AMjHHhSswB8UTGOU3Aqwxg	It's a small place and heading over here after a Friday night Suns game (which was also First Friday) left us with little room to enjoy... too many people in too cramped a space. It seems like it would be a pretty sweet hangout if not too crowded, otherwise the sardine can cliche really describes the atmosphere. The area seems to be gentrifying and with the light rail on the way more places like this will start popping up in the area. Good thing for those from back East who appreciate non-Disneylandesque type spots with vintage character.
0	jKIvALwyX3osDznoNsFog	Filiberto's in disguise!  Alright, slightly more generic than Filibertos. The shrimp tostada was too sweet (yeah...sweet!?) for me, like some sort of cheap ceviche loaded on to a corn tortilla. Silly me wasn't expecting it to be a cold meal, but whatever, that's my mistake. Also, the carne asada fries are made with crinkle fries that are salted before everything else gets thrown on. It's gross, and their asada tastes like day-old steak soaked in brine.  I've gotta learn how to starve before going on these drunk Mexican food binges. Or just give my leftovers to Cornell.
0	ypco31DemK38L6p93DVCg	Stopped in here as a fluke. Turned out to be an excellent dinner. Went a while back when I was just getting into drinking red wine and our waitress was more then helpful when choosing a great wine. We enjoyed the asparagus friti for an appetizer which was amazing. I could not help my self when ordering so I had to get lobster for dinner, it was a good choice. Loved the whole meal, also the great service we received. Very pricey but worth it for a good dinning experience and a great meal
0	F5HgMy8M9soqcCpshLdmDw	Took my daughter there today for the 1/2 slushes happy hour from 2-5.  We got two drinks for $2.  The ordering was easy, as was the payment with the credit card.  The delivery of the order was quick.  I had a limeberry real fruit slushe and she had a strawberry real fruit slushe.  We hung out in our car, listened to music and enjoyed our drinks.    Getting into this place is a little odd because it is not actually on Boulder Highway, but set back with a medium in front of it.  I was going southbond on Boulder Highway, had to do what I thought would be a  u-turn, but ended up having to make a left, then left to get into the weird parallel street to Boulder Highway.
0	wub5mAZVs6ZRSqINyb0L7w	I went to Gandhi's  while in Vegas with a friend of mine from high school back in July. If you don't know where this place is, chances are you probably won't find it as it is hidden within a strip mall and you would think it was closed down if you didn't know any better.  We were seated immediately as it appeared that my friend knew everyone in the place. Everyone made sure to come over and say hello and to constantly check on us all evening. I actually felt like a celebrity with all the attention we were getting. Anyway enough about that, onto the food.  We ordered the Paneer Pakora which was homemade deep fried cottage cheese, Gosht Vindaloo, and the Chicken Makhanwala along with tons of Nan. I was in Indian food heaven. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Chicken had a nice blend of spices and the sauce was divine! I am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how good it was.   This place is a nice little hidden gem that you should really try if you are ever in Vegas. You do realize that it means you will have to explore outside of the strip so venture if you dare :)
0	468tRkMJOtkFuECTdEvw	The family and I and headed here last night. I was wary once I heard this was an Asian fusion place....and rightly so. The place just didn't deliver, and I think I am done with trying asian fusion places, the lack of authencity just makes it not worth it, and as a lover of Asian cuisine, I can no longer stand to pay for mediocre asian fusion.  I made the mistake of ordering the kimchi rice bowl even after I verified there would be no bulgogi, just beef fried rice. The kimchi was in the bowl and not even served cold on the side. The dish was as far away from legit Korean as the pad thai was from being legitly Thai. The veggie spring rolls and tempura were so tasteless. The salmon sashimi was decent. I didn't feel like what I was eating was proper Asian, and that was disappointing. I also think the look of the place makes it seem more upscale, but then you have regular jo rice bowls and a menu that doesn't match.   Service was good, but it's a sad thing to say that what I found most appealing was the decor and the chocolate mint sticks we got with the check. The decor is modern and clean, tall black chairs and tables, mellow red wall and green lighting by the bar area, and eye-catching wall decor and lighting.   I would maybe recommend this place for a drink at the bar, but definitely not for a meal. And that's a shame.
0	YghegJbl3jAYc8IaTRvPQ	I thought Trader Vic's was very nice.  Food was very good.  Atmosphere was great.  Staff was very very friendly and fun.  They even gave me tons  of recommendations of places to eat in the area since I am new around here.    I recommend the lamb.
0	ukmKk1HA49nd5Cyk5GuXsA	YummyTori is one of my fav places but was sadly let down last Friday evening through very very very slow service. Food as ever was yes yummy (bento box set meal is a great deal ) but c'mon you guys can do better!
0	2fdkOMQqGj7ZuO3FTC7w	So disappointing. The quality has taken a nosedive overall. They shrunk the menu as well but didn't shrink their prices.  Nothing came out of the kitchen that looked appetizing, unfortunately sitting my the kitchen so got a birds eye view of it all.  The burger was ok but that patty shrunk!  It's been progressively getting stickier and it has now reached, for me, maximum suckage.
0	bt0DBYXQ5Ym1cvjeaMDFxw	I work in the area so I've been to this location twice recently and I have to say its becoming a favorite.  I like that it has high ceilings and lots of windows - light is a good thing even though this whole damn city doesn't seem to think that.  Its also right across from the airport so you can grab a table by the window and watch the planes go by.  I always appreciate an interesting (and free) view.  The food has been pretty good but the service really needs improvement.  I do have to say that the waitresses I've dealt with were very nice but very slow.  I don't know if they need a busboy for backup with drink refills/silverware/condiments etc or another waitress to handle the amount of customers but it does seem to take longer than it needs to for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.  Oh, and I don't know if this place is nonsmoking but the 2 times I've been there I haven't smelled smoke at all.    Can anyone else confirm whether this location is non-smoking?  All in all I like this place but you may want to avoid it if you're in a rush to be anywhere (like to catch a plane for instance...)
0	n2Ftm9PXj4rWQdjxH2Xe9A	My favorite Mexican place.  There create your own breakfast burritos are so bomb and cheap. They def fill me up. I've never had any issues with my food. I would give them five stars if they would have a better english speaking employee at the drive thru. That is the only annoying thing. So really this should be a 4.5 stars!  So good! Awesome price!
0	uJvQynQtPfmg2nZm4rrdg	People standing around but can't make a sandwich. then you order a number and they have it half made with mayo by the time you say..."no Mayo"   Really have to watch and check what they make. Better quality than Subway but they just don't know how to provide customer service.
0	Tr6HJSQ4PjQbrBSah7ZOpg	How hard is it to take my order and give me what I ordered? The last three times have been progressively worse. Last time, order just nachos. Pico de Gillo, quac, and sour cream on the side. Get home, no PdG, no quac, no sour cream. Tonight, fish taco plate and nachos (same way as last). Nachos are fine, my fish taco plate magically turned into some sort of squashed enchilada thing in red sauce. HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP? I WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THRU AND YOU REPEATED THE ORDER BACK TO ME. I'm miles away now and can't go back. If I ever do. The food is just OK. It will be a long while before I go back. Even the beans and rice where nearly flavorless.
0	QSGQDZ8UqALzml7gnpRSUg	If it wasn't so far away from the strip, it'd be so much easier to get to, but even still, we had a car to go to this place for some good INEXPENSIVE foods.  I had chili and rice (a local favorite and mine) and my boyfriend had Chicken Salad.  His salad was pretty good, and even the friend won tons actually had meat inside.  That's the surprising part.  it was really good, and of course how can you go wrong with chili and rice.  We got away really good with our bill, wasn't too pricey.  We spent more on the slots than the restaurant, and we actually got food out of the restaurant!  Overall, I've always come here at least once just to eat some good local food, and I've never been disappointed.
0	cqLODEArMQUP6Chjt5quhA	First time here for a friend's birthday and I have to say this was a fun, delicious Italian experience. We were in the side room, which worked out perfect for 20ish people in the group and food was served buffet style.   The first impression was with the bread and oil which seemed to be borderline salad dressing with the amount of herbs in it, but nonetheless it was delicious.   The antipasto salad came in a huge plate which was devoured almost immediately and for the main course the lasagna was a simple recipe, "straight up" pasta, sauce and cheese. No frills here and worth it.   The did seem to be a bit slow with the service on water/drinks but nothing to be too concerned about, probably standard for larger groups.
0	PifjvdPOYGr1oSdip5vaww	First time visiting and it would probably fall between 3.5-4.  Came with the fellas and we all enjoyed the food.  We had two of the seafood platter.  Good stuff but very over-priced for what you get.  But hey, this is Vegas, it's the Bellagio, and it's a place with trendy decor.  None of us had drinks as we were planning on getting drunk elsewhere.   After the starter, we had dinner.  Most of us ordered the rib eye which was very good.  Someone had the braised short rib and said it was very good as well.  We ordered all the side dishes to try.  -Potato croquettes were good. -deep fried/tempura asparagus...good. -another green dish, wasn't memorable because i can't even remember what it was. -fried rice....good  great service, great atmosphere.
0	4R0vfr5Q2UrXpdtfXGe04Q	I would have to say I have had a lot of Greek food in my life and this was not even close.  I had the Gyro not sure what meat but it had the spices from every other dish because they were not cleaning the grill of between orders.  Can't say I would go back.
0	m32jZMcAmIoRRWZFJ8WrA	I got hungry after gamble.  so I went to grab some ham and cheese wrap $12  at 3 am from Pizzeria da enzo.   It was alright but It wasn't worth it.  I was still hungry.  I saw this dude ordered pasta (about size of 2 taco from jack in the box) cost this him $15.  I wouldn't recommend this place.  if you are hungry, head to strip for 24hr mc D.
0	4FKyENvFBAMAkeyxsRC4A	Mediocre meal; did not have the "wow" factor I was hoping for.   To start, the hostess attempted to seat my client and I (both in business suits and obviously on a business lunch) at the "communal" table, where she said we would probably be joined by other diners but that "it's okay, because everyone is family."  We glanced around the restaurant and noticed lots of open two seater tables, and kindly requested a private table since we were on a business lunch.  The hostess seemed a bit flustered by our request, but did let us eat at our own table after offering us the bar instead, which we declined.    We tried the chips and salsa, queso fundido, langosta tacos (lobster), and mongolian beef lettuce.  The best part of the meal was the lobster tacos.  They were actually very tasty, although on the small side.  Everything else.... not what I expected from such a well known chef.  There's just not much to say besides it just being mediocre food.  Both of us decided it was not the memorable meal we were expecting.  With all of the dining choices at The Cosmopolitan, I will certainly try another option next time.
0	Weog7BtE9oa08EPXbZylg	We stopped in for a bite before a Yelp Event. We sat on the terrace and waited for the waitress to stop by our table as she delivered the only other terrace table's meal. She didn't even make eye contact. A few minutes later we ventured inside and were told someone would come give us menus (there were 2 kitchen boys + waitress/cashier). The waitress came out and dropped our menus. After waiting another 10-15 minutes for her to come back and take our order we went inside to order at the register (if this was the procedure, our waitress failed to mention it when dropping off our menus). The food was ok, the chef guy was super nice/helpful but I don't get the point of using half waitress techniques and half cashier techniques with customers. Telling us to wait for service that doesn't come. It left us very confused and feeling as though customer service wasn't the point of this establishment.
0	46360tOb1SNTgbq3BJRKIw	Expected to wait a long time (we had 7 adults, 2 kids and 2 infants) They mixed up some food orders and we got our food after a couple of tables that came after ours. They ran out of the fried leeks for the chicken and waffles but didn't tell us until after we asked about them and had finished our meal.  We didn't know until my friend in our party pointed it out.  Anyways I thought the food was pretty tasty.  It was just the service that  we weren't crazy about.  Without the service I would have rated it 3 or 4 stars.  Anyways I emailed the owner and they were friendly and apologetic.  We are going to try again (maybe at the Sahara location).  I will update the next time I try this place.
0	zUpKbabsrKEIRE2viPcnQ	Food wasn't that great. It tasted very bland and fried rice wasn't good at all. I'm pretty sure it was made with parboiled or instant rice. I wouldn't eat here again. There are much better options in the airport.
0	tjJHuBw2q3HYu7hSrBoxQ	The place only rates one star but gave them a second star just because they have some other beers available besides their own terrible ones that don't taste like toefungus. Food was average at best. as was the service.  One would have hoped a repackeaged Electric Dave's would improve itself but alas it hasn't.  Plenty of other options on Mill Ave or Four Peaks that are so much better.  Just a matter of time before this place closes it doors.
0	W6Ymp8cxJORuQqAA2YoBZA	Been here a few times and I always enjoy the food.  I think of this place as having good ,but not exciting or overly spectacular, food.  Service has always been spot on for me.  The dinner choices are pretty standard, but I've only have a few of the most common ones, Orange Chicken, fried rices, a few other stir fry's etc.  So the sushi thing. I've never had anything but the rolls here. They're big, more than one bite for each piece, and come with about 8 pieces each.   I like them. I know that a Crunchy roll or a Spider roll may not be true sushi but I don't care I still like them. Damn good I tell ya.
0	uZr3yM3qGCoaPn6ISBICA	I am puzzled by several of the very favorable reviews. As someone who likes to frequent local bars and restaurants, I gave the Mirage a try on several occasions. Each time the food has been greasy and far less than favorable. The lounge is less than clean. Although the the service has been friendly, it falls way short of being even remotely attentive. With this, the menu prices are indicative of a much nicer establishment.   All things considered, I would not refuse to go back (especially given the lack of nearby options), but I would hesitate to do so.
0	lKsk0xbv3DqXpJs6KXHFew	I love round table dont read too much into my review i may bias your opinion give it a try ... they offer all u can eat n i plan to over indulge n gain lots of pounds ... but definitely change the game n commercial pizza
0	e8TmQevvKYuHKg48nJQA	I was very disappointed in Cane's. I went there expecting something better then KFC. After looking at there web page I thought it looked like a pretty awesome place to try. I went threw the drive thru and place my order - the box combo- and some unsweetened tea. When I got to the window I was greeted by a semi-nervous teen. She reminded me over and over that it was made fresh and that's why it would take a minute.   After repeating how fresh it was I was really excited to sink my teeth into a crispy chicken finger. What I received was 4 soggy pieces of chicken a random piece of bread (not really toasted, and if it was suppose to taste more the just bread it didn't) and crinkle fries that I could have made myself in the oven at home. The chicken's breading was so soggy from being deep fried it came right off the chicken. The only thing that really tasted great was the coleslaw.   I was very disappointed. I would recommend KFC or even the Pool Hall (Silver Q Billiards and Hookah Lounge)  at 67ave and Cactus before I would tell someone to go to Raising Cane's.
0	QbCR5vegyVUP74BNGWNX3Q	Cook Out otherwise known as my fatty food fantasy; simply put this place is amazing. I have to stop here every time I'm in Charlotte. No, it's not healthy, but who cares when you can get a foot long hot dog, hush puppies, chicken nuggets, and an oreo milk shake for under $8!!!  Oh and the milk shakes are truly amazing!!
0	nvCdqnVQIYoQ5ePt0K6g	Disclaimer: The two star rating is based on neither the food nor the service; rather, an experience.  A friend had recommended Sal's to me, so yesterday (9/6/10) was the day. Read the two rave reviews here. I live 30 miles from Sal's and drove in specifically to visit for the first time. Imagine my disappointment upon arrival to find a hand-written sign taped to the locked door which read, *Closed for Labor Day. Visit us Tuesday, etc, etc.*  All was not lost; the competition down the street was open and more than happy to sell me two large pizzas....  By the way, as of the time of this report, Sal's apparently does not have a website. The link provided here ( www.SalsTuscanGrill.com ) leads to a placeholder page, until such time as the domain name owner actually creates one.
0	tTHVQItpZrYZF0qtUTPcw	This is really, really good thai food.  I always get the coconut curry with tofu and have never once been disappointed. I have brought several people there that have always enjoyed.  Lilke most Thai restaurants they close between lunch and dinner, so check the hours before you head out.
0	XkPCag5N26VGDN8SRf9Vg	We've been coming to this place for 3 years - each year we hold our breath that it will be as good as last year.  So far, so good.   Nothing elaborate, just good basic comfort food with a friendly staff and friendly owner.   We love breakfast here and keep coming back.   And the prices are good.   Highly recommend giving them a try.
0	zpl0ZY0yiSAdSQF9vDgy8g	The Wife and I decided to give Which Wich a try since we were driving past and really like subs. We'll keep driving next time.  Overview (copied from their website): "Guests use red Sharpies\u00ae to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. They select a sandwich from one of 10 categories, then choose the type of bread, size, cheese, spreads, and vegetables. The sandwiches are prepared to guests' exact specifications and delivered in personalized sandwich bags. After they've enjoyed their wiches, guests are encouraged to draw on their bags with the same red Sharpies and hang their 'artwork' on the community wall."  At first, this seemed like a cool concept, but we were quickly frustrated by the fact that, having just spent time deciding what we wanted to eat and marking that info on the bags, we then had to stand at the counter while an employee inputted each of our orders -- item by item -- into the system. It would have been much faster for us to just place our order at the counter in the first place, rather than repeating the process twice.  We waited nearly five minutes for our sandwiches, even though there was no line in the place. While I understand that time and care must be put into making sandwiches, I've been spoiled by places like Jimmy Johns and Potbelly where sandwiches are made quickly and taste great.  Which brings me to the taste of the sandwiches. Meh. I've experienced better. The bread was, at best, forgettable (the Wife hated it). The meat (pastrami) was overly salty, and the sauces lackluster.  Overall, to the question of "Which Wich?" I reply, "Pretty much anyone else's!"
0	MgYfS43Ln18LHK35WBKvA	1st time here... Ladies Night on Thursdays with the law school crew... No cover before 10pm. We made it... Upon entering, Dude Deon tells us drinks specials with "M's" Margaritas, Martinis, Mimosas.. etc...so we're ready to have a good time. Mature "lite" crowd. Ambiance, cool. However, bait and switch on the drinks... smh! $10 Martini's (told after we ordered a few). No comps. Ordered food... wings and fish (batter on both- lite to no seasoning). Music- Slight "ratchet" and old school with minimal Top hiphop 40's. Ironically, we were warned before entering... 2 stars for potential... Food-NO, Drinks-NO, Customer Service- NO, Music- ehh... NO. Photographer gave us a nice keepsake though... Will we return. Probably not! Step it up, Michaels... Your promoter, Deon made you lose our business.
0	vrAzaU6Dq7xW26r78GIFwQ	Pricey, pricey, pricey.  But the chicken wings and mac and cheese made it all better.  I've never had a chicken wing where I was able to consume every last bit of meat.  Ingenious method of preparation.  You'll just have to go yourself to see what I mean.  Oh, and the mac and cheese.  Isn't turning it into a Twinkie one of the miracles that Jesus performed?
0	qBukqciaaKYb0JBzQ0Ow	I went here with my family for a Sunday brunch. Luckily we had a reservation, because there was quite a line of walk-ins waiting. I loved the unique experience of eating in the lobby of a theater. It was very airy and slightly cold, but still a grand atmosphere. If you haven't been in the Orpheum before, it's definitely worth leaving your table and exploring the facilities a little.  The brunch buffet was neither too snazzy nor too plain. I enjoyed having the basic brunch options of pancakes, french toast, sausage and bacon, but also appreciated the flare the lox/bagel platter, vegetarian eggs benedict, and spinach salad brought to the meal. The only thing I felt was really lacking was a good selection of desserts-- but honestly after eating some of all of the above, I didn't have room for another bite.  The staff had some trouble keeping up with bringing out fresh batches of food for the buffet line, as well as clean plates. Granted, I was there on a very busy day, but having to wait 15 minutes to dig into an avocado vegetarian eggs benedict is painful! Also my table's server wasn't quite on top of it--we got our "how the buffet works" spiel about 20 minutes after we arrived.  All in all, a solid brunch in an enchanting atmosphere.
0	R24ax4secQ7u7dKNtziew	Two things that I miss since turning veg in  January, BBQ and BBQ. This place has it all, brisket, chicken, pork, and all the fixings. Don't worry about me though, I get my fix from Morningstar Farms Ribletts. Sorry ....that's another review.  The Pittsburgh BBQ company is hidden behind Banksville Rd, you can smell it before seeing it. And that smell is amazing, more amazing as you get closer.    I used to order the brisket sandwich, it was tender, juicy, and loaded with smoky flavor from slow and low smoking. The slaw and beans rounded out this dish that no steak can ever wish to top. The chicken was good too, as are the ribs. But to me BBQ means brisket.  I still get the beans though, pretty damn good and they really fill that void for BBQ!  Hurry this place will be shutting down for the winter, usually they shut the doors for the winter in November and reopen in the spring.
0	MGxkkEZXY4Rg8YiNhltvkA	Not a bad place to go but definitely wouldn't be my first choice of a bar I'd ideally go to. It's convenient to go to watch football however because there are flatscreens everywhere and it is also really close to my apartment. I've been here three times and service isn't bad but it wasn't great. I definitely had to wait about 20 mins to get serve. They aren't very attentive and don't really seem to care much about their guests. We usually sit by the pool table where the bartender can clearly see us yet every time we're there they still seem to ignore us knowing we've been sitting there waiting for a while. Okay I'm a server/bartender I know that even if its not you're section you should still acknowledge your guest. .  Overall Food was good, service was decent and the atmosphere was okay.
0	aDAkjSUZ89ctixHO2WrUXA	Mediocre food, slightly better than mediocre service. The cashier got our order wrong, and when we sent it back she got the order wrong AGAIN. Besides that, the hamburger patty was way too thin for the bun it came in, and the taste reminded me of a Burger King hamburger. We also sent the fries back, as the fries had been overcooked then left to become cool. Gross. NOT coming back. Recommend in & out, 5 Guys, or Red Robin if you are serious about your hamburger.
0	i09mOSjicLKS99Kquiw	I went there for the first time this week and know that I will definitely be returning many times.  Largest selection of Belgian beers on tap in Pittsburgh, and plenty other beers if that's not your style. I went for Happy Hour (4:30-6:30 on weekdays) with a few friends.  Not crowded, we were seated immediately.  Because it's not in close walking distance from any colleges, the place was not full of college students, which is a relaxing change of pace. The food is excellent, especially for a bar.  There is a keen fixation on garlic, but there are plenty of other delectable items if that's not your style.  Highly recommended: the Mediterranean nachos, Buffalo Bites.  There is even a $0.40 special on Buffalo Bites on Tuesday nights. Wait staff is nice and prompt. This is an excellent establishment and would be 5/5 stars if it was in a more convenient location for me.  But it is accessible by bus and there is parking.
0	0OEvDMBlzA1Sej5ia1RJjQ	I showed up last minute for a catering order.  The staff was able to throw my order together very quickly and get me on my way.  The quality was consistent with their usual high standards. I am grateful for the great food and service.
0	v0d4DwBDGaka5TKCu74KRw	This Wendy's looks to be less than a year old, but it's not kept very well.  It may have been bad timing, but it seems like none of the tables were wiped up and the bathroom was super dirty.  When we came in, there wasn't a large crowd or anything... it's a shame since the inside would be nice if it was just tidied up.  The parking lot is very awkwardly designed.  You have to park on the side of the building and it seems like the drive-thru was the main forethought here.  Service was super slow and the staff didn't seem that friendly.  I only ordered a frosty and it seemed like the employee was pulling teeth when mixing up the oreos into it.  I still enjoyed the frosty, but it made it way less fun to see that the person making it was miserable.
0	jrdk7jrC8vueFWyLVtrQ	Dos Gringos is a good place to go grab some drinks and some food to snack on. Every now and then we will go hit up happy hour here because they have often drink specials.   Drinks: They have good prices and a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers. Normally they have some type of special whether it's happy hour or not. Their margaritas are very bland and taste like they are a result of some type of random mix. I normally just stick to beer.  Food: My favorite thing here is the Nachos! They aren't badly priced because they are HUGE! It's best to get them with some type of meat chicken or steak. They come with sour cream and Guacamole. Their Guacamole is very good and isn't filled with sour cream or large chunks of tomatoes.
0	g94ysITA3ozqarEamXq2Gw	In sum, the food was ALMOST okay. Save  your dough, order take-out SOMEWHERE else in Pittsburgh. I consider the pasta dishes along the lines of Pizza Hut. Basically,  it is bland and an insulting misrepresentation of Italian food.  I struggled to rate this. I considered giving them a 3. Merely based on the fact, the pasta they do not prepare in-house, the Fede pasta is local. Fede pasta is a pasta company located right outside the city of PGH. However, giving them a rating ONLY based on something they happen to carry and do not actually "make" seemed too gracious.  Can I also say what a major pain it is to have to get up from my table to walk to the other side of the restaurant in order to read the wine list.  Someone cannot type one up or use an etch-a-sketch? ((Yawns. This place very much underwhelmed me))  Overall, the establishment did not put much effort into a pleasant dining experience therefore, I will not put much effort into writing a review. I would not recommend anyone to eat here and I will not be returning.

0	4CX4gWCoWcfiRt1aPOeB7g	I've had breakfast here many times through the years and the muffins are really good. The breakfast menu is a slight step up from the average breakfast joint. Minus one star because a few times I've come in for breakfast late and the muffin i was served tasted microwaved.
0	mu24V5tEAyxxX1EJj1Fw	This place is shares a drive through and building with Long John Silvers. I ordered a burger, it came on a bun that was falling apart, one very small onion that didn't even cover 1/4th of the burger and overcooked bacon. The actual burger itself tasted alright. It saddens me when bacon gets treated that way.
0	KIPRYBA8Wx2Dv9fqIW8niA	Excellent service, clean tasteful decor, but poor food. Not a great experience by my standards . I had negi ramen, friend had ajo ramen. The old vegetables and meager chunks of pork in both our dishes were disappointing. My miso broth was tasty, friend's ajo ramen broth was strange. I might come back a second time, but would not rave about this place.
0	TvQWpBcyPrNXU8AUagEg	We went to Chili's because we used to get the best dry rubbed ribs there. I read the current reviews before we went and I was somewhat hesitant but they used to have wonderful ribs and a great Quesadilla Explosion Salad which I loved. The place looked as usual, clean, loud, friendly.  The kiosks were new and kind of neat. I started with a watermelon marguerita which tasted good, only had one as it was nearly $8.00. Not a lot of alcohol in this drink as I seldom drink and one good marguerita usually makes me notice!  This one did not.  We waited a long time for our meal. Ordered chips and salsa, rather expensive at 3.59 a pop and most Mexican restaurants serve these free.  We, there were three of us,cleaned up the chips and continued to wait for our meal. We were offered another plate of chips but at that price we declined expecting our food soon.  We waited some more. Finally our meal arrived I would say it was at least 45 minutes after ordering but not bad if you are served fresh hot food.   Well the ribs were warm but not fresh off the grill. In the center some of them were dry and cold.  The salad I come for had probably been plated earlier as the lettuce was wilty warm. The quesadilla's were cold and the cheese inside was cold, hard and not very tasty.    The waitress asked us how we liked our meal and we expressed to her our disappointment.  She appear uncomfortable on hearing our complaints but gave me the opinion she had heard it before.  She said, they had one good cook, and he always plated and got the food out while it was fresh but he was not the one who did ours.  She said when we come back to ask and she would take our order to him. We will not return.   I advise you to take heed of the comments in this review prior to dining here.  For a dinner that costs more than you would normally spend you should get a real treat.  Not here!  We should have spent the $70. on real steaks and BBQ'd at home it would have been money better spent. And the meal would have been hot, fresh and tasty.
0	5eyCRiPuMDxrO431uOdpQ	I finally am catching up with my reviews after making Le's a semi-regular lunch spot, thanks to Tony C's favorable recommendation.  By now, you have read all about the location, tucked away in what looks to be a dying mall in dire need of renovations where even the parking lot is scattered with weeds growing in between the cracks.  Despite the rundown setting, Le's Sandwiches & Cafe serves up great sandwiches.  Fresh bread, good veggies and friendly service.  This is probably the most authentic Vietnamese food establishment I've seen in Charlotte.  I always go for the white ham and pate sandwich.  You can order the bread regular or "long" baguette style.    For those of you new to banh mi, the bread is light and crisp, you can choose your meat and all come with pickled daikon and carrot slices, cilantro and peppers - a surprising taste combination that is simply excellent.  (Take the peppers out unless you like really spicy food; they are hot.)  The Vietnamese coffee here is just OK, a bit on the pricey side (I'm used to paying $1.50), a little too dark for me (I've had better), but I must urge you all to try this place.  I tried the Bubble Tea (Green Tea Latte with Boba) - well made, but the boba was a tad hard here and there.  Still Le's is quite the find and is the only place I go to out here to fix my Banh Mi craving.  And now, I must footnote to say that if you are in So Cal, go to Banh Mi Che Cali for the best sandwich ever. But, at Le's you can just get a glimpse of what a great Vietnamese sandwich is like.

And while I am still not a PHX Chinese food lover yet, Chen & Wok helped better my view.   The crab puffs and vegetable lo mein are great. My friend got the Sesame Chicken and wasn't too impressed...  It wasn't that horrible but I wouldn't recommend ordering it. The egg rolls were decent, but not the best. The thing that made it for me was the egg drop soup. I love it, but i hate the stuff you get from most places that has a consistancy of snot. C & W's egg drop is light and liquidy, like soup, not ooze. It was tasty, with mushrooms, peas, and carrots.   The best thing about them: they told us the food would take an hour, they were at my house in about 30 min. So yeah, I'll probably order from them again, unless someone in yelp land lets me know about a better spot.
0	tz7r7hPtDLIQDFZaXvxRDQ	While the decor and location are undoubtedly cool & I understand soft openings can be tough, we had a similar experience to Nathan M. on Sunday...very poor service, lackluster food (one sandwich came out 10 minutes before the second one, and even when we pointed this out to our server, she said oh, yeah, the other one is on it's way...when we finally got around to eating the chicken pesto+brie+sundried tomato sandwich -- there was no brie, 1 sundried tomato and a splash of pesto on the bread). And as I looked across Scottsdale Rd. from the patio, I found myself wondering...if a duel broke out between Billet Bar and RnR, I know who I'd put my money on - and it's not the server in the purple & teal vans.
0	4DpisiRs3wxuH8sWDJyPg	Well, you know a fancy decor and a great staff does not make up for crappy food.  Now before I slam the food, let me say that the staff was great.  They were very knowledgeable of the menu and did everything right.  My $65 steak came out and it looked like I burnt it.  I had to get some dipping sauce it was sooo dry.  I had the wild mushrooms which were good and the parmesan bread sticks were also very good.  If I had come for that I would rate this place 5 stars.    I would not waste my time or my money here again.  I will keep looking for a good steak house that I do not need a loan to eat at, total bill $135.  :(
0	y4fzhRujZnqkByFUOpurQ	A few weeks ago was looking on yelp for a place fairly close to home with a patio ... which is not easy to find in this town.  Crazy, since I'm originally from Chicago in which the weather is good approximately 5 days a year (insert  sarcasm here) and yet there is a patio on every other eating establishment.  Anyway, I digress....  Let's start off with the view - fan-flipping-tastic!  If you find yourself in Henderson this is the place for a great view of the strip and also a nice sunset.  The patio has heaters and misters, too!  Now the food - the shrimp appetizer on the rock was okay, differnet and good sauce.  Just didn't blow me away.  BF had the lobster ravioli and loved it.  My first visit I had the dish with chicken/mushrooms/pasta that is baked - yummy!  The second visit I had the rigatoni portofino - super yummy!  The bf must have really liked the lobster rav a bunch since he had it on the second visit, too!  As for the food, what did blow me away was the grilled romaine salad.  It has gorgonzola cheese and proscuitto and OMG - it does rock my world!  I may have to try this at home, which I am sure won't be quite as good as this.  This is as good as it gets!  Its a large salad so we did share (2 of us).    GREAT wine list and VERY reasonable prices. Friendly staff, servers and GM.   Look forward to going to a wine dinner, which the GM indicated they have every now and again if we get on the mail list.  So we did!  He indicated they are usually on Fridays.  Go for the view and stay for the food....and can't forget some good decent priced wine, too!
0	R65T4OV6sJ8VpNq9S4OSA	My wife and I have been there twice in the last two weeks.  Four times all together but the first two times over a year or so ago.  We were disappointed the second time we went when the Owner's wife charged us full price even though that day we went,  they had some promotional discounts and pricing on the meals we ordered.  At that time, they did not have the promos and specials listed on table placards like they do now.  So we felt that we were sort of "cheated", when we discovered this after the fact.  But then we decided to go again and give them another chance.  While their food is not the greatest and their sushi is nothing special, their pricing is fair (not low, but fair) and the food quality and quantity is acceptable.  But the thing we like is that they will accomodate special orders for things that they may have in their food/goods inventory, but are not on the menu.  My wife and I normally ask for a couple of special things that we really like but are not on traditional menus.  We appreciate the fact that they will accomodate us and do not charge us an arm and a leg for these special orders.  Also, my wife and I are big eaters and also eat the "good stuff".  So for the two of us, our bill at lunch is normally like $80 and dinner is in excess of $100.  We order stuff like toro sashimi, tempura fresh oysters, and giant shrimp tempura with tempura chiso.  The reason why I mention this is that while maybe we should not expect anything, you would think that for marketing purposes, they would try to remember their "good customers" and give us something small gratis -- like a small appetizer or maybe a small dessert.
0	N3RDH3RSNKZHYYWpGPppw	Wow! I've never experienced this kind of service with a chain pizza restaurant before. Domino's is very friendly over the phone when they take your order. It's the kind of service you would expect to receive from everyone. They are quick (usually 35 minutes) and the pizza is always hot (and yummy) when I receive it.  They've always gotten my order right (which is a big plus), I hate sending people back for ranch.   I don't order Domino's often, but when I do it's a pleasant experience.  Way to go Domino's!!
0	64sTS94al0V1m9auRDzqWQ	The good: Very friendly and warm service Lamb has great flavor Bread is fluffy and warm and amazing  The bad: Lamb was super fatty.  I had to remove half of the meat because it was all gristle and uck.  From all the other positive reviews I'm guessing I just got the blubbery ends, but it's the blubbery ends I got, so else can I review?
0	DeYU2P2N2tUNyTn93sV8IA	Be aware that they are no longer accepting the restaurant.com certificates. The food was decent but not great for the price with out the discount. We were disappointed at the change in policy since our certificate had already been purchased.
0	QcBaI0xo2pPKSRfXwvtqvw	This is a fast food chain, so I'm not expecting a dining experience. In fact, when it comes to these types of restaurants, I'm really only rating the food and the price. The food here is great and you can't beat the price. Yes, it seems a bit dirty, and yes the customer service is a bit lax, but I was sort of expecting that.
0	A15aPfqff3kOmsC3NOseg	So we finally went there for lunch today.  The decor and everything was really nice, the bar area was big, a lot of dining space and a sushi bar.  They also have an upsairs but the staircase looked to be under consturction still.    I'm going to go ahead and get right to the food though.  The main conclusion....we're still hungry.  We got the bento box which came with a dish, rice, spring roll, and salad.  The dressing on the salad was really good, and I did enjoy the spring roll.  I got the Thai Basil Chicken.  It looked really good and it wasn't bad but it didn't taste like thai chicken to me.  I don't know if it's cause they used a soy garlic sauce but when I think of thai I think of a sauce with coconut milk.  It could have been much better.  No, it should have been much better.  My friend also got a bento box.  She go the General Tzu's Chicken but with brown rice, which also has a $1 extra charge for, as well as fried rice.  Well....we don't think the rice was actually brown.  It looks like white rice that was turned brown and fried with eggs.  She even asked the waiter to make sure it was actually brown rice and he said yes.  Definitely not a healthy option if that's what you're looking for so don't bother with it.  It's a waste of the $1.  But that's not it, the chicken was just not good.  It was so bland and flavorless and quite disappointing.  It probably ruined the whole box experience.  I don't think she was very happy with her meal at all.  From their menu it looks like AZN is trying to get a decent mix of different Asian styles on their menu.  But most of what we had really lacked in flavor and that's what makes Asian food so great.  So if you want reasonably priced Chinese food that's still really good, you're better off going to Baoding.  And to get much better Thai food, go to Deejai Thai.  Both much better and highly recommended options.  I was hoping this place would be great, mainly because of it's convenience but honestly I'm not sure if I want to go back any time soon.  I know it's still new and they probably have a few kinks to work out so I'm not ruling it out completely.  And I am still curious about their sushi so I'll be going back.  I'm just not in a rush.
0	T1HUoU4VXp2spFp7fJWow	It was delicious! 2 curry chicken legs with a few, very few little pieces of potato, a side of black beans and a side of cabbage that was WONDERFUL! They only lose a star, because of the price...that small plate...$11.00! I could see $8.00 & that's about it! We got it takeout & ate it next door at Shadow & Ava Lounge.
0	O8be3vud0xoLJTlAJqXyag	Nice place, check, good mojitos, check, check, good service, triple check.  Aaaand they play live music after 11pm and have room to dance on Fridays.  Lechon Asado, mmm, yummy.  Fried yucca (manioc/casava) with mojo, even yummier.  Paella, very good.  Great time, great looking restaurant.  I'm a happy camper.
0	aR4bhWiXkKNYK0x3tzzg	Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right. Kids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down. I had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!  Worthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!  Stacky Best Of Award\u2122  Mojarra
0	GhajGUmy4AUoXpL2UzmTvA	I just went here last night with a group of people. The space is small so if you plan on going with a group, I suggest 6 or less. I had the vegetable soup and the veggie pattys. The soup was ok but from people around the table it sounded like the lentil soup was the way to go. The veggie pattys were absolutley delish and the rice was really good too. The only problem with Eden's is the space in the restaurant, it gets super crowded and, if you're sitting at the end of the table like I was, you get bumped a ton.  A great place for veggie and vegan eaters.
0	OzcnOUDAnROolw2GyIUYw	First, I want to tell you I love the Calistro California Bistro at DC Ranch, so we thought we would give the new location a try.  I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was with the experience.  Our service was slow with the exception that someone did come by three times to ask us if anyone had been to our table to take care of us.  When someone finally did come, they provided us with two menus.  Both of them were different and had different prices printed on them.  Mine had the Greek Salad for $6.00 and my wife's had a price of $9.00.  They did give us matching menus, so we ordered.  I ordered the Greek Salad and it was the worse salad I have ever had.  Feta cheese was almost invisible and all you could taste was olives.  The pulled chicken was stringy, at best.  I understand the place is new, but they really need to get it together if they want to stay in business.
0	f4WYJlHsJSqWcogh1bOcTQ	Ordered 2 Tacos earlier at the drive thru the crazy thing, it wasn't even busy. Got tacos with holes in them. Never seen this before the meat in the taco tasted funny. Long story short the lady replaced the tacos. A 2 because the 2nd set of tacos were perfect.
0	f2EPHM6jSAHQDDIX9z7g	I wanted to try a new place for delivery and my daughter wanted pizza.  This place has half price pizzas on EatCU on Thursdays, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I really should have read the reviews before I ordered! I ordered a small margherita pizza, a side of potato skins, and an order of french fries.  It took slightly under an hour to be delivered.  I do not think that the delivery guy smiled at all during our exchange, which is odd considering the amount of tip they get from me.  So, points off there for less than what I expect for customer service. Now I realize that fries don't always arrive hot since they cool quickly, but these fries were not just cool, but they were also very soggy.  I actually like soft fries, but this was too much.  The potato skins were pretty good, but they were also quite lukewarm.  I would have liked to see some green onions on them, but they didn't skimp on cheese and included an adequate portion of sour cream. The pizza was blackened around the edges, cut in a very sloppy way, and rather cold by the time I got it.  I liked the overall flavor where it wasn't burnt, but it would have tasted much, much better hot. I might be willing to try picking up my own food if I try them again, but based on the delivery experience, probably not.  I paid $20 including tip, so it wasn't outrageous even though I basically had to throw away the fries. I have had much better luck with Rosati's or Manolo's, so I'll probably stick with them.  I'm giving them two stars mostly because they are on campus and probably don't get enough bad feedback from drunken college students looking for late-night grub. They'd get a one from me in any other situation.
0	Jz2kO4OM52SStq8kbxgUcw	I have to agree with those giving this place One Star.  I have no idea who is giving the five star ratings-- friends of the owners?     Our service was horrific.  We ordered a chicken salad sandwich with no mayo on the bread.  What was made was a chicken breast on bread.  The kitchen remade the sandwich and it was awful.  The chicken was not seasoned and swimming in mayo.  Remember, we ordered it with no mayo on the bread for a reason.  We know that there will be some mayonaise in the sandwich for a binder, but did they need to use the entire jar (bottle?) in the sandwich?  We also received the wrong side-coleslaw which was also swimming in mayo.   They did bring the requested fries.  They were not hot and lacked salt.    We also saw who appeared to be the owner(s) chatting away.  Again, no greeting of guests, welcoming to the new place.        My husband ordered a Grey Goose Martini--- $12?!?!?!??!   This is Gilbert for goodness sakes.    I think that he told me that next door at Blue 32, they sell for $8 or even Brio at Santan has good martinis for less.     We have been watching and waiting for this place to open for a while.  We were really hoping that it would be a nice alternative in the East Valley for a place to go for a relaxing drink and maybe grab a bite to eat.      We were told that the grand opening is in two weeks.  We will give it another chance in a month or so hoping that the issues noted have been ironed out, understanding that a new place is going to have problems.  Maybe waiting until the kitchen staff was completely trained or at least knew where the seasonings were kept would have been a good idea before opening.
0	MjEJujl9r17q6acnN1A	This buffet just somehow does not work.  I ate breakfast and it was average lunch ditto and supper same.  They had this huge round of roast beef at dinner.  I had a slice it was so tough I could not cut it with my knife.  The other meat on the carving station was baby back ribs.  The ribs were better than average.  The salad selection was limited but very good.  The Greek Salad was very tasty.  The dessert  section was big but I don't do the sugars so I could not tell you how they tasted.  I did scope out the bread pudding for a friend of mine Stephanie in St. Louis just on the maybe she would eat here.  Stephanie the bread pudding was average sorry.  The two stars is the parent company that owns this should know better.  When the Golden Nugget buffet was under the old management it was head and shoulders above this one.  That is just not right..  They charge enough money to put better food out.  I just don't know why they won't step up to the plate.  For goodness sake Main Street Station is better as is the Paradise at the Fremont.
0	dNZLk1KOKTaOPxONzy9EA	Wow -- cheap, delicious, OK service, and upscale Arcadia vibe inside.   I'm sold.   I'm aware of the complaints of the Tempe location, so I'm on guard.  Although it's newly opened, I will def. go back to try out some more.   *Cheap* Dinner for two with an appetizer and drinks was $22.   *Delicious* The food was was great.  Cilantro jalapeno hummus?  OMG.  I'm starting to DROOL just thinking about it again!!  Tangy and zesty, but not spicy enough for you wimps out there.  And with grilled chicken and pine nuts?!?  Yum.  Beef and shawarma gyros were dependable and good.   Lots of other choices I want to try next time, esp.  the wraps, veggie burgers, pizza and spicy mango shrimp.    *OK service* This one I will let slide since it is only their second week.  Service was kind of sketchy.   It was crowded and we were told in despair by the host to pick our own table in some kind of confused blather.  Our server was cute and attentive, and quick.  She easily accomodated a change in our order.  It took a while to get place settings and menu, because, well, we were told to seat ourselves and our server wasn't aware of this.  Hopefully the confusion will be corrected over time.  *Upscale hip Arcadia vibe* Gorgeous gigantic dark-wood mirror frames the back wall of the strip mall joint.   Open layout , with full length windows and small sleek dark-wood tables throughout with a handful of patio tables out front.  Clientele of talkative (borderline loud) 30-something singles (some w. young kids) reflects the neighborhood.  A bit more polished than the Tempe location, but still OK to dress casual.
0	RjAMiyMGD6ErYTfdvtiWA	This high-end steakhouse may burn your wallet, but not your tummy. Once in a while in Vegas, I enjoy taking a break from the "buffet-galores" and eating a super succulent filet mignon at S&Ws. Excellent steak and some red wine is all you need. Don't bother with the unnecessary side dishes and starters. Then after dinner, hit the casinos and win back what you spent.
0	WMSrffZU8ARb9kQHuz3KLA	This is a 3.5 star review.  Aquaknox sits in the Venetian, in restaurant row.  The bar has a nice seating area, and is chill, without pretending to be a ultralounge.  The restaurant itself has nice ambiance... despite being on a main walking drag, you can be just inside the restaurant and it's not too loud, which is kind of a miracle.  The food was solid.  Again, I'd put the food at 3.5 stars. I had the blue cheese caesar, which was properly dressed, and had lots of flavor.  The tuna crudo and tartare were both very tasty, and used interesting flavors with the fish. It didn't make the fish the star, but it was tasty, and that's coming from a purist.
0	Bkwpt58d6bj1QDpl5xtiSg	5 dollar bowl. But holly smokes $1.69 extra for guacamole that is bland. Dame I ended up paying the original price for it. I will say no next time when ask "guacamole." Not only that count your change the cashier don't pay much attention on giving you the correct change. I gave her two 5 dollar bills for a total of $7.49 she gave me .51 cent of change. I was so caught off guard with how expensive the guacamole was I didn't recognize that she shorted me change until I left the building I guess they can consider it as a tip this time
0	osa7ImePillEeRXrhZ6Og	I went to Joe's the other night with my family. We had a terrible experience. The restaurant was not crowded, but the service was horrendous. We waited for 50 minutes for our food to arrive. I have kids and they grew very restless, waiting for their food. I had to flag down our server inorder for her to check on our table at all. The food, once it arrived, was just mediocre. The kids' meals looked as if they had been frozen and microwaved to heat. I will ever go back to this location, it was a big disappointment.
0	uCEvnHdLz79cSEdBk8bJXw	I've been waiting for this to open for a while - finally real Chinese food in the green valley area. Unfortunately their dim sum was a huge disappointment.   We went around 11am on a Saturday. Decent sized menu but not a great selection of dim sum. We just got siu mai, hargow, char siu bao, shrimp w rice noodle, and some mushroom thing - think it was mushroom caps stuffed with pork and baked.   Most of it was mediocre, but the hargow and shrimp rice noodle may have been made from spoiled shrimp. They were pretty small and had an off sour taste. Both dishes are basically just shrimp and rice noodles so the sour flavor couldn't have been anything but the shrimp. Fingers crossed that none of us get sick.   The fried rice was pretty good, if a little pricey at $9. It had great curry flavor, not spicy but with a little bit of a kick. The egg was cooked all the way thru so there was no yolk to mix up with the rice, but I still liked it.   I'm happy to have an option when I just don't feel like driving to Chinatown, but I definitely won't get their dim sum again. A huge pet peeve for me at Asian restaurants is places that don't mention that they charge for things that are generally free - rice or tea. I don't know anywhere else In town that charges for tea, but fyi its $2.50 for a pot here.
0	NJfxBen9KHxbMpYXbvoNQ	I really enjoyed my lunch here on a weekday a couple months ago.  The atmosphere was really relaxing; soft, interesting music playing, decorations were nice, seating was comfortable. The menu is definitely interesting; everything is vegan, organic, and lots of spelt-y things. I ordered the lettuce wraps, half tempeh and half "live" teriyaki. Both were really good, fresh and crunchy with good sauces. I also had some tea, can't remember which one, but they have a great selection, lots of different kinds. My friend had an "elixir" which was infused with herbs and oils to fight off a cold (she said it was good). The service was good and friendly. I can imagine if there were more people at the place it might be less enjoyable, since the draw was the relaxing quality of the restaurant (and the tea!). I'd definitely like to come back here again.
0	EB5ytDgiJxNHsKKZ8SabQ	Ok, this place is GOOD. If you love pizza then this place will not disappoint.  Most locations will deliver (like this Chandler branch), but a few will have you pick your order up. It's not a place where you eat at, in fact you might not find a table and chairs to eat your food.  Alright on to the food! What's to say? The pizza is great. It also comes with different crusts to choose from. I definitely recommend the garlic crust, or the cajun crust. I am actually not one for trying "Exotic" pizzas, but this place is get's it right.  The Howie's Wings are great as well. The BBQ wings have enought meat on them compared to other pizza restaraunts.  I expect nothing but good to great reviews for this place. Try it now!
0	GIT86Oju9E2evMq9sSmg	This place is easy (relatively) cheap fast buffet... great place to go to for lunch/breakfast if you want something simple like fresh fruits and an omelet. The ice cream waffle cones are great too.   hint... the half price tix place have discounts for this place on the weekdays. we paid less than $10 for lunch so felt like we got our worth just eating some fruits and getting lots of OJ! and we didn't have to wait at all.
0	yOAwfGHlc7wITIke3f5ew	Great food. Service could be better. Terrible managment. Hostess let friends and other go ahead in line when packed. Managment does not strive for good customer service. Had a manager who really didnt seem to care that we had been waiting and got terrible customer service. She sided with employees and made us feel like we were doing something wrong. Terrible...
0	EN3nMUf4ADCNtQSiuBHUA	I love this place. It beats Li's and Panda Express hands down. They are always friendly, the food is always fresh, and if they haven't made something I love they whip it right up for me. They also have a fantastic Tofu Kung Pao that you can order ahead and pick up that is delicious! And the portion sizes for their combos are huge. Also the soup is an incredible deal and the Hot and Sour is always spot on!
0	3xNqFUCdJEPJCLK6QWrgRA	I really enjoyed this place, had my son with me so he absolutely loved this place t.v's all over playing non-stop sports.  the variety of wings is great and the prices are pretty good as well.  This was really just a fun spot to hang out and eat wings.
0	KHCWbOMsJ8b4Dy1ekufzUA	This has become a favorite haunt of mine in my time as a UW student - this is one of my first suggestions when someone is looking for an easy, no-fuss place to get something to eat.   This place gets pretty busy before Badger home games - football, men's basketball and hockey. The restaurant sets up a tailgate in their parking lot prior to home games at Camp Randall that's worth a stop. Yes, it's the usual brats and burgers type situation, but the beer selection is markedly better than any other tailgate you'll find on Regent. This is true for the rest of the year, too - the Big Ten has a great selection of beer on tap and in bottles. I love that they've always got something new to try, too. The bartenders are knowledgeable about what's in stock and always have great recommendations.   As for the food - I've always been pretty pleased with my order. The Big Ten has osme interesting french fry selections, but they're sold a la carte. I've never really understood this menu arrangement, but they're delicious and worth the upgrade. I'm partial to the sweet potato fries with a raspberry dipping sauce, but many of my friends are hardcore wedge fry fans.   The sandwiches, burgers, and fish fries are the stars on the rest of the menu. I've ordered the Turkey Reuben and Bacon Ranch Burger over and over and over again. The Friday Fish Fry is wildly popular with families and the community - plan to wait if you want to try and get a table around the dinner hour on Friday night. I'm always amazed at the size of the fish fry - as in, full length fillets of walleye on your plate. One of the best fish fries I've ever had -- and I'm a life long Wisconsinite.
0	7Kl35yzlzpMijIpKpctp8Q	Meh indeed.  I have only had Hotpot in this restaurant so this review was only based on that. Average soup, average sauce and very limited choose of meat and veg. Good service. You can definitely get better hotpot in Edinburgh.
0	Lbl5QpgnsXfQtSWGqmWw	The epitome of a dive bar! Not necessarily in a bad way, but only giving out two stars from my experience earlier this week. For starters, it was totally dead but took the one lone lady bartender a good five minutes to notice I'd walked in- because she was so engrossed in conversation with a patron. I guess it could be worse.  There's a large sunken seating area for watching games, and this bar has DirecTV- a plus in some ways, but considering that's what I have at home, this isn't a place to go to watch a game that's on the NBA or NFL package, they don't have that here from what the bartender told me.  They do have a food menu, and a Yelp check in offer saying you get a free drink with a food purchase- but the menu looked a little overpriced for bar food and I did not choose to try it at this time. Lots of built-in poker machines built into the counter, most of the TVs are a little bit of an older style, signs up said they have karaoke on Thursdays but when I went it was completely dead- maybe I need to come back for those wings everyone's talking about.  Not sure when happy hour is- think I sign said their late one was 2AM to 5AM, but there's another one that ended at 5PM or 6PM. With normal pricing, our two small draft beers (Blue Moon and Shiner) were $8.
0	CoeJtSZP6C7ahGUiuMcSVQ	Niu rou mian (Beef noodles soup), Pai Gu Fan (Pork chop rice), e ah jian (oyster omelet), bao bing (shaved ice), shao bing you tiao + dou jiang, and boba milk tea.  Awesome selection, it's the kind of food that you would find in night markets or in small fast shops in Taiwan.  The pre-made stuff that's served like Chinese fast food does not look appetizing at all, I'd suggest you skip it, and order from the menu.  The food is really good and boba a little on the sub par side.  But overall this is one place to go to if you're craving Chinese in Phoenix!
0	QjSZi3Lo0CpDZSE6rHQ47g	We went there on NY weekend Saturday. The hostess was friendly, lots of smiles here, and asked if we were okay sitting a table in the back. We asked for a booth and were placed at one of those 2 person booths, kind of a squeeze. Our menus banged on the condiments. We ordered two draft beers, and they were flat so we told them right away, then ordered other ones and they were flat, too. Kindly, they only charged us for the second set of flat beers!  We ordered cups of chili, but they did not come. Our entrees arrived. I asked about the chili and our server said she was sorry. She said she was so preoccupied with the beer situation that she forgot. The burgers were of good size. We found gristle in each one, and my wife found a bone in hers, but I guess that's par for the course for economy burgers these days, isn't it? The porter who delivered the burgers asked if we wanted hot sauce, then came back with a bottle with about 3 shakes left in it. "Is that okay?" he asked. If your server asks if something is okay, he/she knows the answer!  The fries were pretty good, though some of mine were under-cooked and they don't have malt vinegar. The capper was the bill. You have to write down your tip prior to the waitress processing the card. She became much more officious when she discovered she received a mere 15% tip. I noticed other people sending back food that was missing little things, like the toppings they ordered on their specialty pancakes. I would recommend giving this Denny's time to figure out it's issues. Eat is great and down the street, and Hennessy's is across the street and has a great burger. Both have better food for roughly the same price. This place may be great once Denny's closes and something else opens up in it's place!

0	oBS09TMgPxrC1T4IZqbIaA	I went here with a friend a couple of weeks back and overall nothing spectacular.   Good: the atmosphere was pleasant, being that the place was filled with young professionals that were well dressed, the place was properly designed, the staff had great energy, etc. The drinks were well mixed but a little expensive. Due to the upbeat energy, I would pay a premium on the drinks. Great place for a 5 \u00e0 7. However:   Bad. The overpriced food was far from the greatest. I had calamari and the sauce was, without  exaggerating, ketchup. The well portion tartar was flavourful however the side I salad was very basic and boring. The salad was prepared as if the cook was in a rush and was late for work.   Conclusion: The place would be better if it was just a bar that served food but their liquor permit would restrict them to do so. I would only go back if I was dragged there for a birthday/office/other party. Would not go back on my own free will. If this was a purely a bar, I would absolutely go back to enjoy its great energy.

0	QR86AqpLYm767BHu6XKDqQ	I love corn dogs! Pay no attention to the mesmerizing colors of the their uniforms and to that really funny hat. You could say that I am indeed a Hot Dog on a Stick fan. For some reason they have the best corn dogs I have ever tasted and the dogs are always cooked to perfection. The fresh lemonade here is excellent. Try the cheese on a stick, I know it sounds disturbingly unhealthy and gross but in a non cardiologist point of view, I find myself actually liking this deep fried concoction. The french fries here at the Boulevard mall is the best out of all the locations in Las Vegas.   If you like corn dogs and lemonade, this place is for you.
0	6WESLZjn1xarUWdSLTRuBw	I can only handle Greek cuisine once in a while.  Is it me or do you feel heavier and a tad bit overweight after some gyros?  and fries ... and a medium coke? :)  Yeah, I know it's the voices in my head (make them stop!)  Anyways, this place is right in the food court.  I'm not a big fan of food courts in general, but I'll survive.  I thought the gyros were pretty basic.  It wasn't too bad but then again it didn't really wow my taste buds.  Order some hot dogs and hamburgers and you're in the wrong joint (it'll take a good 15 mins!)  This is just one of the 3 locations for this franchise so I gather they do pretty well.  This location is definitely for the quick (I only have 30 mins lunch break) customers.  - Enjoy!
0	hjrlLAzetYuB3zmWZnhg	Good pizza,  they've never got my order wrong. Sometimes arrives so hot the cheese is still stringy other times arrives a bit cold. Delivery are courteous.  I only order online so I can't speak to how the people who take orders are.
0	6C0KSC7meVi2wn0EbAbnNg	I'm not a fan I'm trying to figure or what I didnt like.  Could be the quality of the ingredients. Maybe not the freshest. Like chipolte it tasted very salty.  I think I prefer chipolte.  I had a beef burrito. Maybe I like fresh carne asada.  Even filbertos has better flavor beef. The diet coke was very good.  I hated the hot salsa.
0	64IRn7BB5KHT5Kj8RbuOA	My family and I have been going to Sushi Wow for several years, and I can honestly say that having been to numerous AYCE sushi joints in the Las Vegas area, I have yet to have a totally bad experience at Sushi Wow.    The place is small, and their menu maybe not as expansive as other AYCE sushi places, but the quality of the nigiri and rolls are good.    Although I haven't had a "bad" waitress here, their service is definitely hit or miss, especially with drink refills and such.  We did have one instance where the waitress tried to discourage us from ordering several rolls and orders of nigiri up front for the AYCE because she seemed to think it was "too much" for our table of 3 normal sized adults.  (3 rolls and several orders of nigiri per person.)  As frequent AYCE sushi patrons, we know pretty much exactly how much we can stuff ourselves silly with, and we know what we like.  After all, isn't that the point of AYCE sushi?  LOL  Anyways, our food came out fast and delicious like always.  I don't know, maybe it was just an off day for her or something, but it felt awkward and weird.  All in all, the other 20-something times I have eaten or ordered takeout from here, it has been fine.  The Lisa Lisa and the Wow Wow Wow are my favorite rolls, and their Japanese Lasagna is my favorite out of all of the dozens of sushi places I have been too here in Vegas.
0	JofomPs8U283qCVXdmpEw	Went to breakfast a couple of weeks ago with friends. It wasn't anything to write an awesome review about. I had the egg/mushroom omelet. I was a little runny, but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things, but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places, I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it.
0	IA7FUA4HLUzLrNwYs9rYg	"Images" ( unless they changed the name ) inside the Rainbow Casino is one of my all time favorite places in the nation to eat breakfast.  Their country friend steak is the best.  Their country gravy to die for!   Definately worth the small car ride from Vegas to try it.  Only drawback is that it's a small place so the wait can be 20+ min on a busy day.
0	smkac8vbq1XaVkVY67zRQ	This place was great. Hot, busy and crowded, but great! It's teeny tiny, but people are willing to share tables inside, and outside my sister and I set up on a little bench with no-kidding- little TV tables that worked pretty well! Do-it yourself coffee, and fantastic breakfast. I had an omelet with grape tomatoes, mozzerella, and some other veggies. It tasted like everything was bought at the Farmer's Market the day before. My sister had the chocolate chip pancakes with orange sauce-a little too sweet for me-but still fabulous. The strawberry waffles I saw other people eating looked amazing-and very seasonal! Great breakfast before we headed back to the Twin Ciites.
0	PIn29OhmvnD65GOG6EStvQ	One of my favorite pizza chain restaurants. I remember going to Roundtable pizza plenty of times as a kid in California. Great memories. I love the pizzas here because it has a great crust. The sauce and ingredients are very tasty. I always get the King Arthur's Supreme and it never disappoints. The chicken wings are also pretty good. The only place I like better than this place is Shakey's.
0	MowCGm2aL22dxQipL8A	I like how the atmosphere here has a cozy warm feel to it with its low lighting, cool wooden chairs and tables and DJs spinning some very good music.  The food has been very good too.  I love the thin crust mushroom and pepperoni pizza from their wood oven!  The pepperoni is cut into thick slices and have a spicy peppery bite to them.  I've had the crab/salad appetizer dish but wasn't that thrilled with it.  The crispy wantons (2) stuffed with shrimp and scallops surrounded by a spicy broth was delicious!  We just wished they could have added a few more wantons.  I can't wait to go back and try their mojitos and 3-cup chicken.
0	fNbHkSoobwSyaSiyjyIbfg	This burger joint is just 100% average in food. The hamburgers are very very standard (think five guys) and the fries and salads are similar. I think I have to take off a star for the weird cafeteria feel inside, and I'm tired of the whole "read the menu on a chalkboard at the front door than proceed to check out" idea. Just like at Sauce and Rumbi grill, it causes some decent traffic jams at the entrance where you feel rushed making your selections. $32 for two burgers and two beers isn't horrible, but it is when you're eating off of to-go trays. Disappointment all around.
0	OJEa67b1aVysVkBvIwGA	Best burgers and fries!  Love the ambience, the servers and of course, the shakes!  This was the first time I took my 7 year old daughter and she loved sitting at the counter.   A bit spendy for a burger joint but all around good food.
0	kodg21jI31rtYkZZfji2Q	The customer service was sub-par the few times I have ate here.  Whilst the employee was taking my order he was also talking on his blue-tooth headset and made me repeat my order multiple times, which I find unacceptable.  Also as other reviews have mentioned the speed is very slow even when the restaurant is not busy.  If you order anything they to specially make, that is NOT the pre-made rice, and curry etc. you can expect to wait 15-30 minutes. The food is decent overall, but the customer service really detracts from what could be a stellar fast food restaurant.
0	IWsD7lDa2dn7hkOrsSD1Q	Let's make the difference between strip restaurants and off-strip restaurants clear.  Strip restaurants have a captive audience who usually don't leave the casino. Strip restaurants revenue-share with the casino in exchange for valuable foot-traffic real estate. Because of this, they can and need to charge high prices for food and beverages.   Off-strip restaurants do not have a captive audience. Either they attract locals, or they attract tourists who can travel away from the casinos.  Off-strip restaurants need to work harder to attract a clientele than strip restaurants do. Because of this, they must offer something that strip restaurants do not.   The thing that works the best is the equation of:  Food and beverage as-good-as strip restaurants + a meaningfully lower price = business.  That gives us some extraordinary off-strip restaurants like The Barrymore, Vintner Grill and Lotus of Siam, plus scores of restaurants in Chinatown, to mention a few.  I'm sad to say that this "Vegas restaurant business 101" strategy has been entirely lost on 35 Steaks. Their prices are as high, and in some cases, higher than strip steakhouses, and the quality of meat is lower. The menu even makes it clear that some of their beef selections are "choice" and not "prime"; in other words, meat any of us can buy at a good butcher shop, not the best cuts reserved mostly for high-end restaurant buyers.  I had the "Rossini" which is a nice piece of center rib-eye with some foie gras on top. I ordered it medium-rare bu it came out medium-well. Usually when a kitchen gets a steak wrong, it's a matter of one level; medium-rare to medium for example. Two levels off is simply shameful for a "high-end" steakhouse.  The Hard Rock has enough trouble attracting people away from the strip, what with their casino being about the size of a video arcade, and an oddly claustrophobic layout.  What would possess them to open a restaurant that has little or no chance of attracting diners away from the dozens of other choices that are better and in many cases less expensive?  Ya got me.  Which is more than I can say for 35 Steaks + Martinis.
0	YTbDx7fYqIEFGICcwpd0WA	So again following fellow Yelp reviewers you have not led me wrong.  Searching for nearby new places to eat I came along the reviews for here and decided it was time to try some Cuban food.  I have actually pulled into the parking lot thinking about trying this place one other time but didn't so I was happy to give it a shot!   Here is a list of what we tried.  -For appetizers (Tapas) we had Empanadas de res o pollo beef or chicken we had beef.  As one reviewer before me mentioned it was a work of art it was a light crisp crust with a very flavorful filling I could have just had a few of these for dinner.   -Tamal criollo homemade tamale the masa was a darker color with a bit more flavor then what I have had before it was good however it was a bit dry for my taste. -For dinner we followed other reviewers and tried theTasting plate a combo of Roos Vieja, rich spicy beef simmered with onions and peppers.  Pollo Tequila Mar chicken with herbs and a spicy tequila  sauce.  Lechon Asado marinaded pork in a garlic olive oil this was my favorite it reminded me of a well cooked turkey dinner!  Served with Moros Cristianos a black bean rice good but saved that for lunch because this is a TON of food.   Also served with Maduros ( a fried sweet plantain)   All in all the food was good the price was fair for the serving side the ambiance was nice.  It is a busy restaurant a constant flow of people on a Monday night!  The service was good the cooking was a bit on the slow side but like I said they were very busy so I won't fault them for that because they did bring our apps before dinner so we were fine chatting while waited.   I am going back for a lunch of a cuban sandwich soon I can't wait to try that.  I also noticed them bringing out to almost every table the Batidos a Cuban milkshake in many flavors I don't quite know how I am going to fit this all into my stomach but I am going to try.
0	qQj2YjIkzWJC9vHxxyuTmg	Our waitress Kristine was super nice and very friendly! When i asked her if the veggie burger was vegan she was very kind and understanding. she explained that it was not vegan and offered other suggestions. I ended up getting the veggie wrap without the spread because the spread was dairy. The wrap was okay... it was literally cooked veggies wrapped in a tortilla so it was a tad bland and i got bored of it really quickly but that was fine. I was just happy that they had a veggie option and knew what vegan meant. I thought the place had a fun atmosphere and the customer service was awesome. There was a man walking around taking pictures of people to buy as souvenirs and we ended up buying one because it looked cute.
0	FjHM8d8aiFwqO3wwWK1fA	tried this place out last night for the first time. Went in knowing that vegan places in Montreal have a long way to go. I do, however, appreciate that they are beginning to sprout up more and more in this city.  I ordered the tofu BBQ sandwich and was pretty disappointed. it was cold and I tasted the pickles in the sandwich more than the BBQ.   had the brownie for dessert and it was no match to the other vegan one I had a week ago at Aux Vivres.  Service was lackluster. servers seemed  un happy to be working. Cashier's uniform was SO DIRTY. either he hadn't washed his uniform in a couple of weeks or he had managed to spill on himself, everything he came into contact with that day.
0	a1RJcz4hIkr8iEnrRtv2A	been here 3 times my boyfriend eats the carne asada regular tacos..  i have had the super taco.. in carne asada  and another time chicken.. the chicken seemed under cooked but it wasnt.. so kinda werid..  I came from living in NYC (the king of street tacos and taco trucks)  So Rudy's was very close to authentic..  I had their churro too YUM!   their Horchatas were just ok ok.. ive had better..  I would come here again as my boyfriend loves this place and he is picky ( i mean he cannot have onions in his food and the regular carne asada tacos arent cooked with onions- whew)  we also ordered beans and cheese nachos.. its just refried beans and shredded cheese.. no big deal but the chips were warm n good :)
0	f4hmp5QRVGPW7Go9C4kLA	This place is the opposite of fast food drive thru restaurant. The food is good thought but everything else EVERYTHING ELSE! sucks here, including the furniture and lousy employees. Are they even food handler certified? This place manager or owner needs to take note of how slow they are to serve you the food.  They have no idea of what a fast food restaurant is. None! 2 stars because if the good food.
0	nLhUavyPwUNxC3weI5vQ	My friends and I decided to check out 3pm Cafe around the time it first opened. It was around noon and there were a couple of customers there, nothing super busy. The decor was modern, cute and clean. We ended up getting the spaghetti and almond boba. The drinks were okay. The cafes in Chinatown are better. The spaghetti was good, but I wouldn't order it again. The overall menu was okay. Nothing special.   The reason why I'm giving them 2 stars is because the service was terribly slow. The workers were very friendly but it was kind of ridiculous how slow our food came out. I knew they had just opened so I tried to give them some slack, but its definitely something they need to improve on.
0	gIYoKl6j24jqlj1bj0Egg	I have never been inside, only use the drive thru. I ordered single combos and have also ordered dinner for the entire family. They have never rushed me through an order or have they messed up an order. Their food is always good and tastey. Very good location.
0	CVYEX4lszCrGCDmvrVjUjA	Great menu and atmosphere. Service wasn't the best, but the manager handled the situation very well and professionally. Unfortunately I found a dead fly tucked into the paper on my wrap. We may have had a fluke bad experience, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.
0	OiLIPq6VqSGKEFnsLqcKg	An Italian restaurant in a Chinese casino?    It's just like North Beach, then!  Our quest for Chinese food took us to the Imperial Palace, but the Italian restaurant inside turned out to be perfect for us.  It was decorated like an Italian wine cellar, with the tuns of wine in the walls, old columns, the barrel vaulted ceiling.   Like we were deep inside a hillside.  Brick walls exposed through plaster finish.  A mural of Venice, for some reason.  It reminded me that everything on The Strip is a copy of something else.    The pizza was great.  The menu had all kinds of Italian food, and it was a very pleasant experience.  Dinner for two came to about $35.
0	xObC3fy6JCrqmZBDuLKNdw	To call Five Guys the east coast version of In-N-Out does a great disservice to them and their burgers.  Yes they both hand cut their fries in the store, but where In-N-Out uses vegetable oil Five Guys uses peanut oil and offers Yummy Cajun Fries.\r \r Their burgers are also freshly made in the store.  The best part though is that there is no stupid secret menu that you need to memorize in order to get the burger exactly how you want it.  Five Guys has it all spelled out for you and a wide selection of toppings and condiments to choose from.
0	vns2hnj8u6UKlLsK6wkAw	Discovered this little place in the back corner of a strip mall near the freeway. The food is great and very delicious and they prepare it very quickly. They serve both Chinese and Japanese fare and the price is comparable to other restaurants in the area. My favorite dish here is the mein fun which uses the very thin rice noodles, similar to the kind used in traditional Filipino pancit, and no matter which protein y get with it, it all tastes very good. The war wonton soup does not disappoint either!
0	OPGn5niPRfQt71FVqlQ	I was looking forward for a good BBQ joint to set up shop in Tempe again since Big City BBQ got big time, moved out of their modest spot at Baseline and Rural and moved to Mesa.  Unfortunately, I just didn't feel the love for this place.  I went for lunch and got the lunch special which was a pulled pork sandwich with a small portion of baked beans and a drink (can of soda) for $10.  There are no other drink options besides a few sodas.  That is a quite steep for an average BBQ sandwich.  The meat was juicy, but not super flavorful.  The BBQ sauce they have is decent and helped flavor it up a bit.    The sandwich was large and I left full but with so much great food in Tempe and a few other good BBQ joints around town I probably won't stumble into this place again.    2 stars is appropriate... meh.
0	k5iKj0cN81TrKzGmlXC4XA	It's no secret I love hoarding bookmarks and eventually make my way to places that are long overdue to a visit and Kitchen 73 was one of them. My greatest disappointment was the realization that something... changed... about this place from the mostly positive earlier Yelp reviews to those that have appeared within the last week or so.   Kitchen 73 is located near the heart of Laval just off busy St-Martin street in a building that showcases a large modern interior without the warmth and color I'm used to when visiting other breakfast themed locations.   As it was Monday morning, plenty of seating was available. Awesome!  Firstly, the service was from start to end was professional, quick and accommodating. Coffee refills were taken care of quickly and follow-up needs met.  The major problem we encountered was pretty much the food.... which in itself... is actually BRINGS me to this restoraunt. I went with the strawberry crepe and my wife the choco-banane waffle. We were both dismayed by how bad the meal was considering the value we got for the price we paid.  The crepe was decent enough though the strawberries weren't as good as they can be and the English cream, which lacked actual taste was way too liquidy. My wife's waffle was decent enough as well but the chocolate felt "off", as if it were some poor imitation of actual chocolate. We were both seriously wondering when we left if the ingredients we got served were of the best quality as they can be.  Secondly, both our meals came with no sides. Usually, you'd get a side of potatoes, fruits, toasts or whatnot but both our meals didn't. It was a crepe filled with fruits and a waffle with some banana & chocolate. Coffee was included.   Perhaps we were previously spoiled elsewhere in our experiences and it's unfair to compare places to ALLO MON COCO but I can tell you for the $15 a plate we paid that this no where comes close to competition barely a few blocks away. A $15 plate with strawberry crepes elsewhere would come with fruits, potatoes, beans, toasts and whatnot.  So ultimately my experience was an average, overpriced breakfast with great service. Truth be told, I expected more and sadly for Kitchen 73, I won't be back anytime soon.
0	4DQhNufm250CsLGT4Aq9g	Decided to take my wife and family out to one of the newest restaurants in San Tan Valley.  We were seating  fairly quickly, and our waiter came and took our drink order.  When he returned with our drinks he took our food order, which included so appetizers as well.  Both appetizers, potato skins and load steak fries, were still cold in the middle and the cheese on top did not even melt.  Tried to send them back, the returned food was now burnt and way too crispy.  My wife's patty melt came out wrong and burnt as well, she sent it back and the returned one was acceptable.  My wings were okay, but way too greasy for my liking.  The worst part of the evening is when the manager came to check on us and ask us everything was.  My wife responded "not very good", and the manager said "well that's good" and walked away.  Will definitely not be returning.
0	pgnAAO7RGR2qdRIURvEMQ	It's hard to give 5 stars to a burger joint - but I thought about it.\r \r My only expectations were "expensive" as I had read something about a place with gorgonzola topped Kobe burgers.  I also didn't know if it was sit-down, counter service or what.  And does the "next-to-Barcelona" rub off in any good/bad/ugly way ?  \r \r Bottom Line:  A pleasant surprise!\r Clean, quick, quaint but modern.  And it is sit down service provided by a friendly staff.  Polite.  Not overly professional but that isn't a bad thing - they sell burgers  .... and sorry to use the phrase but what a burger.  Perfectly cooked.  Anointed with my selections of fixings - most as part of the price - and choice of buns (including wheat).\r \r And what *seems* expensive at $11 for a half pound Kobe burger ($8 for Angus half , $6 for Angus quarter pound), they serve bottomless drinks at a reasonable price ($2), and cheese, veggies, special sauces for covering your burger and a side dish were also included (best sweet potato fries I've ever had).  So in fact the net result was in line.  \r \r While I didn't have any, they also have Crab Cakes, Turkey Burger and an Organic Veggie Burger --- so plenty for lite to extreme veggie crowd! Salads and sandwiches all in the $5 - $8 range were also available --- but that's for the 4th or 5th visit.  \r \r It's a nice little corner cafe --- good for a quick but tasty bite at lunch, or even a leisurely afternoon (Quality beer on tap and it even looked like martini service - but no I didn't indulge ;-).\r \r And did I say my burger was near perfect?\r Cheers
0	naV7uLKwBR25AJtJD4A6g	This place was awkward. We came in with a group of 10 for beers and wings after softball. The hostess seemed perplexed on what to do with so many people. She greeted us then turned and disappeared and left us standing at the door for about 10 minutes, despite this place being almost empty. We weren't sure if we were getting a table or what. The waiter was not excited about a group (understandably) but he made it obvious. The wings were average, and their blue cheese tasted like and had the consistency of milk. The wings were expensive too, i think it came to $14 for a dozen wings and a soda. The inside is carpeted, which was a poor  idea seeing as it's now covered in mystery stains.
0	qoEVt0qSPpc2Ahzd0vktcQ	A HOT Dog Buffet you say? (yes a hot dog buffet and it is real good). Robin N. Rand H. and myself went here for lunch and it looked like they were going to get one or two stars because most of the trays were empty. Well as it turned out they have all these empty trays but they cook your dog when you order it which is much better anyway. There are about ten different hot dogs you can order and 3 I ate were all great. They also have all the hot dog condiments imaginable. The BBQ chicken wings are also very good.So if you like a good hot dog you will love G's.
0	ByP7SyQnD0SnyQUSwdTMXQ	The servers do not speak a word of English, and do not tell you the price until after you've eaten. We ended up paying over $17 for two people with just water to drink. The egg drop soup was terrible, the orange chicken was questionable, the rice and noodles were mediocre, and the skewered chicken must have been 50% fat. Frozen peas and carrots were generously thrown into everything, including the egg-drop soup... They also had zero sushi to offer. The selection was VERY limited. There are numerous superior asian buffets to this one in the area. Their only saving graces were their seafood and real ice cream, of which 6 flavors were available. So unless all you want is shrimp and ice cream, don't waste your time and money. 2/5
0	T13BIxkcIuca9hEXbDtccA	Tried this place for the first time, The environment is fun, bright and the IPod charging station and wi-fi are the only thing I would come back for. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, it was all lettuce and literally a teaspoon (NOT tablespoon) of chicken pieces.  The toppings were incredibly small.  $8.00 for a bowl of lettuce isn't going to impress anyone. I wanted to try the pesto chicken panini, but they only offer white bread, no other healthy or gluten free options. I was excited to try this place but walked out VERY disappointed.  Won't be back or recommend to anyone until they get real!!
0	ZOiJETaPmMfXJ5ZzUuqFYA	"Pasties" sounded, well, how can I say this delicately? Yucky. Since I ate them I had read up on them a bit and understand that they are a traditional British favorite, made of uncooked meats and vegetables baked into a pie shell. But, I still had my doubts...  I hesitantly ordered the Oggie -- my server told me it was the most traditional -- and my Significant Other chose the Lamb and Mint (?). The restaurant had an upscale "vibe" --- entertaining cooks, nice servers, smiling diners, and interesting music on the satellite radio. The prices were very reasonable and the portions HUGE. I can't say I am yet a big fan of pasties, but if you are, this place has a lot going for it.
0	JKhSNuA2Ma2rqrgcq3cqw	As I sit here writing this review, I still have a very faint smell on my fingers of mussels in white wine heaven sauce. *sniiiff* ahh, delicious. Calm down guys, I only went last night and the smell is starting to fade away. Most of it is now a fond memory.   I give this place 4 stars because my one experience, and what I ordered was great. I've heard from others that the other selections aren't as good. Stop ordering the other things then! If a place specializes in delicious mussels, year round, then order that! I got the white wine based cream sauce. It was awesome! I was drinking that stuff like it's soup, using the mussel shell as a spoon. I don't know if that's acceptable, but it's how I roll.   Other than that, the beer selection is great. I had the Maredsous 8, a darker beer, on tap. Oh boy was it tasty. The fries are really good too, and they serve it with mayo.   Yes, this joint is overpriced, but it's not as bad as the other reviews make it seem. The moules frites will run you $17, and the beer is about $7.50 (thanks to PA's drink tax, i'm sure), but you pay for what you get: good food, the cozy atmosphere of a wannabe European bistro, and on a nice day/evening you can sit outside on their patio overlooking a quaint residential area of Pittsburgh.
0	cbOZ8s3Iz7lUwkBNf2qEyQ	I reserved the private room for my wife's birthday. We had 29 people in our group and the servers did a great job servicing us. The chips & salsa varieties were excellent. Everybody loved their entrees. I ordered the carnitas tacos and liked them very much. The manager came in to greet us and make sure all was well. Again, excellent customer service! We will definitely return.
0	i5oHLrJNBAUYYfz0aCnGw	went here because it looked cool,  like those lounge bar restaurant type places they have in nyc.  again more style than substance, bit pricey, but in the village it's all about trend...  we had ravioli, and crab cake. i like the the martinis here, but it was on the sweet side...  they have 4-7 menu prices and after 10 pm prices it's a bit confusing, but it's all good, basically from 4-7 and after 10 pm it's cheaper...  crab cake was good, but barely bigger than a twonie and costing 8$? where is the rest of this poor crab that died for this dish???  the ravioli was tender and nice, but there was no sauce, just some olive oil and some pesto... hmmmm you can only get away with that if your pasta is perfect, this ravioli although nice to eat was far from perfect... i love ravioli so i'm quite  forgiving but this dish was a failure...  we skipped dessert. still 45$ for a crab cake, ravioli and a martini, bit pricey for the meal we got, it was not satisfying, i would have paid more for a better meal.

They had an "Event Menu" which seemed different than the menu I saw on their website and more expensive.  The food was awful, barely warm and poorly presented.  How they can charge what they do is beyond me.  The service was fair.  There has to be better choices for dinner at Westgate.
0	RFzfuJ7j3UPIzDe7Gd6QHg	Casual spot for creative and delicious pizza.  This is great for pre- and post-bar eating, offering up completely unique pizza flavors for a great price.  The night i was there, we got slices of mac and cheese, shepherds pie, lasagna, Philly cheese steak, and avocado/tomato/feta pizza.  You read correctly, those were all in pizza form, even the lasagna, and they tasted great. Don't expect any frills, as the pizza comes out on paper plates and the whole atmosphere is one of relaxed eating.  But honestly, if you're looking to grab some great pizza and have a beer at the same time, why worry about anything else?
0	Yxaa07h5otWp4tThZsTAzg	Not so hot...service was good, but food was very much just okay.  We'd heard the broasted chicken from the previous Arizona Joe's was now made there.  Wrong.  Same owner, but NOT the same chicken.  Very dry and not the same flavor.  Four of us had the chicken.  Four of us were disappointed.  One in our party had the hot wings.  They came out black.  Nowhere on the menu did it say "blackened" but that is what we were told after we'd sent them back to the kitchen.  Should have went with our first instinct to send them and leave them back in the kitchen, but he ate them anyway.  Very disappointed.  Won't be back.  Music (solo guitarist) was decent, service was good, beer cold, too bad the food was such a let down.
0	oWst89jggbRcnnBzgls1A	I would give Angela's 5 stars but the paper towels in the bathroom needed replacing and the caesar salad wasn't my favorite. However, the salad did grow on me (I'm not used to so many croutons- but I think that's what most people like about salads- yes?) The portions were generous and the food was delicious. I had a green pepper pizza pie (small- and it was plenty with the larger size salad- I have half the pizza left for a snack before bed!). My husband had the sausage linguine- THREE good-sized sausages! We were impressed.  Bobby was our server. He was attentive, professional and willing to laugh. Our beverages were kept full. The restaurant is entirely smoke-free (YAY!!!) AND still has a small bar. The lighting and music were perfect. Next time I may prefer sitting toward the middle instead of off to the side only because when the dessert case is opened a bright light is released (I saw many people go toward the light and they seemed to enjoy it). But nevertheless, our experience was overwhelmingly pleasant and we will be back... soon!
0	BsilHWEQaZYA9kScTEE3LA	I went to Agave for lunch yesterday with my husband and two friends in town from L.A.  I LOVE the ambience of this Mexican restaurant and all of the rock en espanol they play takes me back to the days of spending time at Tijuanas in Irvine, CA on Saturday nights.  But I digress.... The wait staff wasn't very attentive for an otherwise slow day at this venue, but the food was great.  I had the blue corn chicken enchiladas and a margarita.  No matter when you go, Agave never seems to have a full house and it makes me wonder how they keep the place going.  It's still a favorite of ours, though, and the bar layout is great for late night drinks with chips and salsa.  If you are ever in the Boca Park area, check it out.
0	M3Lc7ai4J3lBNMAzN7XqQ	I ordered the Ronin burger and wanted medium rare.  Waiter says chef recommends medium.  I say OK Medium it is.  The burger comes well done and dried up.  Egg was overcooked.  No flavor, extremely bland  Chili chicken appetizer wasn't bad, but the chicken itself was dry.  Also extremely expensive for the amount of food you get.  Prices are pretty high for "local vegas standards".  I use to live in Vegas, and paying $10-$12 for a burger (without sides) is pretty expensive.  I can get a $12 customizable burger loaded with toppings and sauces (The Counter), or an F.O. burger in LA for the same price....I don't expect to pay this in the boondocks of Vegas/Summerlin  What I liked:  Variety, serves beer, parmesan fries  What I didn't like:  blandness of food, slow service/poor, overpriced
0	841XEdhdBUpsuhVTtcv1A	I was in Tate Modern in that London fairly recently. Now, I'm not big on modern art (or art in general) but there was one installation that really riled me. Basically, it was a collection of little leather cubes arranged in a supposed 'random' way. And the sign read 'er, yah, it's like a metaphor for the banality of existence and the arbitrariness of prejudice'. Yeah, ok. Just looks like leather cubes to me.  The reason I'm telling you this is that horrible memory came back to me in Beirut. My main course was Lebanese lamb with chips. I swear they stole that installation from Tate and served it to me. It was so overcooked it was almost impossible to eat. My dining partner had basically the same, but with beef (which was equally overdone). The pickles we shared for starter were from a jar. In fact, the only good point was the sausages which were nicely spiced, if a little salty.  It's a real shame, because they've made an effort with this place. The staff were friendly, if a little inefficient (the guy next to us got his main at the same time as his starter), and it's nicely done out. It's just the food was awful. Maybe I had a bad experience, but I don't want to risk going back.
0	Jfk1ETIMItI1NvLNElH0iQ	This place is "alright" in my book. The basic fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and the teriyaki chicken was all way too salty. It seems like they over do it with the sauces to make up for the actual flavor if the food.  Not impressed. We won't be coming back.
0	Ey9lwNXC7SMca84ry3xuQ	We decided to try this location since our closest location was grossly sub par. We ordered two thin crust large pizzas with three toppings, one large stuffed crust pizza with 3 topping, 24 wings, and a chocolate chip dessert cookie. EVERYTHING tasted great. Topping were accurate, stuffed crust was appropriate, cookie was moist and not hard. Only thing that prevented us from providing a perfect score was (1) double pineapple looked more like 1.5 pineapple and (2) we were not offered cheese and peppers. Other than that, our order was FANtastic and we WILL be returning.
0	rpbgUiFsJ4hngxiAfE7k3g	A few friends (who waitress here) recommended me to Beantown and I was happily surprised.  Normally, you wouldn't find me in a bar full of Patriots fans, but this Boston themed bar had a good feel.  The owner, Donnie, actually approached my group of friends and asked us how everything was and if we were enjoying ourselves.  Of course I was!    There was a live band covering old soul jams like Curtis Mayfield and Isley Brothers and doing a damn good job at it too!  I chatted with the band members during a set break and they explained that they were also in a gospel group together and then cordially invited me to join them for service at Ebenezer Baptist Church that Sunday.  I enjoyed the diversity of the crowd, old and young alike.  That is except for the fourty-something year old that had one too many Budweisers and a taste for younger men.  It was hilarious nonetheless and I will definitely visit again.
0	572rOWEJnMYUvHwUsiILA	It's not as good as you hope. It's not a real pub. And the food is less than mediocre. I guess the real reason to stop in is for the beer. The place does look inviting but there is no table service and all the food is prepackaged. The sandwiches were mostly stale bread with very little fixings on them. We would have been better off trying a fast food spot
0	bM1ReOBZ7kHY0Hgy4AahfQ	So, I finally ate at the Maggiano's that is in the city I live in.  Previously, I had only enjoyed the take out from this location, but had never eaten inside.  When I was in Denver, I ate at the one in downtown.  The Scottsdale Maggiano's did not disappoint!  I reciecved the same wonderful service as I did in Denver, and my meal was great too!  Now, please be advised that you can order half portions or full portions.  Half portions seem to be more then enought for most people.  Now...if your cooking skill is like mine (I make really fabulous reservations, but not much else) you may want to opt for the full portion, so you'll have left overs.  YUM!!!!  Great service and great food!  Maggiano's is alway consistant...no surprises!  Go and enjoy!
0	VitAmFDfdMYKdjeJbJgjA	The drinks were excellent (especially The Regret) but the service was horrible, (my friend even got spilled on by the waiter!) and the food was even worse. The west side burger was overcooked and bland, and the steak and frites was fatty and tough. It was also extremely expensive. I would say only go here for drinks, and only if you are willing to pay ten bucks a drink!
0	AbA9eRe8FruG5ZeET0bkwQ	Wow -- finally, I've found a coffee shop in Scottsdale with more than 4 tables. Seriously.I haven't been able to find anyplace within a half-hour of my apartment that has:  1. Enough tables 2. Decent-ish coffee 3. An absence of blasting rock music  And now I found this place. Even better? Free Internet access. Why don't more place in this town have it? So, yeah, I know CP is a chain. I know the coffee isn't fabulous. I know it's in a strip mall. Sure, compared to coffeehouses in college towns, it would suck. But, for Scottsdale, it wasn't bad!  And the cappuccinos were pretty good. Also, I know other posters have complained about a loud, high-school crowd here. But, at least on a Sunday, I didn't experience that.
0	LTVz1a6SIJY4n3vwpGcFA	The girl behind the counter has a huge cold sore she kept touching. She was Wiping her nose in her arm. Didn't wash her hands before making my sub. Siiiiigh...  Walked up to the counter to get salt and pepper. The other dude behind the counter was helping  another customer, so I waited after. The girl and me made eye contact, and she walked in the back room. Everyone else was nice and clean, but the girl.... Clearly was not.
0	2trAzkOg3v3qZU3GGP5BTw	Wandered in here one afternoon, needing a quick meal and thinking that noodles might be better than Greggs or kebab. In retrospect, should have read the Yelp reviews first - and gone for the kebab!  The food itself was fine, if uninspiring. I ordered the veggie ramen and it came out a decent portion with a good amount of veggies and hearty broth, but it lacked flavor. There were no condiments on the tables, so I had to ask for chili oil, and even that didn't help much. Well, for \u00a35 it was a reasonably healthy, decent filler.   The service, however, was plum awful. The place was half-full. We were told to seat ourselves, and after doing so, waited ten minutes to be brought menus and had to finally get up and grab them ourselves. The boy was brought the wrong beer (how does one hear 'Tiger' when asked for 'Asahi'?) After I was done with my food, we tried to catch the eyes of the servers so we could get the bill - and I did a few times, but even after looking at me they continued to ignore us. I finally went up to the counter to pay, and still had to get the girl's attention, although I was standing three feet away from her and she was staring off into space! Throughout our time there, the waitstaff either stood around with blank expressions on their faces or wandered around aimlessly. The kitchen seems to be more efficient, but the waitstaff should be re-trained or simply fired. It was that bad. Next time, kebab.
0	mh5YSBypgRbZ31nNu4du5Q	I had the sliced beef pho and it was alright, except it was $7.95 for such a small bowl. It makes it seem as if the bowl is bigger, but really it's cylindrical from the bottom and has a wider top. Maybe I would have gotten a better price had I gone to a legit pho restaurant, I'm not sure because I'm not from Madison.   There was more broth than noodles and there may have been like three slices of beef in the size of elephant ears. Our first server who greeted my friends and I was generally nice, but her coworkers...not so much. Perhaps they were new, I wouldn't know. We had to ask for two waters at least three times from three different people. I honestly could have gotten up, grabbed the cups from the shelf, and poured my cup of water that was in the pitcher next to our table, in less than a minute rather than what? Almost five minutes, maybe longer?  Plus, the staff are pretty rude to their chef too. He rings the little bell to let them know that food is ready to give to customers and this one girl snaps back at him, "CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE?" Like really? We're right next to you. Take it down a notch and he's just doing his job. If the food is cold, it's on you. It's also confusing when they refer to the number of the food rather than the name. Here's an example of my friend's order: "Who ordered an NS-09?" The heck is that?! It was a type of vermicelli Vietnamese soup. Are we supposed to remember the numbers? C'mon now.  Not the greatest place and my complain is mostly about the staff. The pho again was okay. It just seems like another restaurant more tailored to American tastes and likings rather than ours. Just saying.  Again, hope this helps :).
0	jNmqG3ZmbryKUDR6Hk4hKA	Made reservations for myself and a group of 10 coworkers for noon. The waiter was good at servicing our table throughout our lunch and that's where my positive comments end. The french onion soup I ordered was very salty and the vodka 7 i ordered was VERY watered down The main course was the War Bar which I could only describe as yesterday's filet mignon chopped up, refried, mixed in with some vegetables and rice and covered with a very sugary sauce. I took five bytes left the plate
0	TDtK6AhzZYU1ha7vFyZcvA	I was in Las Vegas this week for a convention and my boss took the crew out to dinner at the Steak House one night since we were all staying at Treasure Island.  Typical steakhouse menu: The meat was anywhere between $32-$50 depending on your cut of choice, everything was a la carte with side dishes in the $8-$15 range.  Good thing boss man was taking care of the bill...  My 8 oz. filet came out with a whole bulb of roasted garlic - OH YEAH.  Automatic star just for that tasty garnish.  My filet was more of a medium than a medium rare as I ordered, but I was too exhausted and hungry after a 10 hour day of standing and trying to sell to complain about it.  I got the sauted broccolini  as my side, and an order of the bearnaise sauce.  I thought $2 for 1 oz. of sauce was ridiculous - but whadduyagunnado? It's Vegas, baby. Vegas.  Where prices are just as inflated as all the showgirls breasteses. *BA DUM BSSH*
0	IEf4YUtJzdu8TquR78w	Thinking of an omelet?  This place has them ALL!  http://www.jammsrestaurant.com/ I ordered the White Castle Omelet which was stuffed with crumbled burger!  It was huge--all of their omelets are huge!  Wilson Y. was correct when he said "The Pot of Bread is tasty and soft."  In fact, I'd try it you get to visit because the only other place I know that makes it like this is a place called the Summy House located in Manheim, PA.  Jamms is located in a strip mall along Rainbow.  Inside, it beams with natural sunlight.  The decor is upbeat with a lot of personal touches.  The staff are friendly and fast.
0	3z3NPQ31xFbM2KE6LYTJqA	Friday night in vegas with no prior dinner plans can be a pain in the you know what.  Every damn place had a wait that was a hour longer then it should be.  Marrakech is an unsuspecting nondescript store front in a shopping mall just off the strip.  It's neighbors include Ruth Chris steakhouse and some tapas place.  When you walk in you are stepping into a room with floor to ceiling carpetting and guys in mc hammer pant like costumes.  It's a pretty cool and intimate setting.  You sit on little couches and eat food with your hands.  The meal was good and portions were generous.   Later on a belly dancer came out.  It was definitely an unusual and fun part of our vacation!
0	u6mczzloeQN5uLdLmO9MuA	Creative but as flavor goes, nothing out of this world unfortunately. Conveniently right across from the Greenspun Hall, the place is cosy. It's like a subway with pitas. I ordered a gyro pita. The gyro meat is not sliced fresh, it looked like they threw a few pieces of rubber on the grill and chopped it up. The actual pita was really thin, not the thick pitas you are usually used to. They do have the option between white or wheat pitas. Just like subway, you pick what ever toppings you want. I choose lettuce, tomatoes, onions, feta cheese, a smear of hummus and tzatsiki sauce. The hummus was gritty like sand, kinda nasty. The tzatsiki was thick but it needed salt and more cucumber, it was pretty much just yogurt. The gyro meat actually had some flavor but it wasn't crunchy and juicy it was oily and soggy. I don't even think it was real gyro meat, sadly enough. For just the sandwich it was close to $8 which was not worth the price at all! I'd eat it again if it was like $5, maybe. They do offer a rewards program, you earn points for every dollar spent but you need like 90 points for a free pita sandwich and I highly doubt I'll ever eat here again. I'm going to go try Stefano's in the same plaza when I crave a gyro again.
0	wbjyKVlYywnN48gDAH5gg	The Sahara is On The Strip. I like that in an LV hotel. Also, it has a monorail station downstairs, which can take you down The Strip, to any number of OTHER cool hotels.  I think I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for The Sahara, though. I liked how they put your name on the television set, welcoming you to your room. I also liked that they made decent drinks in the casino... you know, the free ones you get while gambling?  PLUS, I won over $500 here in one day, which is pennies to some people, but for a novice like me, it was A LOTTA DOUGH!!! I was totally kvelling over my winnings! There were a mix of people in this place, too... young, middle-aged, old.... though not as many old people as were at The Plaza.   My hubby, sister, her friend, my mom and my new step dad all had a great time here! The food in the restaurants wasn't bad, either. The breakfast buffet upstairs was actually pretty darned cool, even though it's in a cafeteria-like setting. They had anything you could ever want for breakfast, and it's 'all you can eat', which is why we go to Vegas in the first place, baby!  The Sahara is a bargain for a Strip hotel. I recommend it! (Just don't expect fancy shampoos or soaps in your room, or mints on your pillow. At least the rooms didn't REEK like the ones in The Plaza.)  Go, have fun. Win some money! Just save some for ME!!!
0	WwBBOO8wDrE0e8qNeiatQ	Food was good. Service was great, nice people. Cafe was pretty cool.  They play music videos on their many flat screen TVs.  They have a bunch of memorabilias to look at.  Small store is also attached.
0	p8pjyyUrZfwNA6ZjexUw	For months now, multiple people have pestered me and pestered me to go and try Sushi Fuku. Today, I finally did, and I have to ask...what exactly is the big deal about this place?  I guess I can kind of understand the whole quickly made custom-to-order sushi thing being appealing; combine that with the prices being comparatively low, especially for the portions you get, and you have a student's dream come true. I, however, was not satisfied in the least with my meal here. I am the first to admit that I'm a complete sushi snob, so the sushi here was probably just not for me.   I ordered the dragon roll and my meal appeared impressive at first, until I took my first bite. From then on, while the sushi wasn't inedible and was certainly ok, it just didn't really taste like any sushi I had come to love. 75% of every single roll I ate here was rice. Not once did I experience the usual blissful combo of rice, meat and other filling that I usually enjoy when eating my favorite food. No wonder your portions are so cheap, people - you're barely getting what I consider the best part of an order of sushi!  In addition to my "meh" sushi I had an incredibly bland shrimp egg roll and a cup of flat Coke from the soda machine - so it's definitely worth just buying a bottle and skipping the machine, I think. I also went back to get a cup of water at the end of everything and water dispenser only gave me lemonade - I suspect someone put lemonade in both the water AND lemonade slots...  Something tells me I may find myself eating here again at some point due to peer pressure, but I won't be going out of my way to come back on my own, I think. Sushi Fuku's just not for me.
0	VhsxDm6Op3mxEuNWJXhv6Q	While walking the strip, we saw a sign that said "burgers," so we followed it and ended up here. The color scheme and "artwork" on the walls really makes no sense to me. It's like it's suppose to be sports themed, but the colors are all pink with clouds on the ceiling. It's really kind of odd.   The prices aren't too bad considering it's inside a casino. I ordered the $4.99 deal for one slice of pizza and a medium beverage and Don ordered a cheeseburger, medium drink, and curly fries for about $9.75. The pizza was surprisingly good. I didn't think I was actually going to like anything at this place, just by the looks of it, but I ended up trying to savor every bite of my pizza. The bread was fluffy and there was the perfect amount of cheese and tomato sauce. Luckily Don doesn't really like cheese, so I got to have it all to myself. He didn't mind though because he was busy being seduced by his burger and curly fries. He said the burger was delicious and described it to be juicy and somewhat like In N Out. The curly fries looked perfectly seasoned and browned. I was actually surprised they had curly fries since not many places have them. Since there is a karaoke bar nearby, we were able to have some entertainment while dining, so it was like dinner and a show (bonus).   I probably wouldn't eat here again, just because I don't hang out at Imperial Palace, nor anywhere around it, but I did have a good dining experience which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.
0	QvE8lEVGes6UXb8FfBh0fg	Good, fun sushi and martini place.  They have traditional sushi rolls as well as as their own "signature rolls."  Many of these feature ingredients like cream cheese, chicken, beef or mango.  It may sound odd but many of them are very good.  I recommend the big apple roll or the where's the beef roll.    The martinis are the best part.  They are quite simply the best I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Most of them are more on the sweet side (key lime pie, pineapple, mango, chocolate, etc.) and all the ones I have tried are great.  Wear blue on Sunday nights for 1/2 off drinks ($4.50 martinis...pretty good deal).  Cool atmosphere as well.
0	9qgVb30PBzXPXTiDYdgtw	Very good buffet. Tied with Bellagio in my book for best on the strip. The food is very 'saucy' and that sauce tends to be very similar - it's still buffet food afterall. It's also kinda' cute with it's little village inside and their attempt to make regional foods under the region signs (ok, not authentic at all but still).   I am tempted to give it just 3 stars for the horrible lines that normally await you there. Definitely try for an off time and a bit of luck...
0	yTWlcvCb02EhYPVtAKmzA	We went there just to get a "Margarita by the Yard."  It costs almost $20.  Nothing too much to complain about, they served it in a souvenir container.  The nice thing was we could held it around on the street during that July hot weather.  If I happened to be there again I think I might get that from Imperial Palace for $15.  Same thing but cheaper.
0	Z6g6nbmPgCpsz2aJ1ZxBpg	Wow. This place caught me off guard the first time I meandered through the door. From the street, it looks like it's going to be another average mexican food joint, but take one step inside and you'll immediately notice that this place has something to offer.  The food is the most authentic, best presented Mexican I've ever had at a restaurant in AZ, down the line from apps to desserts. The ambiance is perfect and befitting of a gem like this.   Servings are good size, so much so that I found it to be a little pricey for only two, but I highly recommend it on all accounts for groups of four or more.
0	L59TGGpKKAXARufu9VoYw	Really didn't love it, and really REALLY wanted to since it's within walking distance of our home.  The place seems to be having an identity crisis- upscale vs. neighborhood spot, trendy vs. homey, fine dining vs... Olive Garden?  Cold (ie refrigerated, bought elsewhere, couldn't even be bothered to pop it in the oven for show) bread in an Italian restaurant left a bad taste from the start, and the food was over-salted and heavy- nothing you couldn't make at home.  The corkage fee has been commented on but bears mentioning again- totally over the top.  This review is a bit late- we tried it in the summer- so we're going back for another shot and hoping for better.
0	2zKUAtnK4dZvjnBOSNVxg	Sometimes when I think I can't go on with the heat in Las Vegas, I go to the mall. I went yesterday with my American Express and the air conditioning. It was nice to get out of the heat and into some retail therapy.  Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba is a wonderful Tapas place at the Mall. Yes, our mall is better than yours.  Actually I hate malls, but I really can't be that mad at this one because there is so much fun stuff there!  Ba Ba Reeba is more expensive than other tapas places in town, due to its location, but I always seem to eat vegetarian here and so its a little less expensive. If and when it is under a 100 degrees outside,  I like the patio because of the pretty view to Wynn, but inside is really pretty also.
0	xBW5Oxj3umh2g3991ywXcg	What's all the fuss about?  I love to cook.....a lot. And I do that often rather than going out to spend a couple hundred dollars to be disappointed. Often, when a new restaurant opens, especially a BYOB, we usually give it plenty of time to settle in and get the bugs (not literally) out. I have to agree that there have been an abundance of new offerings in the genre in Greater Pittsburgh over the last year, and I have liked several. After having read so many great reviews, we couldn't wait to try Root 174. We had a 5:30 reservation before the Joe and Bruce Show, so we had plenty of time. We took several of our favorite wines to begin what should be an outstanding evening. Unfortunately, Root 174 didn't quite measure up to the rest of the night. We were seated right away and attended to by our server almost immediately. He was rather vanilla in his discourse regarding the menu as well as the additions. Nothing unusual in that, except that most of the service individuals that I have encountered recently in other establishments have been outstanding in their presentations and descriptions of the menu. Having read reviews of several appetizers, we opted for the beet salad, a mushroom medley, as well as the pulled pork spring roll and the brussel sprouts. These came quickly. So far, so good. They were served fresh and they were very tasty. The entrees, on the other hand, we fairly blah. When our server was asked about the descriptions of the entrees, he didn't really have much to say. I can see why. I had the trout taco. It was dry, bland, and the presentation was totally uninteresting. I ate roughly 1/3 of it and took the rest home. My brother had ordered the pumpkin gnocci. It was also presented in a very simple fashion, although it was at least tasty. It was rather sweet and he tired of it quickly. Again, doggie bag time. My sister-in-law ordered the home made sausage. Again, presented in a very rudimentary fashion and uninteresting at best....Rather dry and bland. My wife is a non-dairy consuming pescatarian, so her selection was going to be rather bland as expected. She had the vegan meatloaf, a contradiction of itself. Perhaps it was an off night. The limited menu that night, was uninteresting at best. The service was definitely on top of it, but also rather bland and nondescript. Not sure when we'll go back for a second look. I might call and ask about the menu before I'd go.
0	ZgVD3gRJtyOtki5fVsylUQ	Last night was the second time I tried it, and still have the same problem. 1. Dough has an uncooked taste 2.they only have a red sauce for the pizza, and that just leads to much acid in my system. So I will stick to making my own our will stick to dominos who at least uses real Spinach not out of a can! So gross!
0	J4lF2P2x6yUMxJKmxcqqQ	We like Firebirds. Service has always been great, and food is very good and reasonably priced. The bread they bring before your meal is delicious, especially when is hot from the oven.  I had tried the quesadillas, buffalo meatloaf, sirloin steak, and a pasta dish. The pasta was nothing to write home about.  My 1 1/2 yr old loved the mac & cheese, a definitely more upscale version than Kraft, made with penne and a white cheese sauce. I recently had the shrimp, strawberry and goat cheese salad and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp were a tad too salty, but over all it was very good. I loved the jicama and spicy pecans, it added a nice sweet crunch.   I must say that during one of our visits I was going to order the peppercorn crusted steak and the server was honest enough to tell me: Unless you reaaaaaally like pepper, you should order something else. I appreciated his honesty, because I was not interested in having steak with my peppercorns:) and I like (actually expect) my waiter to steer me in the right direction if I'm going to order something less than appetizing.
0	NTVwS0E24jVEYuKHqY1JA	I know this place is new so I will give them another chance but I have been twice and had not great service.  The first time we went for dinner and received our meals before our starters and the waiter did not even realize we never received them.  He did take one off the bill which was nice.  They then charged by boyfriends card double which took about a week to get the charges reversed.    My second visit was for lunch with a group of girlfriends and the experience was worse.  We all received our food at different times and the lost my order and one other girls order.  They did not even serve our soups at the same time, when we asked why they waitress said they were washing more bowl.  We found this very odd being that it was a weekday lunch with about 10 people in the entire place.    The food was good.  The tuna lunch bowl was really good.  Be careful if you don't like spicy because the food is spicy.  For me thats a good thing.  I love close and I am excited about the place so I hope they get the kinks worked out.  The dumplings were Yum!   Happy Eating!
0	KTtr6Z55O4W87zhSl1B2fw	I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, and I the waitress told my friends and I to sit anywhere we would like.  She was friendly, but she NEVER came to our table to take our order.  After half an hour, I decided to walk to the front register and ask for food myself, and she took my order.  I waited another HOUR, and this is fast food? This is a Saturday and there were only two people working.  Lots of other people were becoming angry and frustrated too, but I had already paid so I had not choice but to wait.  Finally, my food came out from the kitchen. Although delicious, it wasn't worth the one and a half hour wait and the management needs to fix this.  But, I could tell that the waitress and lone cook were trying there best, but it isn't adequate for a restaurant located in a casino.
0	L3706nK4ps2Jgg7nwgJfMw	The Pad Thai here is addicting! It's a really great dish here. However, the portions are very small. They use thinner noodles than most pad thais use. Their green curry is also very good but the meat is a tad on the dry side. The papaya salad was just alright though, the portion was very very small. I've been here two times and haven't been disappointed. Our server lady was very pleasant.
0	CShzniuOf6TcHPtz4Z3ilQ	The people who work here are rude. I requested half brisket and half pulled pork (instead of just 1 meat) and they made faces like it was such a pain in their rear. The workers are just unfriendly in general. Plus this place skimps you on the meat. It's a shame because the meats are really tasty.
0	f8npY0Y3LePbBxjaHzsQ	I, like another reviewer, really wanted to like Big City Dogs.  The menu sounds great, but it pretty much stopped there.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good enough for me to say that I will give them another shot.  I'm thankful I had a Groupon!
0	zaWmDiQDS82RfnxtHPL08g	I've only been here 3 times but each visit was great.   On Sunday's during the cooler months they offer, "Puppies on the Patio." What a great event, bring your dog for a free breakfast and have some good food for you. I had the french toast and my female companion had the eggs/bacon/hash browns. Both were really good. Lucy (the dog) had a chicken breast over rice and carrots. That disappeared in about 20 seconds. We came at 9:30 and it was quiet. Two other parties showed up soon after but that was it. If your pooch is on the wild side I would recommend coming early, I've heard that it can get busy.   My other visits were at 6 am. Not much going on at that hour. One of the bar tenders was pretty friendly the other was pretty obnoxious. Whatever, the food was pretty good.
0	z05Jx6dgvcnNQCz7o1w	"Tanked Fish" is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often.   Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is "Cool".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there. One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference.   I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this.   "I like" Eugene
0	QAuYChuSKznF88J7oyiw	Bangkok 9 is now just a shadow of its former self.  It is no longer my place to go for lttuce wraps as it no longer has them on the menu.  There is quite a lot missing from the menu now.  My roommate and I walked out last night because they did not have what either of us really wanted.  We wont be back.  Perhaps the food is still good.  I would not know.  For Thai in the North West, I think I'll go to Pin kaow instead.  Its too bad.  The only saving grace fro Bangkok 9 at this time is the iced tea.  It was strong and almost bitter.  Just the way I like my iced tea to be.
0	vqj4qDGAdYBA7fyT5f6Og	My parents came into town the night before I was to move out of Pittsburgh. Since they were staying at the fairmont, we didn't want to stray too far from Downtown. We all agreed that italian food was what we were craving and after googling the menu, Vallozzi's seemed perfect.   First of all, make a reservation. Otherwise you will get the pretentious once-over and will be pointed, (yes, pointed) towards the "lounge" to...seat yourself. Call me crazy, but a place that offers the exact same menu (and pricing!) in two separate dining areas should never be 'seat yourself'. That threw me off. So, as we settled into our backless benches in the beautifully decorated self seating area, we took a look at the menu and waited for our waitress.  Strike two. The waitress came over, a dark haired girl who I regrettably did not get the name of, and it was all downhill from there. My dad asked what beers they might have on draft. This is a perfectly normal question, in my opinion. They had, what appeared to be, a full service bar. Not like we could see it entirely as they had higher seating filled between our bench seats and said bar. Anyway, she replied, "I don't have drafts." Okay...are we going to offer an alternative here? No? Alrighty then. So my dad names a random bottle and she says, as snooty as possible (yes, I used the word 'snooty'), "Sir, I don't *have* that on bottle." Oh! Okay! So.......oh, we're still playing the no alternatives game. My father, getting flustered with her lack of customer service skills, "Alright, well can you tell me what you might have since you don't have a beer list?" After listening to her blatantly rushed tone, he just picked the second thing she said. My mom orders. She comes to me and I say, "I'm going to look at the drink menu a bit more and order when you come back so water for now, please." Ladies and gents, I did not ever get that mixed drink. The two times she came back to bring my parent's drinks, I tried to speak and she walked away. Alright, I'll take this delicious water. Thanks!  And so we come to strike three. Because the menu is somewhat vast, (which is great! I loved that they gave us options!) my mother asked the waitress what is popular on the menu. The waitress replies, "We don't really have anything particularly popular. Everything is great." .....WHAT?! Now, while I've never personally served, I do have many friends in the industry. When someone asks you 'should I get this vs. this', you should probably have an answer. Or you maybe should know what a popular item is on your menu. Like I said, I have many friends in the service industry so I make sure to always be as courteous as possible and tip well. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore. As she was rambling off something unintelligible to my mom, I scoffed, shook my head, and looked at my father, "How can you be a waitress somewhere and not know what a popular seller is on your menu?"   Needless to say, the rest of our meal she was very fake nice, we probably had a hocker in our pasta, and I had to physically stop myself from being polite to her. Also, my parents always tip 25%+ and I can confirm that this lady got a tip that matched her sour attitude. Maybe she was having an off night, maybe she had too many tables and was overwhelmed. Not my problem and I'm bummed my parents and I had to experience it.  And after all this angry, waste of my time rambling, I do also have to confirm that portions were disappointing and the taste was just, 'so, what?'
0	LRURbEhGtKEte2xUCUYrw	I was surprised at how unenthusiastic I was about this experience, especially given how much I love the other place (the Qing Hua near Concordia).  Here's what's not all that thrilling about the Chinatown Qing Hua: 1) Fewer dumplings.  Also a little cheaper, but still. 2) Awkward interactions with the staff.  The waiter was uncomfortable, possibly did not speak sufficient French or English, and didn't know how to seat people.  He filled tables in lines, possibly so that he wouldn't have to walk the extra four feet to cross the room, and it made for crowding and awkwardness because over half of the dining room was empty but you were still surrounded by full tables. 3) Some of the dumplings have that little ridge that's stiff.  I don't know why this happened, as it's never been the case at the other place, but I think that it might be from freezing the dumplings.  So... if you want fabulous dumplings, go to the other Qing Hua.
0	7fkomoa6vCDNWHL5nXJlzw	I am so happy when I found this place in Las Vegas! I always go there to visit my mom,  and you know... you can only go to buffet places that many times... (*shiver*  at the thought of all those food and the people gorging themselves ...... ) Anywhoo, finally search for Japanese Ramen restaurant and (yay! ^^v) found one!  They also serve spicy ramen (warning! it IS spicy! Different style from Suzu though). Portion is huge! So, if you don't want to waste food, think about sharing. They do offer half size for the basic ramen and the fried rice.   I like their selection of ramen, ranging from clear broth, to shoyu to the thick tonkatsu base and miso. If you are in the mood for something hearty, go for the thicker base soup.   I got to say though, I am not so crazy about the chicken karaage. Compared to other Chicken Karaage I've had, this one is not as tasty and juicy. :/   Therefore, go for what they are known for, their specialty, the ramen.
0	Pj084Uhju6h2k7C6vNjO0Q	As far as I'm concerned, Chef Eric nailed it with his Thai Basil Chicken entree.  Also love their thai coconut curry, pad thai, dan dan and kung pao.  The staff here is usually friendly and accurate, with no botched orders yet.  Sure the dining area can get loud, but I come here with co-workers all the time, and it hasn't yet drown out any of our conversations.  Fresh orange wedges for your fresh brewed iced tea.
0	uv4TdUUfmpGhOe2ydRQcKA	This place is a great value.  Food was served in generous portions, you get complimentary wine and prices were very reasonable for dinner (especially if you like Italian food).  I'd say the entrees were better than average but some were better than others.  The garlic bread is so dangerous.  They just kept refilling our baskets.  so tricky..  It's a nice change from spending too much in one of the hotel spots and it has "character" (or something like that cozy feeling).  Apparently, it's been around for a while and they have all these pictures of stuff/people from the past.  It's right off the Strip too but definitely gets pretty busy so make reservations.
0	TrSEwOjsoGTTqeJEuQtoA	I stopped here for lunch the other day. The lunch specials were $7.25 so I ordered the Pepper Steak. The lady asked what level spice I wanted it so I tried level 8. The pepper steak had great flavor but I would go for level 10 next time since it could have been spicier for my taste. The meal started with a soup that I just thought was okay and a salad that I didn't try. The egg roll and rice that came with my pepper steak was real good.  Service was good and the food came out quick. The price was right and portion of food good so I will stop by for lunch again.
0	MLo0stZByYXSSftZS9BzBQ	a friend and i walked in with literally 25 minutes to eat. we told the host and he was like "yeah, we can get the food out for you". awesome. we got some nice seats at the bar right in front of some flatscreens playing the giants game. honestly, 5 minutes later our food comes up nice and hot. the gyro platter was pretty yummy. the gyro meat was on point and there was a lot of it. my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs which was also very good. service was great and our waiter was super cute...definitely a bonus. =)
0	1Zv94FyT0rIkJUrFhNKaHg	There's really not much to dislike here. Plenty of combinations and fresh cut fries. A sub, fries, and a drink can get pricey but it's very high quality. So you will get your money's worth.  Now if only they offered a wheat bread. Only white is offered. It's VERY good and soft white bread, which should be noted.
0	lfJVdUukAX7L7nOBITzP2w	I ordered Chicken with Broccoli, Grandfather's chicken, and fried dumplings. All dishes were subpar. The Gradfather's chicken was supposed to be all white meat, but they was definitely dark meat mixed in. The chicken in the other dish tasted old and the dumplings were all dough no meat and tasteless.
0	VYtx0MRhnqEpCqAEge0OVQ	Driving down Scottsdale Road today and was craving Fitness Cafe... but they are closed temporarily for renovations.  Bummer!    So, I went to Dilly's Deli as an alternative and I was pleased.  I had the chicken salad salad.  For $6.19, I thought it was such a deal!  It is a pretty big portion and comes with a slice of fresh bread.  This probably was not the healthiest choice, but it tasted good!  Next time, I will order without croutons as they had a little too much garlic flavor.  Actually, next time I will take Sam's advice and go with a sandwich!  Quick, fresh, cheap, and tasty with something for everyone... I'll be back Dilly's!
0	3LiLbCd3sxDnUZdeiw	If you want a lot of food, this is the place for you.  If you want a lot of good food, not so much.  The burgers are huge, but overcooked, dry and tasteless ; this is the one time bacon didn't help.  The fries cold with no added salt.  The service is fast and friendly. I suppose there is a customer for this type of place; sadly it's not me.
0	hwBWNHx4l0v9yQLw7zvQ	I really enjoy the food at Native. The wing flavors are better than that of Buffalo Wild Wings and the prices are slightly better. However, I have been to this location 4 times and I have to be honest, it just seems like they don't really try at all. Customer service in Casa Grande is hard to come by (the best place for service is The Big House Cafe and that's pretty much it) but Native really misses the mark every time. My wait is far too long without any explanation. Waiters are aloof, don't pay the customers enough attention, and I sat an entire meal once without a drink refill. The only way to eat the food without being frustrated and disappointed is to call and place an order and then pick it up half an hour later. Apart from that, prepare to be upset.
0	yEwKt6ArwiDRHnDLL2pBA	I love this place! Great service and good food.  The only downfall is that it's in a run down area, but the food is great. They have the best summer rolls in town. I go there for their Vietnamese pho, vermecilli salads and summer rolls. And of course their bubble tea are super yummy also!  If you love Vietnamse food you won't go wrong with this place.
0	xfmviSCCeHaWJDS1POhg	Tried this place for the first time and got their version of an Italian. The ingredients quality was fine enough but I gotta say their Italian is nothing more than just a ham sandwich. If I wanted a ham sandwich I would have ordered just that. Where is the salami Mike?  If you want a real Italian Sub ladies and gents head up to 16th St & Bethany Home Rd. to Niccoli's and get it done right!
0	ffbhkieH9FYEaU8kUCVDog	After spending some time walking around in downtown Pittsburgh, a few friends and I found ourselves in Market Square, and in a very hungry state. Seeing that our first choice of restaurant was closed, we decided to give Diamond Market Bar & Grill a chance despite the less than stellar reviews.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was first impressed at how clean the place was, and our server initially seemed very friendly and helpful. However, as the meal progressed, it became evident that she would only return to the table if you blatantly called for her across the restaurant, something that quickly became annoying.  The food here isn't cheap, but it isn't super expensive either. I think I got away with ordering a burger and fries for about $10-12. However, Diamond Market definitely does not have the best food you will ever taste. On the other hand, it isn't the worst either. It's just very, very, bland. On top of this, our server did not give my sisters order right, which I know happens, but we were the only people in the restaurant so its not like she was too busy to take the extra second and pay more attention.  When all is said and done, I would not personally return to Diamond Market, but I suppose it could do in a pinch.
0	zbxgCDp6wYGFI1GAuuI0FA	I'm not a hookah-girl, but that room that they've got at the Sahara location is absolutely beautiful.  Here's what I have to say about Paymon's-- the food is excellent.  My favorite thing to get is a Greek salad and add on the salmon.  They make a light, but flavorful house dressing, just the right amount of cheese, and plenty of veggies.  It's definitely enough to fill you for a whole meal, or to share with a friend while you also order a round of their great appetizers (like hummus, grape leaves, etc).    It's also a good starter place if you are new to Mediterranean and Greek fare as the staff is generally knowledgeable, and the menus are pretty comprehensive.   It's a great place to eat for a casual date or lunch meeting.
0	bMf5te6kUWLIoRQVLha2g	I love burgers. I've said it once, and ill say it again, my last meal on earth would absolutely be a burger. It will be juicy and meaty, the bun will be dry and toasty and there will be more pickles than you can count.. It will be accompanied by a mound of delicious french fries and a giant milkshake... Today at lunch, I was invited to try a new burger joint, which apparently everyone loves, and was told that my love affair with In&Out would be shattered.. Well, that was a lie.   I got a cheese burger, fries and a cherry coke. The sheer fact that there is fountain cherry coke automatically merits a star. I liked the options I got for toppings, I chose mayo, pickles, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce and A-1..  I've got to admit, I was excited, really excited.. however, that excitement was quickly shattered when I got my meal.. I unwrapped the tin foil, hoping to find a delicious juicy cheeseburger, just for me.. yeah well, I found a burger, just for me, but it was WET. The entire bun was drenched.. THIS, ladies and gents, this disgusts me to no end. One of the words I hate most in the world is moist, and I also hate when things that are not supposed to be moist, are moist. Especially bread. BARF. The meat wasn't very flavorful either.. and they used portobello mushrooms, that were cold. I frowned. My lunch date frowned back. The fries were apparently from Shelly Idaho, I know this because they have a "Todays fries are from.." board.. they taste just like In&Outs, just thicker.. so basically it is imperative that you order them well done.  The place is big, holds a lot of people and they are really well staffed, but the meal was just meh.. and for the two of us the total came out to be $22.00. TWENTY TWO DOLLARS for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and a drink.. for real??   Whatever, i know its inevitable that I will give this place another shot, mostly because I work next door, and Fat Burger doesn't do it for me.. But I was just really really sad with the whole experience. I don't eat burgers often, so when I do its a treat, and well, this was not a treat.   *sigh*
0	IPx6TRRRpOMnCbyVTbtqow	The finest Mexican food, will not be found here, but hey you what you were getting into when you walked in to this joint, and if you didn't please contact me, I have some land in Florida I would like to sell you. That being said, this place was pretty good as fast food goes. I signed up for the Del Taco email club, and got a coupon for two free chicken soft tacos. the rest of my order consisted of what felt like 3 pounds of food, and the bill came out to around $5. That my friends is what we call a bargain. So So if its late at night and you have had a touch of the creature, or at least wish you had,stop by and spend a buck or three. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
0	GPgyOuOa4KnGYOPMdr8w	This is a restaurant that's trying to provide a 4 star quality and didn't quite make the mark. Open concept kitchen with poor ventilation. My eyes burned from the smoke. Food was average and didn't live up to the descriptions listed on the menu. The brie and caramelized onion tarts are lovely and well worth the $8.00 purchase. However, for what we paid for the rest of dinner, the server should not have been chewing gum.
0	dbMF47uo0ibaeL7t6mBZPA	So here's the deal on JITB.  In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location.  We have only gotten the oreo shakes.  (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon)  So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food.  The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed.  The food honestly was not good.  A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink.  The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry.  The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them.  Really aside from the occasional oreo shake I will not be returning to this place for anything else.
0	YQZf6DicOdnjWxqhQ3RpA	Mediocre Thai food. Go here if you want a cheap meal, but not for much else. I will allow that I didn't try the O'Burger side of the restaurant, but if the burgers look anything like the posters they had up, it was a good call on my part.
0	1yhV7Ou9LUOYMHoG0Ki8Q	Ah yes, Circo. Well, this place is not for everyone. I wouldn't exactly say you get a lot for your buck, but what you do get is amazing lamb chops and steaks. Side dishes are above par, and the wine is too, but you do pay. My first visit there, with my friends (party of five) came out to about $600.00, but that was partly due to some expensive wines. The location is superb. If you have ever been the Belagio and have seen the water show from the sidewalk, well in Circo, you see the show from your seat inside and it is fabulous. (Oh no I di'int just use the word fabulous)  My first of two visits here was a few years ago when Ocean's 11 was being filmed and as we were chowing, in walks Clooney and two hot trophey's in tow. This is definitely a place stars visit. Food really is good and if price is no object to you, then the good service and food make it worth it. Of course, there are a lot of choices in Vegas, this place just happens to have a great location.  Ask for a window seat. Of course, if price is a factor, keep looking.  Sometimes a $12.00 Prime Rib casino buffet tastes as good as a $100.00 dinner. As long as you don't mind sitting next to a woman with pink sweats, a fanny-pack, Herbie The Love Bug T-shirt and a Stratosphere pink visor and her hubby that has a gut the size of Rhode Island, but still insists on tucking his undersized Nascar Tshirt in, sporting his name on his belt buckle while wearing socks in his sandals.
0	Y6VZkR6jWBpO2B1xeUB4A	Went about 3:00 knowing it wasn't lunch or dinner. That waitress never told us her name but started with "what do you want to drink?" Cornbread was great, warm and fresh. My friend got hush puppies and they were raw in the middle. The pork was dry. Finally at the end I got the to go boxes myself and had to walk to the bar to get her for bills. She had two other tables when we got there and they were gone shortly after.   I did get some sauces to go and they were reasonably priced.   Won't be back.
0	S2rhaz4KKComrRaltljprQ	had pizza next door at barros, wanted something sweet like ice cream. go next door to brownies at 730pm, first thing the young girl yells" we are closed, unless you wanted ice cream only", we looked baffled that we are "only" allowed to get ice cream, the rest of the menu is off-limits.as we are eating our ice cream outside, at least 3 families came to the door, but the door was locked at 740pm, sign clearly states that they are open till 8pm on friday. disappointed in the young ladies working that nite 4\\5\\13.
0	ZXiI8F9bShgpTD8OdoLU9A	Its BK, what can I say?!  My son and I love coming here on a hot day after the library!! Here its a little hidden, but once you get here its super nice and air conditioned! We've been here a few times and each time its been pretty swell!   The wait is usually short bc its not always busy, the cashiers are pretty nice also, except one of the weirdos who told the manager she wasnt going to refill the ice in the machine.  The prices here are comparable, although I dont usually eat the burgers I do sometimes like the onion rings. What I really come here for, in addition to the kids meals, are the fruit smoothies and sundaes! The ice cream here is seriously sooooooooo yummy! And its only 1$ for a sundae! The mango smoothies are also super yummy and are 2$ and change!  My son loves the kids meals here, they include your entree but what he loves most is the paper crown attached.  They also usually have some pretty neat childrens toys.  So we will def continue coming here for the cheap eats, and nice cooled play area!
0	x344PtpeVzODci9JdaSRQ	I've been a regular for about 2 or 3 years and I've never been disappointed. I usually order the Combo Plate. I'm a fan of the Honey Chicken, Thai Chicken and Beef Teriyaki. SO Freakn delicious. It's serve with a side of salad in a sweet and slightly tangy sauce and cabbage salad (you gotta have something light to eat with the savory).  The meats are packed with flavor and love that it sits and sort of seeps down the rice giving the rice a bit of the goodness!   ^u^
0	TuttLgkvuytFflqdLgyg5A	Amazing setting .. stupendous views inside and out (I wouldn't mind getting married here!). Service was top-notch; I can say nothing bad about it (the hostess even called me the next day to thank me for coming in!).  The menu was a bit limited (but changes often ... I like that). The portions tended towards the small side, but totally satisfying.   The prices are rather high, so this isn't your typical "happy hour" locale. However, for a special occasion and/or special someone, you would be hard-pressed to find a better location.
0	SSvNfOtDgzcblmTsmwprw	Love this place!  Been there twice.  Keep an eye out for the swordfish, if they have it, order it!  They have an amazing wine selection.  If you can't find what your looking for there, you simply don't know what you want.  Staff is excellent.  Price are high BUT well worth it .85709
0	rtD9zsdeiKFWZwAX2jwJA	Swish is a cute modern shabu shabu/sukiyaki joint.  This is some pretty healthy cuisine (shabu shabu). Good service. Although the portions can be a bit small for a few folks, but it filled me up. A good place to have fun with food!
0	bWy9o0PyVLtN1PPfZDvOUQ	Stopped into this subway in my hood this evening to feed the family, since my self cleaning oven took it's sweet time cleaning itself. No complaints of cleanliness and decor, even the sammiches were good, it was the service that sucked. Employees there did not greet nor smile, to make things worse, homegirl looked like captain cavemans sister. Pretty serious mug on her and her partner who was also inattentive needed a hair cut to boot. The thing that bummed me out was they had no fresh cookies on deck. What the eff.
0	T1RCToAj2O2wQjijMC7R0Q	The food at Big Burrito isn't that bad but they have a lot of work to do.  I cannot think of a reason to visit this establishment over the other Mexican fast food joints.  I ordered the enchilada and burrito combo with carnitas.  The pork was diced as opposed to shredded and it was not very tasty.  To their credit, though, the portions were fair and I did not leave hungry.  The folks do a good job of keeping the place clean which is not the norm at other places I've been to.  If you're already in the area and in need of nourishment, Big Burrito is not a bad option.  Just don't expect anything special.  It's edible.
0	yp8KEk4jEA2875QHgahQ	Went last Friday night. Food was very good. We all ordered seafood. The service was also top notch. We ordered a seafood tower and they forgot to bring it. When we reminded them are dinner had arrived. He brought it out anyways and didnt charge us ($125 value).It should get 5 star but I only gave it a four star, because the atmosphere was lousy. They are missing the big picture. they have all the right "ingredients" great food and great service, but NO atmosphere.
0	Et8HhsvH6wQ7HOUezO6tA	Ordered two sesame chicken lunch specials to go. Waited about 37 mins while my buddy and three others who ordered before me had already had their meals ready. Next time ill just call it in which I advise everyone else to do. The pork fried rice is the best in town.

There were quite a few patrons at the bar, but it is a separate area for the restaurant. All closed in with doors.  The food was nothing special. I had an omelet, it was on the small side, now do not get me wrong it was enough, I think we get so used to some places with their huge portions, when we see a regular portion it looks small. The potatoes were crispy but I wish the peppers were softer. BF had the pancakes and eggs, he said the pancakes were decent.  I thought we paid a little too much for what we had, 16.00 for the two of us.  The staff was very friendly.  Would I go back probably not. I would not make a special trip there.

Waitress checked back often to see if I was happy.   All a great deal for a $13 lunch with beer and tax!    Would love to see the bar going. Looks like a hopping place for later.

The pizza is thin and crispy which I like very much, but the toppings are expensive and the pizza became very greasy after some time. My advice is to skip the pastas here, as they are also very greasy and the tomato sauce lacks any flavor. I've never experienced poor service here, but if you come for the lunch buffet, you may have to wait for them to rotate the pizzas. It's very inexpensive to eat the buffet, but be sure to request a certain type of pizza if you don't love everything. Only two pies go out at a time, and they are often sausage or pepperoni.
